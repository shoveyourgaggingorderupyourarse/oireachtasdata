The terms of this agreement provides for the establishment of a new company which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services. It is vitally important that the legal and governance arrangements associated with this project are robust. Considerable work has been undertaken to develop a legal framework to protect the State's significant investment in the new hospital and ensure the hospital building remains in State ownership; it is hoped to conclude this work shortly. This legal framework will underpin the operational and clinical independence of the new hospital, ensuring care in the new maternity hospital will be delivered without religious, ethnic or other distinction and any medical procedure which is in accordance with the laws of the land will be carried out there. Once finalised, proposals will be subject to consideration with the parties concerned. I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the development of the new maternity hospital on the St Vincent's campus. This is a vital project for women and babies in Ireland, representing the flagship project of the National Maternity Strategy and the largest single investment ever made in maternity services in Ireland. The model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally. Government policy is therefore to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute services in order to provide optimal clinical outcomes. In that context, it is proposed to relocate not only the NMH, but also University Maternity Hospital Limerick to University Hospital Limerick, Dooradoyle, the Rotunda Hospital to the Connolly Hospital campus in Blanchardstown and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital, to St James's Hospital.

The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year. The Strategy emphasises the need for a \"whole community response\" to dementia, as the majority of people with dementia live in their own communities and wish to avail of services in their local area.<\/p>  <p>  To support future development of services and supports for people with dementia, the National Dementia Office and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland undertook a joint project in 2016 and 2017 to map dementia-specific community-based services across the country. Information from the project is included in an on-line service finder on the Understand Together website so people can find out what services are available in each county.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.<\/p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published on 26 September. It recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these community supports, in 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home. These were initially co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies and now fully funded by the HSE, which has committed to continue to provide approximately 120 packages at any one time. In addition to the IHCPs, people with dementia are also able to avail of standard home care services on the basis of need and within the resources available.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured &euro;6.26 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund for numerous projects to improve care and supports for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a national dementia registry; the national rollout of a dementia training programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of dementia resource centres; funding for a dementia community activation coordinator; and community support projects for people with dementia. <\/p>  <p>  In July and September, I met with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland to discuss dementia issues.

This represents a 16% reduction in the overall number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2019 the Government has further increased investment in this area, with funding to the NTPF to increase from &euro;55m in 2018 to &euro;75m in 2019. In 2019, the NTPF plans to deliver 25,000 Inpatient Day Case treatments, building on the 20,000 procedures delivered in 2018. In addition, 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes will be carried out, bringing to 9,000 the additional scope activity provided by the NTPF since the start of 2018. Furthermore, 40,000 Outpatient appointments will be arranged as part of 2019 activity. It is expected that a further 34,000 patients who no longer need treatment will be removed from the waiting lists by the NTPF Central Validation Unit.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, the NTPF projects by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the IPDC waiting list from just over 86,000 in July 2017, to 70,000 at the end of 2018 and to under 59,000 by the end of 2019. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise the 2019 Waiting List Initiatives before the end of this year. This will include the continuing engagement of the NTPF with the HSE and public hospitals, inviting proposals for waiting list initiatives either through the private sector or through public sector insourcing. The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the recent Budget provided an increase of &euro;1.05 billion in Health funding. This brings the health budget for 2019 to &euro;17 billion. This is the highest level of Health investment in the history of the State. This will allow the health service to meet additional demands caused by the demographic pressure of a growing and ageing population. The additional funding provided as part of Budget 2019 will directly support a range of additional services including initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. Sl&aacute;intecare will focus on meeting the demand for health care that our population currently has, and which will continue to grow in future years. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive is currently in the process of finalising its National Service Plan for 2019, in consultation with officials from my Department.

The NTPF estimates that 30,000 patients who no longer require treatment will come off the outpatient waiting list in 2019 as a result of this activity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Data","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[43525\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number and cost of all external reviews and-or investigations of patient care at Galway University Hospital in each of the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Action Plans","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC01800"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[43543\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reduce waiting lists in hospitals in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for the Government.

The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate.  <\/p>  <p>  I also recently met with the CEO&rsquo;s of all hospital groups to discuss improving access for patients and requested that they work with the NTPF and HSE to develop innovative proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the HSE advises that construction was completed on Phase I of the expansion of Paediatric Department Cork University Hospital (CUH), which became operational in March 2017.

The number of GPs on the specialist register continues to increase &ndash; up from 2,270 in 2010 to 3,669 as at July 2018. The number of GPs holding GMS contracts has also risen from 2,098 in 2008 to 2,507 as at 1 September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of workforce issues facing general practice, including the influence of demographic factors, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice.<\/p>  <p>   GP training places have been increased from 120 in 2009 to 193 places filled in 2018, an increase of around 60% over a nine year period. The Government's objective is to continue to achieve annual increases in the number of training places available while ensuring that all of the places are filled.<\/p>  <p>  Entry provisions to the GMS scheme have been changed to accommodate more flexible GMS contracts and the retirement age for GPs has been extended to 72. An enhanced support package for rural practices has been introduced with improved qualifying criteria and an increased financial allowance of &euro;20,000 per annum. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the HSE recently re-engaged with the Irish Medical Organisation to set out the State's position in relation to reform of the GMS contract. Agreement on the delivery of service improvements and contractual reform has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multiannual basis. <\/p>  <p>   Under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, GPs are reimbursed for a range of services they provide to medical card and GP visit card holders. GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service. GPs are also remunerated for services they provide on behalf of the HSE under other public health schemes, such as the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, etc. <\/p>  <p>  Despite reductions to the payment rates of health contractors made under FEMPI legislation, the total fees paid to GPs under the GMS scheme have increased from just over &euro;472 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;525 million in 2017. This increase in fees is largely due to significant developments and investment in GP services introduced in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional financial support provided by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>   The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 now allows the setting and varying of contractor payments on a non-emergency statutory basis. It is my intention to put in place a new multiannual approach to fees in return for service improvements and contractual reforms based upon health policy considerations and engagement with representative bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Data","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[43271\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300066#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons waiting for urology tests in each region; the average waiting time in each region; the steps he will take to ensure the HSE has the resources to deal with this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy has been provided by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) at Hospital Group level and can be found on the attached spread sheet. <\/p><p>Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for the Government.

Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.

In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations balloted their members, who voted to accept the terms of these pay agreements. <\/p>  <p>  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The first increase due under this agreement from 1 January 2018 has been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel and a second increase has been applied from 1 October 2018. Further increases in pay under this agreement are scheduled for 2019 and 2020. <\/p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The recently announced proposal by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and reform in respect of new entrant payscales will also benefit those who joined the Defence Forces since January 2011. <\/p>  <p>  Measures such as the implementation of the Working Time Directive for members of the Permanent Defence Force and a review of contracts for enlisted personnel are under active consideration.

The Commission will provide the Council with an update on the relevant infringement procedures at its next meeting.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s concerns about issues relating to the rule of law and the importance it attaches to the values on which the European Union is founded are well known and stressed, as appropriate, in Council meetings and in bilateral engagements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":337,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[43341\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if financial support to assist the Yazidi, including support to assist with therapy and treatment, has been considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[43342\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he has taken at European level to assist the Yazidi; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 184 together.<\/p><p>The Government attaches great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination or persecution based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to religious hatred, irrespective of where it occurs or who the victims are. We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  Many minority religious and ethnic communities across the Middle East are vulnerable to violence by state and non-state actors, including terrorist attacks. Ireland has consistently called for inclusive, democratic solutions to the conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa region.<\/p><p>I participated in the Third International Conference on the victims of ethnic and religious violence in the Middle East, which took place in Brussels in May this year. The Conference brought together 67 countries and 13 international organisations, to find ways to further support the members of the communities targeted by Da&rsquo;esh and other extremist organisations for ethnic or religious reasons, particularly in Iraq and Syria.<\/p><p>I unreservedly condemn the brutal atrocities which terrorist groups, including Da&rsquo;esh, have inflicted in Iraq and Syria, including against religious minorities, notably the Yazidis. I am appalled by the suffering of the innocent people caught up in these events, especially women and girls who were targeted by sexual and gender-based violence. While the situation has improved, with a successful fight back against Da&rsquo;esh in Iraq and Syria, challenges remain in terms of healing the trauma these groups have endured, ensuring humanitarian aid reaches them, and ensuring displaced populations can return to their homelands once it is safe to do so.<\/p><p>In the Iraqi context, Ireland has always emphasised that the security effort must be accompanied by national reconciliation to ensure an inclusive state, allowing for political, economic and social opportunities for all. The January 2018 EU Foreign Affairs Council conclusions on Iraq reiterated the EU&rsquo;s firm and active commitment to the preservation of the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-confessional nature of Iraqi society, including the protection of its minority groups, building on the bond of a common national identity and inclusive citizenship.<b><\/b>The EU stands ready to support Iraqi and international efforts to hold members of Da'esh to account, and ensure accountability for human rights violations and abuses, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as acts against persons belonging to minority groups.  Ireland fully supports these conclusions.<\/p><p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided just over &euro;9.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq including &euro;2 million to the UN Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF) in 2018 alone. The IHF ensures funding is allocated to the best-placed organisations, and that these funds are targeted towards those in greatest need.<\/p><p>Ireland also contributes to the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Iraq which has provided over &euro;40 million this year. This funding goes to the most vulnerable people, for a range of services. This includes a grant in recent months of &euro;5 million towards emergency reproductive and mental health care for victims of violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF01000"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[43343\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason the public consultation paper on Ireland's international development policy makes no reference to LGBT issues; if he will review this in view of the ongoing discriminatory and violent treatment of the LGBT community in particular countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>The promotion and protection of human rights is at the heart of Irish foreign policy.

The Government fully endorses the legitimate aspiration to unity expressed in Article 3 of the Constitution, as amended by the people in 1998.<\/p>  <p>  The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are fundamental elements of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island North and South.  The Agreement states clearly that &ldquo;it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right to self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Agreement, the two Governments &ldquo;recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Britain or a sovereign united Ireland&rdquo;.  And should such a choice be made in the future, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.<\/p>  <p>  The trigger for a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland.  This would occur when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland considers it likely that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  At present, the Government does not believe it likely that such a border poll in the near future would result in a decision on the part of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland in favour of constitutional change.  In these circumstances, it is the Government&rsquo;s clear view that such a poll would only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of the prospect of a referendum in the near future, the Government has no immediate plans for specific preparations on this issue.  My immediate priorities are to secure the functioning of the devolved power-sharing institutions and the North South Ministerial Council, which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, and to ensure the protection of the Agreement in all its parts and the gains and benefits of the Peace Process, through the ongoing Article 50 negotiation between the European Union and the UK, which are at a critical point.<\/p>  <p>  In the event of a future referendum within the consent provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government would make all necessary preparations in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and the principles and procedures of the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  There are of course aspects of this constitutional issue which relate to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work.  In the context of Brexit, the Government has made clear its determination to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including those provisions relating to a possible change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status within the EU.  As a result of intensive political and diplomatic engagement by the Government, we have secured the solidarity and support of all our EU partners on ensuring the protection of the Agreement in all its parts and of the gains and benefits of the Peace Process, through the process of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 April 2017, the European Council adopted Guidelines for the EU-UK negotiations which included a strong acknowledgment of the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland and the importance of preserving the achievements, benefits, and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.  These Guidelines remain the basis of the Union&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations with the UK, including on the Ireland-specific issues.  Also on 29 April last year, the European Council agreed a statement acknowledging that the Good Friday Agreement provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about and that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been very clear that we do not see the UK exit from the European Union as a pretext or an opportunity for the holding of a border poll in Northern Ireland, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[43731\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300069#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the categories of funding available to local authorities through his Department; the amount of funding provided for each scheme in 2016 and 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>My Department administers a number of funding programmes, including Ireland's official overseas development programme, Irish Aid, and the Emigrant Support Programme which supports Irish communities overseas.

Mr Barnier has been flexible and imaginative in seeking to find ways to address and de-dramatise this issue, and Ireland strongly supports his approach.<\/p><p>A legally operable &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; which avoids a hard border, and protects the integrity of the single market, is essential for agreeing the Withdrawal Agreement, so as to provide the certainty that no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the future relationship, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  As agreed last March, it must be in place unless and until another solution is found.  This was clearly reaffirmed by all colleagues at the GAC, and subsequently at the European Council meeting on 17 October.<\/p><p>We are now in the end game of these negotiations, and time is short.

I have asked my officials to further discuss this matter with Revenue with a view to improving the data quality in this area  <b>. <\/b><\/p><p>I extended the benefit-in-kind exemption for electric vehicles until 31 December 2021 to support policies to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. This forms part of a broader series of measures to support the uptake of electric vehicles, including\u00a0VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, an SEAI grant of up to &euro;5,000, very low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, 50% discount off tolls fees and 0% BIK on electric charging.<\/p><p>Having regard to value for money and tax equity considerations, a cap of &euro;50,000 on this exemption\u00a0is applied such that an electric vehicle with an original market value exceeding &euro;50,000 will be subject to BIK on the amount in excess of &euro;50,000. The cap will take effect from the 2019 tax year.<\/p><p>In examining value for money and tax equity considerations,\u00a0the\u00a0quantum of tax expenditure provided annually to qualifying taxpayers\u00a0in relation to the use of\u00a0high end cars must be taken in account.

Without the imposition of a &euro;50,000 cap, the tax expenditure on such a vehicle is the equivalent of an annual grant from the taxpayer to the employee or Director of up to &euro;23,400,\u00a0for a single tax year (i.e. the tax liability of the taxpayer would be reduced by up to this amount in a single tax year). This amount is equivalent to 7 or 8\u00a0home insulation grants to\u00a0low income households under the SEAI Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, where the benefit of these grants will last for many years. Or, that the same amount, under the National Fuel Allowance Scheme, is equivalent to an allowance for about 37 low income households for one year. <\/p><p>I am encouraged by the fact that registrations of new electric vehicles has doubled in the year to September and am\u00a0satisfied that the cap has been set at a reasonable level which maintains a strong incentive for the take-up of electric vehicles while having due regard for value for money and tax equity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prize Bonds","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG00900"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[43322\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the quantity of Ireland State Savings prize bonds prizes in a fiscal year has decreased while income for same has increased.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>I am answering this question on the basis of fiscal year 2017.\u00a0Under Prize Bonds the number of prizes is determined by a variable percentage rate applied to the value of Prize Bonds outstanding.\u00a0The variable percentage rate set to calculate the Prize Bond Fund was adjusted from 0.85% to 0.50% in August 2017.\u00a0 The interest rate reduction reflected changes across the retail savings market and the fall in the cost of borrowing by the State. \u00a0All changes in rates seek to maintain the balance of remaining competitive, providing good value for the holders of Prize Bonds while also remaining conscious of the cost to the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the decline in the variable percentage rate, the balance of savings in Prize Bonds increased by approximately &euro;0.3 billion to &euro;3.2 billion in 2017, which was\u00a0an increase of 10%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Reports","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG01200"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[43324\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners' tender for a report was completed (details supplied); if so, when the report was compiled and published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0that, following a submission by the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA) concerning the distinction between food supplements that the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0was prepared to accept as liable to VAT at the zero rate and those that are liable at the 23% rate, they undertook an in-depth review of the issue.

Pro-cyclical budgetary policies should be avoided; this is especially true when we are facing serious issues such as the exit of the UK from the European Union (and a non-negligible possibility of a 'disorderly' exit).\u00a0 <\/p><p>With this in mind, the more important framework for guiding fiscal policy is 'fiscal stance' - what is right for the economy at a particular point in time,\u00a0so as to support sustainable, incremental improvements in public services and living standards.<\/p><p>The correct 'fiscal\u00a0stance' can only be ascertained once account is taken of the position in the\u00a0economic cycle.\u00a0 If the economy is operating at full capacity, then it would be incorrect to adopt an expansionary budgetary policy. On the other hand, if there is spare capacity in the economy, then it may be appropriate to use tax and expenditure policy to help absorb the spare capacity.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Given the many issues facing the economy and the heightened level of uncertainty (such as what form the UK's exit from the EU will take), it is only possible to assess the appropriate fiscal stance on a year-to-year basis at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG03900"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[43517\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300070#WRG04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if under existing domestic and EU VAT law it is possible to apply different rates to different transactions under the same class of activity depending on the value of the business turnover or the value of the individual transaction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>I am advised by\u00a0the\u00a0Revenue Commissioners\u00a0that existing EU or national VAT law does not provide for VAT registered traders to apply different VAT rates to the same taxable supply based on business turnover or the value of an individual transaction. <\/p>  <p>  I would point out, however, that businesses with a low turnover have the option of remaining unregistered for VAT which means they can be exempt from VAT on any goods and services that they supply.

An important difference is that a payment account with basic features does not offer credit facilities, such as an overdraft.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, a payment account with basic features is free of charge for the first year for regular payment transactions in euro within the European Union.\u00a0 Where less than the equivalent of the national minimum wage is lodged to the account in a year, the account stays free of charge on a year-by-year basis for up to five years.\u00a0 After that, an account holder may be charged reasonable fees.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Regulation 16 of the European Union (Payment Accounts) Regulations 2016 permits a credit institution to refuse to open an account on one of two grounds.

The appeal was refused by the Appeals Board on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not warrant the allocation of an additional post under Circular 0010\/2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300073#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Eligibility","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300073#WRK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[43264\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300073#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an application by a school (details supplied) will be expedited; if the review committee is scheduled to meet to deal with pending appeals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has introduced an objective, statistics based model for assessing which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS Programme, so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.<\/p><p>There is no application process for DEIS and therefore no appeals process.  The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.<\/p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 provides for a verification process with which schools can engage to ensure the accuracy of the data being used.  It is envisaged that this process will involve a re-examination of the school data used and of the application of the data by the Department, to ensure that no administrative errors occurred. <\/p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie\/en\/Schools-Colleges\/Services\/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-\/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.<\/i><\/p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.<\/p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses.  Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  <\/p><p>Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, it has been decided to conduct further quality assurance on the model before extending these envisaged uses of the model.  Consequently, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300073#WRK01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Supply","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300073#WRK01500"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[43287\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300073#WRK01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the actions taken to make it easier for retired teachers to act as substitutes in the short-term but ensure this in no way interferes with the normal teaching labour market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>It is schools that employ teachers and not my Department.

Over the lifetime of the plan we will see 50,000\u00a0learners\u00a0register on\u00a0apprenticeship and traineeship programmes. This represents a more than doubling of activity by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  This\u00a0Government is\u00a0committed to doubling the number of people on an apprenticeship programme\u00a0by 2020 and expanding the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy. Arising from our two calls for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 and 2017 sixteen\u00a0new apprenticeships have now been developed in a\u00a0range of new occupations, including financial services, engineering, ICT, hospitality, logistics and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway later this year\u00a0and throughout 2019 in a\u00a0variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture.<\/p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships, as the employment and economic situation continues to improve, we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally\u00a0also with 4,508 new registrations in 2017, which represents a 20% increase on 2016. The upward trend\u00a0continues this year with 3,504 new\u00a0registrations recorded at the end of September, 7% ahead of the same period last year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is\u00a0also prioritising the expansion of traineeship offerings. To date over twenty additional new traineeships have been developed in areas such as hospitality, engineering, logistics and animation. These new programmes will complement the existing programmes on offer. The programmes have been designed by ETBs working in collaboration with employers to meet identified skill needs. Further new traineeships will get underway later this year\u00a0and throughout 2019 in a\u00a0variety of sectors including financial services, media and engineering.  We have also broadened the eligibility criteria on participation to include school leavers, older learners and people in employment.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in\u00a0the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, SOLAS is currently reviewing pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of underrepresented groups, including ethnic groups such as travellers.  The review will\u00a0identify any barriers that may exist\u00a0to participation in an apprenticeship programme. The purpose of the review is to ensure that our national apprenticeship system is more reflective of the range and diversity of our population,\u00a0more inclusive of diverse backgrounds and abilities and that apprenticeship opportunities are more readily accessible to all.  The review will result in the publication of actions in this area in the coming weeks, along with the background research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300074#WRL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":622,"content":"<p>Question No. 287 answered with Question No. 254.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Education","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300074#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[43715\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300074#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out the response from third-level institutions to the bursary scheme to increase the number of Travellers participating in third-level education; the number who were offered places through the scheme in 2016 and 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>The National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 (NAP) was launched in December 2015, and aims to ensure that the student body entering, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population.

To support the Commissioner in this recruitment, I have also secured funding in Budget 2019 which facilitates the recruitment of up to 800 more Garda&iacute; next year.\u00a0 The Budget also provides for\u00a0the necessary civilian Garda staff to fill critical skills gaps and enable the further redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line duties.<\/p>  <p>  As I said on Budget day, the Commissioner will need to consider all aspects of the funding requirement in the Garda Vote and how all resources at his disposal can be best deployed including in relation to the composition of the Service.\u00a0 I\u00a0expect to\u00a0receive his proposals in this regard shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the vision of 15,000 Garda members by 2021, plans are also in place for 4,000 civilians and 2,000 Reserves.

I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to increase, albeit more slowly than anticipated.\u00a0 It is clear, however,\u00a0that progress is being made with close to 300 new civilian staff posts sanctioned to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation.\u00a0 This will allow more Garda&iacute; to focus on operational policing duties where their training and specialist expertise can be put to best use.

In addition, under section 3 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, with effect from 31 July 2013, all applications for repossession in cases of mortgages created before 1 December 2009 on private residences or family homes must also be made in the Circuit Court.<\/p><p>As the figures above show, there has been a decline in the number of Possession Orders granted over the period concerned.

This equates to a drop of over 20% in the three year period. I might also add that the issue of a possession order does not, in many cases, lead to a loss of ownership of the family home and can be a catalyst for a solution between lender and homeowner which will see them retaining possession of the home. The introduction of the Abhaile Scheme, from 2016,\u00a0has provided help to over 10,000 households in serious mortgage arrears, most of whom are in the most serious category of arrears\u00a0(exceeding 720 days), and\u00a0has been a contributing factor to the decrease in Possession Orders being granted.<\/p><p><b>High Court:<\/b><\/p><p>The Courts Service has also indicated that High Court statistics in relation to the number of Possession Orders granted do not distinguish between Buy to Let and Private Dwelling.

I secured a\u00a0budgetary increase of\u00a0&euro;0.6 million\u00a0for 2019 and &euro;1 million has been redirected from a now discontinued project\u00a0and permanently attached to GSOC's annual budget.

I am awaiting a response from DPER to the proposal.<\/p><p>This Government has always been committed to ensuring that GSOC has the necessary supports and resources in order to fulfil its statutory functions and mandate.  This commitment is demonstrated\u00a0by allocating this extra funding\u00a0so that GSOC\u00a0will be able to maintain\u00a0the high standards it operates to.

Enterprise development has been central to our success in reducing national unemployment from a high of 16% to 5.4% at the end of September 2018\u00a0- the lowest level in over a decade. <\/p><p>The Border (Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan)\u00a0and West (Galway, Mayo, Roscommon)\u00a0regions have seen good progress, with employment in these regions increasing by 2.6% and 12.6% in total respectively\u00a0from Q1 2015 to Q2 2018, according to the CSO Labour Force Survey. <\/p><p>In 2017, Enterprise Ireland reported job increases in both the North West and West of 7% each; while IDA reported increases of 4% across the Border region and 5% in the West. Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon have 753 client companies employing 3,410 people; and last year those companies added 267 new jobs in total. <\/p><p>I am happy to say that in Budget 2019, I secured an increase in my Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m.<\/p><p>This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes:<\/p><p>- an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on this year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and<\/p><p>- an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.<\/p><p>Regional development was one of my three main priorities for Budget 2019 and I approved a range of measures to drive indigenous enterprise development and regional growth. <\/p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 LEOs, up 22% on 2018, which have a presence in every county, including Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal, to support start-ups and growth and in particular to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. The LEOs will work with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This will include a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, to be rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>The IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme is critical to encouraging more foreign direct investment into the regions. So, I was pleased to announce an allocation of &euro;10m to the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme. Project Ireland 2040 names the Border and Midlands regions as priority areas for this Programme, and so the funding will be used to start building advanced facilities in a number of regional locations. The next phase of the IDA Regional Property Programme will see new buildings constructed in a number of regional locations,\u00a0including in\u00a0Sligo.<b><\/b><\/p><p>IDA Ireland is working to promote Counties Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal to a range of potential investors, but especially in the areas of global business services, research and innovation and high-tech manufacturing. The IDA also regularly engages - with a view to encouraging job creation and investment - with key stakeholders on the ground in these counties, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base and from the indigenous sector. <\/p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises.<\/p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence. This new Scheme follows through on our commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. <\/p><p>In addition, I also secured funding for a new phase of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme out to 2024. The new scheme, which is worth &euro;175m, will be oriented towards seed and early stage investments, where there is a very clear market failure.<\/p><p>I announced an additional &euro;1.8m investment for the Design Craft Council of Ireland (DCCOI) which will assist craft enterprises all over the country to develop and generate additional export sales and online revenue opportunities, increased market diversification so as to underpin sustainable growth. <\/p><p>Finally, I announced a &euro;300m Brexit Future Growth Longer Term Loan Scheme for loans of up to 10 years. The Scheme has been developed by my Department with the European Investment Bank Group, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Finance together with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. <\/p><p>This Scheme will provide businesses the opportunity to borrow for up to ten years to support capital investment.

I would like to assure the Deputy that Sl&aacute;intecare implementation is a key priority for me and the Government.<\/p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy was published in August.

The Implementation Strategy contains 106 linked actions to be delivered over the first 3 years of implementation.\u00a0<\/p><p>In tandem, a dedicated Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office has been established in the Department of Health.

Communication and consultation was identified as a critical requirement in implementation by the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.<\/p><p>A number of specific actions in the Implementation Strategy are already under way. The independent review of the impacts of the removal of private practice from public hospitals is ongoing and expected to report before the end of 2018.<\/p><p>Renegotiation of the GP contract has commenced with GP representatives on a package of measures including service improvements and reforms to the GMS contract.<\/p><p>Government approval has been secured for the establishment of an independent board for the HSE.

Almost two-thirds of required residential placements (65.5%) are for individuals who require supports to be delivered at high support staffing levels and frequently at 1:1 or above.\u00a0 The majority of new placements are commissioned from private providers as there is minimal capacity available in the public system.<\/p><p><b>- State Claims Agency:<\/b>An actuarial assessment for potential claims under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme is prepared annually by the State Claims Agency and a determination is taken with regard to the level of funding that will be required by year end.As the year end position is an estimate it can come in under or over budget.\u00a0 In the last few years it has come in over budget, this is typically due to settlement of cases prior to the courts closing at year end.\u00a0 The increasing cost of settlements is determined by the court system and not within the remit of the health system.<\/p><p><b>- Drugs:\u00a0<\/b>The main drivers behind this is the expenditure on new High Tech drugs, in areas such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatology, and cancer drugs, increased spend on drugs on the Long Term Illness scheme e.g. diabetes, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy and General Medical Services Drugs &amp;amp; Pharmacy costs.<\/p><p><b>Pensions:\u00a0<\/b>Health is one of the few public services which has its pension costs reflected in its Vote; changes to pension rates, and the fact that pensioners are living longer hasresulted in a significant increase in the share of the health vote which is attributable to pensions.<\/p><p><b>- Pay<\/b>: The growth in both staff numbers, pay rate premia and underlying pay costs linked to Workplace Relations Commission agreements.<\/p><p>It is important to note that growth in health expenditure is a feature of all health systems and is not unique to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300083#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Supply","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300083#WRU02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1071,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[43664\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300083#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a required medical product will be supplied to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1072,"content":"<p>Medicines play a vital role in improving the health of Irish patients.

The implementation of these measures will depend on the outcome of the negotiations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a range of measures to deal with the short-term impacts of Brexit.  In terms of dealing with Competitiveness issues, my Department introduced a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes in the 2017 Budget.  In Budget 2018, I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise\u00a0and Innovation, introduced a new &euro;300m &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; to provide affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future - at least 40% of which will be available to seafood businesses.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have followed\u00a0up these measures with further initiatives as part of\u00a0Budget 2019, which contains\u00a0a &euro;78 million Brexit package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs in my Department.  &euro;7 million has also been provided to support Brexit preparedness work within my Department, namely, to meet the staffing and IT costs associated with the additional import control and export certification requirements arising from Brexit.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-coordinated \u00a0&lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to Brexit, my Department is planning for an orderly Brexit which involves, inter alia, a transition period.  It is very welcome that the European Council has proposed that the whole of the EU\u00a0acquis - including the Common Fisheries Policy -\u00a0will apply to the UK during the transition.<\/p>  <p>  Our enterprise agencies are continuing to work with seafood companies to help them to deal with Brexit through making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, I have continued to have positive, regular meetings with my European colleagues, especially those from the group of 8 Coastal Member States whose fisheries are potentially most impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  I am also working closely with key stakeholders in the Irish fishing industry and am pleased at the level of unity on these key issues.  The results of my engagement with the Barnier Task Force, in close collaboration with the T&aacute;naiste are evident in the agreed EU position on fisheries.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My priority has been, and remains, to maintain existing levels of access to waters and resources.

The Plan provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <\/p>  <p>  In January of this year the government published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework which represents our national policy response to the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change. Seven Government Departments, with responsibility for twelve priority sectors, are currently preparing sectoral adaptation plans for submission to Government for approval by 30 September 2019 in line with the requirements of the Climate Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan (NDP) will be on climate action and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with other relevant Departments and Agencies on the preparation of a National Energy and Climate Plan. This work has, in turn, been informed by work undertaken to prepare the Energy White Paper, the National Mitigation Plan, National Adaptation Framework and National Development Plan. An initial consultation on the preparation of Ireland's draft National Energy and Climate Plan is taking place from 9 October until 12 November. I intend that the draft Plan, once completed, will be the subject of a separate public consultation.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Climate Act 2015, the Government must also prepare and submit to the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement. In support of this written Statement I, as well as other relevant Ministers, intend to provide an oral report to each House. This process ensures that responsible Ministers are directly accountable to the Oireachtas to ensure real progress is made in reducing emissions in their respective sectors. I expect to be in position to lay the 2018 Annual Transition Statement before the Oireachtas shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300088#WRZ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1320,"content":"<p>Question No. 527 answered with Question No. 521.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Metropolitan Area Networks Programme","counter":1321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300088#WRZ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1322,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[43357\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300088#WRZ00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will release the pricing review of the metropolitan area networks; if not, the reason; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1323,"content":"<p>As stated in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 42146 of 16 October, 2018,  the Department is engaging with the Management Services Entity (enet) in relation to the implementation of the recommendations of the Review and the Review will be published shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300088#WRZ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":1324,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300088#WRZ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1325,"qnumday":529,"qnumall":"[43358\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300088#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of freedom of information requests his Department has received regarding a concession agreement with a company (details supplied); the number granted; the number refused; the number granted following the intervention of the Office of the Information Commissioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1326,"content":"<p>My Department received eleven FOI requests in relation to the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and to the Concession Agreement with enet who manage the MANs on behalf of the State, in the period from 1 January 2012 to 16 October 2018.  <\/p><p>Of these, four requests were part-granted and five were refused, as provided for within the exemption provisions of the FOI Act.

Research indicates that rental properties are twice as likely to be E, F or G rated on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scale. However, rental properties present a particular challenge in terms of energy efficiency upgrades owing to the split incentive issue.  A split incentive occurs where landlords meet the cost of improvements, while tenants would reap the benefit, so neither party is motivated to upgrade the dwelling. This is why there is currently under-investment in improving the energy performance of rental properties. <\/p>  <p>  Grants for energy efficiency, funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), are already available to landlords. Improving the energy efficiency of rental properties will deliver multiple benefits, including improved living conditions and health outcomes, enhanced asset value and reduced energy bills. However, in identifying the appropriate policy interventions the priority has also been to ensure that the approach taken to address energy poverty will  also not adversely impact the housing supply situation. <\/p>  <p>  To find a way forward that supports action in the two critical policy areas of energy poverty and housing supply, options for improving energy efficiency in the rental sector will be consulted on as part of the new Long Term Renovation Strategy.

The\u00a0new compliance scheme provides the assurance to drivers and\u00a0consumers that their old tyres will be disposed of responsibly by the retailer when they buy new tyres. <\/p><p>At that time, the Minister also indicated that he would look at the issue of old tyres on farms and &euro;700,000 was recently allocated to remove tyres from farms. Irish Farm Film Producers Group (IFFPG), the national farm plastics recycling compliance scheme, agreed to undertake the removal of tyres from farms through 4 bring centres around the country. The collections, which were chosen because they represent a good geographical spread, took place as follows:\u00a0<\/p><p>- Cootehill Mart, Co. Cavan (29 September)<\/p><p>- New Ross Mart, Co. Wexford\u00a0(9 October)<\/p><p>- Athenry Mart, Co Galway\u00a0(13th October) and<\/p><p>- Gort Drum Mines, Monard, Co. Tipperary\u00a0(20th October)<\/p><p>In total, approximately 4,253 tonnes of tyres were collected from these bring centres and the &euro;700,000 budget was fully expended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300089#WRAA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Waste Disposal","counter":1371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300089#WRAA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1372,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[43665\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300089#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will reallocate the unspent funds that were  to be used for the 2018 farm hazardous waste collection centres to support the completion of the nationwide collection and recycling of farm tyre waste.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1373,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[43666\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300089#WRAA01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to ensure that the farm hazardous waste collection centres will resume in 2019 in view of their success in the collection and recycling of hazardous waste on farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1374,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 546 and 547 together.  <\/p>  <p>  From 2013 to 2017 inclusive, the EPA carried out annual farm hazardous waste collections as a pilot scheme.\u00a0The aim of this pilot scheme was to ascertain the types and volumes of waste on farms which needed to be disposed of safely.\u00a0 During the pilot, over 1,000 tonnes of hazardous waste including pesticides, veterinary products, waste oil, contaminated containers, paint, WEEE and batteries has been collected and disposed of safely.<\/p>  <p>  I expect the EPA to publish their findings in relation this pilot scheme shortly.\u00a0 However, I have received a draft of same and the range and quantity of hazardous waste removed convinces me that there is an absolute necessity for such collections in order to provide an outlet for farmers to dispose of these wastes safely.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  One of the main recommendations by the EPA is that a national scheme be developed to collect these hazardous wastes.\u00a0My Department is currently exploring with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other stakeholders how this might be developed and funded.<\/p>  <p>  The pilot study was primarily funded through the National Waste Prevention Programme with a contribution from other stakeholders and farmers.\u00a0 As the Deputy is aware, however, I made separate funding of &euro;700,000 available this year for the collection of waste tyres from farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300089#WRAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":1375,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300089#WRAA01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1376,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[43725\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300089#WRAA01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the categories of funding available to local authorities through his Department; the amount of funding provided for each scheme in 2016 and 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1377,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding through\u00a0a number of schemes to local authorities, the details of which are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>Categories of funding available to local authorities<\/th><th>Amount of funding provided \u00a0(&euro; inc.

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality.<\/p><p>Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality.\u00a0 For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011.

Ireland currently has a nationwide network of 33 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones.

criteria for the fuel allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1549,"content":"<p>The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;630 each year) from October to April, to over 368,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;227 million in 2018.\u00a0 The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.\u00a0 The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.\u00a0 It is not intended to meet those costs in full.\u00a0 Only one allowance is paid per household. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the house hold benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;182 million in 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.\u00a0 Therefore the fuel allowance is a means tested payment and qualifying payments are those payments that are considered long term payments by my Department.\u00a0 People on long term payments are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to energy poverty than people who have only recently become unemployed, and may only be jobless for a short period.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance scheme to include people on short term payment schemes would require considerable extra funding for the scheme and would have to be considered in the overall budgetary negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  With regards to no right of appeal the fuel allowance scheme is administrative (non-statutory) and therefore decisions on claims cannot be appealed to a Social Welfare Appeals Officer.\u00a0 However, if a customer is dissatisfied with a decision not to grant an allowance, s\/he may request a review of his\/her claim by a different Deciding Officer.\u00a0 It is open to applicants to supply any additional facts of information in support of his\/her application.\u00a0 However, if it is the case that they are simply not qualified for payment, a review will not overturn the previous decision.\u00a0 If following this review, the applicant still does not qualify for the allowance it is still open to them to contact the Office of the Ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a recipient of a social welfare or health service executive payment who has exceptional essential heating costs due to ill health or infirmity and who cannot provide for such costs from within his or her own resources may qualify for a heating supplement.\u00a0 There is no standard rate for a heating supplement.\u00a0 Each case is examined on its merits and the Community Welfare Officer determines the amount to be paid taking account of the level of the expenses in question and the ability of the applicant to contribute towards his or her exceptional heating costs.<\/p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.\u00a0 My Department works with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.\u00a0 In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the

which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.\u00a0  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.\u00a0  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.<\/p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 ratebands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a yearly average of only 20 contributions per year, out of a maximum of 52,\u00a0could attract a 98% pension.\u00a0  The effect of the 2012 rate band changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last six years, and it is to mitigate that impact that this reform was always explicitly intended to achieve.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.\u00a0 There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.\u00a0 This in turn\u00a0would significantly impact\u00a0upon the funds available\u00a0for future pension rate increases, with consequential implications for\u00a0pensioner poverty.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It would also mean that, in being able to choose between TCA and the pre-2012 ratebands, those pensioners would, again, have a more advantageous contributory pension regime than those who reached pension age after 2012, and whose choice is between TCA and the post-2012 ratebands.\u00a0 This would be a less fairer approach than the one being adopted by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;232, over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension, and 70% qualify for this pension at the full rate.\u00a0 This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.\u00a0 Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an increase for a qualified adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300093#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Reform","counter":1581,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300093#WREE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1582,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[43238\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300093#WREE01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the changes which have been implemented for the payment of illness benefit;

This scheme was launched on 1 February 2018 following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan.<\/p><p>The loan enables credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate. <\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is targeted at first-time buyers who wish to own their own home, have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home. As with the previous local authority loan offerings, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first-time buyers only.  This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources.<\/p><p>Full details of the loan&rsquo;s eligibility criteria and other information are available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>In addition to this, work is on-going towards increasing the availability of affordable housing in the areas of the country most affected by a lack of affordable housing supply. The Government has committed &euro;310 million to support this programme of work, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), as part of Budget 2019.  In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p><p>Once the funding is awarded and the infrastructure is provided I expect delivery of affordable homes from 2019 onwards. Separately, all local authorities will now carry out an economic assessment of the requirement for affordable housing in their area, and the authorities&rsquo; capacity to deliver housing at affordable prices from their sites. Based on this analysis further local authorities may be considered for funding under the SSF.<\/p><p>I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis some 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated.  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out more generally. Under the 2009 Act, the maximum discount is 40% of the market value of the home and the local authority takes a charge, equivalent to the discount, against the property, which the household must recoup at re-sale or during the charge period. The funding repaid by the purchaser is paid into a new Affordable Dwellings Fund which can then be used to fund more affordable housing. The scheme applies to new homes, and is targeted at single applicants earning up to &euro;50,000 per annum or &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300096#WRHH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1786,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1787,"qnumday":686,"qnumall":"[43396\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of engagements, meetings or correspondence that he has had with a person (details supplied) in the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1788,"content":"<p>I have had no\u00a0engagements, meetings or correspondence with the person concerned during my tenure as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Applications","counter":1789,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1790,"qnumday":687,"qnumall":"[43409\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a HAP arrears payment will issue for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1791,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State. <\/p><p>HAP is a form of social housing support under which local authorities make monthly payments on behalf of tenants directly to landlords in respect of rent, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.

In the first instance, it is a matter for local authorities to bring forward viable and appropriate development proposals. Of course, it is also\u00a0a matter for each local authority to manage its own finances in a prudent and sustainable manner. \u00a0In this context,\u00a0I understand the Housing Finance\u00a0Agency works with individual\u00a0local authorities to find the most efficient way of dealing with\u00a0each authority's outstanding\u00a0loans. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Land Aggregation Scheme\u00a0was introduced in 2010 to assist in the gradual unwinding of loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme\u00a0where\u00a0loans\u00a0were due to mature and where it\u00a0was considered unlikely that land would be developed in the short to medium term. <\/p>  <p>  An initial appraisal of the sites submitted by local authorities was carried out by the Housing Agency, as well as a due diligence assessment.\u00a0 Applications to the value of some &euro;163 million in loans were accepted into the\u00a0Land Aggregation Scheme.\u00a0&euro;111 million\u00a0of loans\u00a0were fully redeemed\u00a0and the remaining &euro;52 million\u00a0are being recouped\u00a0in the form of annuity loans. I understand that the site at Mount Avenue was accepted under the annuity arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities were advised of the discontinuance of the Scheme, in respect of new applications, in 2013.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, my Department is committed to\u00a0supporting local authorities\u00a0to realise new social and affordable homes from their lands without delay.\u00a0 Sites that are not suited for a full social housing development may be more suited to a mixed-tenure development including social, affordable and perhaps private housing. <\/p>  <p>  There is funding available to support local authorities in terms of the delivery of social and affordable housing from their own lands.\u00a0Next year, &euro;2.4 billion\u00a0will be invested\u00a0in housing\u00a0and over\u00a0the four years to the end of 2019, &euro;6.6 billion will have been provided.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important that local authorities\u00a0identify the most appropriate development proposals for each site, taking all of the available funding into account. For example, I understand that the site at Mount Avenue\u00a0was\u00a0approved for\u00a0funding of &euro;3.3m under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund\u00a0(LIHAF) for the provision of an access road\u00a0which will support the initial development of 200 homes, with a potential for up to 1,200 homes on the wider lands.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities further to\u00a0prepare their\u00a0sites  for affordable housing specifically, the Government\u00a0recently committed under Budget 2019 to provide &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). A first call for proposals under the Fund issued to local authorities in Dublin; the Greater Dublin Area (including Louth); Cork and Galway in June 2018, with\u00a0a closing date for applications of end August.\u00a0\u00a0Fifteen proposals were received from\u00a0nine local authorities under this first call and\u00a0are currently being assessed.\u00a0\u00a0I expect this assessment process to be finalised and an announcement of the first successful bids to be made in the coming weeks.\u00a0 While Louth County Council did not make an application under the first call, further calls for proposals will be made and it will be open to the Council to submit applications at that stage if it considers it appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Services Provision","counter":1812,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1813,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[43697\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1814,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the provision of emergency medical services, including pre-hospital emergency care, rests with the Health Service Executive (HSE) which operates the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and emergency departments in hospitals in accordance with health sector legislation and national policy. The HSE operates under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister with policy and legislative responsibility for fire safety and the provision of fire services by local authorities, my primary concern, as set out in the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, is that local authority provided fire services are meeting their statutory obligations in respect of provision of fire services and fire safety. These responsibilities include the important activity of community and other fire safety initiatives as well as response to 999\/112 calls. <\/p>  <p>  In general, there is a high degree of collaboration and co-ordination of emergency activity among the Principal Emergency Services. In some circumstances, the HSE&rsquo;s NAS calls for assistance from fire services in responding to certain categories of 999\/112 emergency calls. Such calls are typically in respect of, but not limited to, ECHO (life threatening) emergencies. As well as being able to call on Community First Responders, the NAS is aware that many fire services are equipped with automatic external defibrillators and have trained their fire-fighters in Cardiac First Responder and Emergency First Responder to Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council standards. Fire services are so equipped and trained in the first instance\u00a0to ensure\u00a0the health and safety of their own staff, but can also use their skills and equipment where they encounter casualties at emergency incidents. <\/p>  <p>  Fire services generally respond to calls for assistance from external bodies in accordance with protocols operated within the three fire services Regional Communications Centres. <\/p>  <p>  The feasibility of fire services (outside of the Dublin Fire Brigade area of operations) being commissioned by the HSE to provide a response service in support of the NAS in responding to ECHO emergency calls was discussed at national level at the Fire Services National Oversight &amp;amp; Implementation Group (FSNOIG), which consists of fire service management and staff representatives. FSNOIG produced a discussion document which could potentially be used as the basis to underpin discussions with the Health sector. The document was discussed at the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management meeting of 18 July 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposal for formalising such assistance needs to be subject to appropriate governance, cost reimbursement arrangements and to be set in the context of a service agreement with the HSE\/NAS which will not impact on or adversely affect fire services' primary roles. It would be important in such circumstances to ensure that local authority and fire services' resources are not diverted from their statutory fire service and fire safety responsibilities, where they are providing assistance for another public body. The potential impact on the current Community First Responders schemes would also have to be assessed.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As responsibility for the provision of emergency medical services, including pre-hospital emergency care, rests with the HSE, it would be more appropriate to\u00a0engage with my colleague the Minister for Health in the first instance to advance proposals in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":1815,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1816,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[43712\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102300097#WRJJ03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his Department has a contingency plan to mitigate the effects of Brexit; if so, if he will publish same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1817,"content":"<p>Planning for the U.K.'s exit from the European Union was initiated over two years ago and preparedness for different types of Brexit is well underway across Government.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being taken forward through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople.

I have allocated &euro;1.3m for the Structures at Risk Fund nationally in 2018. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, a total of &euro;119,000 was allocated to 5 projects in County Kildare under this scheme.
