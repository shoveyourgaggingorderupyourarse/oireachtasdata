This meeting is a continuation of the committee's engagement on the Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement, CETA.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Dr. David Fennelly, Dr. Oisin Suttle and Dr. Laurens Ankersmit to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.<\/p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, that is, outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity against legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  I now invite Dr. Ankersmit to make his opening statement.

I sent the committee a short position paper, which I hope it has received.<\/p><p>I will briefly outline three key points on this position paper.  CETA is currently in the process of ratification across member states and there are several member states still very critical of the agreement's ratification, including the country I am from, the Netherlands, whose senate still needs to approve CETA and where there is currently no majority for it.<\/p><p> CETA, particularly the changes made to the investment chapter in the agreement, is often presented as progressive and an agreement that has accommodated certain changes and criticisms that have been addressed.  I have three points that criticise this description of CETA, and particularly the changes in the investment chapter, as a progressive agreement.<\/p><p> The investment court system, ICS, maintains this extraordinarily powerful judicial system that allows foreign investors to bring claims against governments directly without exhausting domestic remedies.  Not only are foreign investors not required to go to domestic courts first, which is customary in international law, but they can go directly to the investment court system.  They can also enforce awards from the investment courts system in front of any courts in the world through this convention or system set up through CETA.  It is an extraordinarily powerful tool that foreign investors have and which is maintained in CETA.  That foreign investors can sidestep domestic courts gives foreign investors an important tool to pressure governments because they are not required to go through domestic courts, which may be in a better position to value and appreciate the local context and constitutional matters, as well as issues of domestic law that may be present in a dispute between a foreign investor and government.<\/p><p> Related to this first point is the issue that national parliaments are not in the position to easily change the text on which the ICS tribunals would be ruling.  Normally, for Irish courts, for example, they would rule on statutes or other provisions of law made by the Irish Parliament and parliaments can change those relatively quickly.  With CETA, the text would not be so easily amended.  If it is difficult to ratify the agreement, it is even more difficult to amend it, as we would have to go through the same process.  The interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard can be done through the CETA joint committee, for example, but it is very difficult to achieve such a joint interpretation and there is still the question of whether the ICS tribunals would abide by the joint interpretation issued by the CETA joint committee.<\/p><p> A second indication that the agreement is not that progressive at all is that all investments are protected under the investment chapter.  Despite the fact that 80% of coal reserves, half of gas reserves and a third of the oil reserves in the world need to stay in the ground - we need to stop investing in fossil fuels - CETA is encouraging foreign investors to invest in fossil fuels.  This is important as the safeguards introduced in CETA will continue past practice under investor-state dispute settlement systems.  All the safeguards introduced are there merely to continue the process.  The language speaks of \"greater certainty\" and clarification but the past practices are continued through arbitration.  A quarter of all disputes before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, World Bank investment system come from the oil, gas and mining industry.<\/p><p>The success rate in general of these investment disputes is 28.7%.  That is a gigantic win percentage for investors.  To compare that to the European Court of Justice, if one sues the EU institutions for damages, one's chances of success are 4.3%, so one's chance under the ICSID system is five times higher.<\/p><p> In terms of balance, the ICS is a step backwards compared to the modest steps that are being made in investment law to allow for counterclaims and for claims from third parties and to give affected communities an effective say in disputes that involve foreign investors, affected communities and states.  The ICS is only an avenue for foreign investors.  Only foreign investors can bring claims.  Parties themselves cannot bring counterclaims and there is no possibility for local communities to bring claims against foreign investors under the ICS system.<\/p><p> The system is not as progressive as presented, for instance, by Vice-President Frans Timmermans or a previous trade Commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m.  In light of the relatively high standard of judicial protection we have in Europe and in Canada, there is no need to ratify CETA for that reason.  If members have any questions, I am happy to answer them.  I thank members for their time and consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laurens Ankersmit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ankersmit for keeping his contribution brief.

The committee has asked me to address two points in evidence.  The first is the ratification of CETA and its compatibility with the Constitution, with particular regard to the well-known Crotty case.  The second relates to the implications of ratification and non-ratification.<\/p> <p>  Before I address those issues, I should probably start with two caveats.  The first is that my evidence is concerned solely with the legal dimension of these issues.  As we have just heard, there are important political dimensions to those issues.  In my evidence I am not concerned with the merits or demerits of CETA or its ratification by the State.  Second, as proceedings have been issued in the High Court raising the issue of whether CETA can be ratified by Parliament or must be put to the people in a constitutional referendum, some caution is warranted in addressing these issues in this forum.  It is of course ultimately a matter for the courts to determine whether ratification of CETA is compatible with the Constitution, so the purpose of my evidence and the briefing paper I furnished to the committee is to assist it by outlining the legal principles that are relevant to its consideration of these important issues.<\/p> <p>  It is probably appropriate to address the first issue, the compatibility of ratification of CETA with the Constitution, in three steps.  First, it may be helpful to outline the framework within which Ireland's international relations are conducted under the Constitution.  Second, I will look at the case law: the Crotty case and a later case known as Pringle, that address the principles of when we need a referendum in order to ratify a treaty.  Finally, I will look to CETA briefly to assess how it fits within this scheme.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at the constitutional scheme first.  The important point to note is that under Articles 28 and 29 of the Constitution, it is for the Government to conduct the foreign affairs of the State.  In conducting the State's foreign affairs, the Government has a very wide discretion.  Second, Parliament does have a very important oversight role when it comes to foreign affairs, particularly in the context of treaty making.  We see this in Articles 29.5 and 29.6 of the Constitution.  All international agreements to which the State is party must be laid before the D&aacute;il.  Any agreement involving a charge on public funds must be approved by the D&aacute;il, and where there is a change of law necessitated by an international agreement, this must be conducted by the Oireachtas in accordance with its law-making power under Article 15.<\/p><p>In this way, the Parliament exercises an important role and today's meeting and the other meetings on CETA are important examples of this power being exercised in practice.<\/p><p> When it comes to the people, when is it necessary to consult the people on a particular international agreement?  To date, it has only been in exceptional cases that international treaties have been put to the people.  There have been eight international agreements put to the people by way of referendum.  Some six of those international agreements concerned the European Union, our original accession to the European communities and the major revisions of the treaties that have followed in later decades.  The other two are the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of 2001.  It is pretty exceptional, therefore, for international treaties to be put to the people.<\/p><p> It is important to note that our international relations are increasingly being conducted within the framework of the European Union.  More power has been transferred to the European Union in the field of foreign affairs and CETA is a good example of this.  The recent EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement is another vivid example.  Unlike the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, which has been concluded as an EU-only agreement, CETA is a mixed agreement and therefore member states and this Parliament have their say in determining whether or not they should ratify this particular agreement.  That is important by way of context.<\/p><p> When is a referendum required before the State can ratify or conclude an international agreement?  The starting point here is the Supreme Court's judgment in the Crotty case.  Members may be familiar with this case, which was concerned with Ireland's ratification of the first major revision of the European treaties, the Single European Act.  That was a treaty of two parts.  Title 2 of the Single European Act concerned revisions of the existing treaties and title 3 concerned European political co-operation and putting structured co-operation among member states in the field of foreign policy on a formal treaty footing.  Mr. Raymond Crotty challenged the Government's ratification of this agreement before the courts, ultimately ending up in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court's judgment is also of two parts.  In the first part the court upheld Ireland's ratification and implementation of title 2 of the Single European Act, that is, the amendments to the existing treaties.  According to the Supreme Court, this did not go beyond the essential scope and objectives of the original amendment to the Constitution in 1972 and therefore was permissible without referendum.  Second, when it came to title 3 of the Single European Act, that is, the part dealing with structured foreign policy co-operation, the Supreme Court held, by a majority of three to two, that this part of the Single European Act involved the alienation or fettering of powers conferred under the Constitution on the Government in the field of foreign affairs.  Because it involved this alienation of sovereign powers of the Government under the Constitution, it had to be put to the people by way of referendum before the State could ratify this particular international agreement.  Thereafter, a referendum was duly passed and Ireland ratified the Single European Act.<\/p><p> In two subsequent judgments, the Supreme Court has significantly qualified the scope of its Crotty ruling.  First, in the McGimpsey case in 1990, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to Ireland's ratification of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the court ruled that there was vast difference between that agreement, which involved establishing a forum for co-operation between the two states, and title 3 of the Single European Act.  Second and more significant for our purposes, in the Supreme Court's more recent judgment in the Pringle case, the Supreme Court rejected by a majority of six to one a challenge by a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to the State's ratification of the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  Members may recall that this treaty established the mechanisms to provide financial assistance to eurozone member states during the economic crisis.  Under that system, states had to contribute in a significant way and were exposed to significant liability once they signed up to this mechanism.  Deputy Pringle challenged this before the Irish and European courts.<\/p><p>The Supreme Court, in considering this issue, had to determine whether the ESM treaty involves such a substantial transfer of power to this new institution that it required an amendment and, in fairly trenchant terms, the Supreme Court decided that no referendum was required.  According to a number of members of the court, ratification of the ESM treaty involved the exercise of sovereignty, not its alienation or abdication.  It is that language of alienation, abdication of sovereignty and subordination of sovereign powers that is the feature of the Pringle judgment and sets the test now for when an international agreement must be approved by the people by way of a referendum before it can be ratified.  The Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Denham, said that if a treaty involves a fundamental transformation - a ceding of sovereignty - then it would require the mandate of the people.<\/p><p> What do we take from these judgments, and in particular this most recent judgment in the Pringle case?  Essentially, we see a narrowing of the court's earlier judgment in the Crotty case.  The court maintains the principle that if there is an alienation or abdication of the State's sovereign powers, then there must be a referendum.  However, it has set a very high threshold for when it will intervene and, by extension, for when treaties must be put to the people by way of referendum.  One former member of the Supreme Court has described the Pringle judgment as putting the earlier Crotty judgment to sleep.<\/p><p> What the Pringle judgment certainly signals is that in the ordinary course treaties entered into by the State will be considered to be the exercise rather than the alienation of sovereignty.  It is only when they involve a very significant and open-ended transfer of power to an international institution or a grouping of states that a referendum will be required.  In doing so the Supreme Court affirms not only the role of governments in conducting foreign relations but also the pre-eminent role of the Parliament in the scrutiny of international agreements.  The Pringle judgment reduces but does not eliminate the uncertainty around when an international agreement may require to be put to the people.  Ultimately, that question has to be answered by reference to the terms of the particular agreement.<\/p><p> Third, what does this mean for CETA?  We would need to carry out a very close and detailed examination of the agreement to assess that question but what we can say is that in its treaty-making practice to date the State has frequently signed up to international agreements that set up mechanisms of international dispute settlement.  The European Court of Human Rights is one example.  There are various mechanisms under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; the World Trade Organization Agreement, which is signed up to by the member states but also by the EU; the Aarhus convention and, in the context of investor protection, the Energy Charter Treaty.  None of those have been put to the people by way of a referendum.<\/p><p> In two cases, the State has put or proposed to put international agreements involving such mechanisms to the people.  The first is the International Criminal Court referendum, which I have referred to, and the second is the commitment given to put the Unified Patent Court to a referendum when Ireland proposes to accede to it.  I can deal with the detail of those or any questions about those if members have questions.<\/p><p> Turning to CETA specifically, Dr. Ankersmit set out certain important features of the agreement's tribunal system.  As I said, this matter is currently pending before the courts so I will be circumspect in my comments on it but a helpful reference point for the members in considering this is the assessment by the Court of Justice of the CETA tribunal system in its opinion 1\/17.  In that opinion, the court emphasises certain important features of the CETA tribunal system, which may be of relevance when the Irish courts come to consider this issue.  <\/p><p> The reference point for the Irish courts will be the Constitution as opposed to the EU treaties but analogous issues are likely to arise insofar as the Constitution is concerned.  First, the jurisdiction of the CETA tribunals is limited to claims for loss or damage or for breach of the obligations under chapter eight of the CETA agreement.  Second, Article 8.9 of CETA expressly recognises the right of parties to regulate, including in pursuing legitimate policy objectives, for example, in the field of the environment.  There is controversy about whether that goes far enough.  I simply point to it as an example and a feature of the system.  Third, and this is important when it comes to the assessment of our constitutional framework, the tribunals have no jurisdiction to determine the legality of measures of domestic or European law and any interpretation given by them of domestic law will not be binding on the courts of the EU, Canada or the EU's member states.<\/p><p>These are important features of the CETA system.  There are others such as the enforcement of the awards, which is given effect under the New York convention and the ICSID convention regimes, which Ireland is party to.<\/p><p> Under Article 30.6 of CETA, the provisions of the agreement do not create rights or impose obligations that can be directly invoked in the domestic legal systems.  A party cannot provide for a right of action in the domestic courts for breach of the provisions of the treaty.  This goes back to a point made by Dr. Ankersmit.  She mentioned that there is certainly no requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, but investors could nonetheless take action under domestic law, and particularly under domestic constitutional law in the Irish context, if they felt aggrieved, as an alternative to taking their dispute to the CETA tribunal.  I emphasise I am not taking a view on whether the CETA tribunals involve such a significant or open-ended transfer of power to those bodies that they would require a constitutional referendum, an issue that is live before the Irish courts.  Nevertheless, those elements of the regime would certainly be taken into account, alongside some of the elements I referred to earlier, in assessing whether the treaty must be put to the people by way of referendum or whether it is sufficient for the Oireachtas as Parliament, and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in particular, to approve its terms.<\/p><p> The issue of the implications of ratification versus non-ratification is more straightforward.  If CETA is ratified, whether by parliamentary approval or a vote of the people if that is deemed to be required, the Government will be in a position to proceed to ratify the agreement on behalf of the State.  Assuming all the other member states had completed their domestic ratification processes, and we have heard that that process is ongoing, CETA could be concluded by the EU and its member states and come into force for them.  At the moment, CETA is being only provisionally applied in certain areas within the exclusive competence of the Union.<\/p><p> The second, trickier issue relates to non-ratification.  If the D&aacute;il did not approve the terms of CETA or it was put to a referendum and the people rejected it, what would be the position then?  Traditionally, the practice of the Union in agreements of this kind has been to await the outcome of the domestic ratification processes before concluding the agreement on behalf of the EU.  If one or more of the member states were not in a position to ratify CETA, the agreement could not be concluded in accordance with Article 30.7 of CETA, at least in its current form.  Obviously, Ireland could not be compelled to ratify an agreement contrary to its domestic constitutional procedures but the member states would be under a duty of sincere co-operation with the Union in the context of agreements of this kind and the untangling of those agreements.  This arises under Article 4.3 of the Treaty on European Union, TEU, and under the case law of the European Courts of Justice.  There may be an obligation on member states to engage at least with the Union institutions in teasing out the implications and outcomes arising from non-ratification.  Ultimately, of course, these matters would have to be resolved at the political level, whether by amendment to the treaties or otherwise, which would not be a straightforward process, as we have heard.<\/p><p> I welcome any questions from members.  I refer them to my briefing document for further detail on the various points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Fennelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fennelly for the comprehensive legal overview.

Members should have received a short written submission from me, so I will keep my remarks brief and provide an overview of it.<\/p> <p>  CETA's investor court system is an example of investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, a mechanism allowing foreign investors to sue host governments in international tribunals outside of national court systems.  By way of introduction, it might be useful to give some context about ISDS.  It is a common remedy in bilateral investment treaties, of which almost 3,000 are in existence.  It is, however, highly unusual in international law in general.  Most international law rights, such as those of the World Trade Organization, are enforced between states.  ISDS, on the other hand, gives investors themselves the right to sue under investment treaties without recourse to their home governments in the first instance.<\/p><p>The rights that investors can invoke vary, depending on the treaty, but generally include non-discrimination, compensation for direct or indirect expropriation and a guarantee of fair and equitable treatment.  In the past 20 years in particular, investors have regularly invoked these rights to challenge measures by host states.  We are not quite sure how often they have done so because many of these things are confidential but there are over 1,000 known claims and possibly many more that remained confidential.  These frequently result in eye-watering damages awards.  The average ISDS award over the past ten years is over $250 million and there have been 14 known awards where damages have exceeded $1 billion so potentially huge sums are at stake.<\/p><p> Ireland has largely avoided ISDS until now.  With the exception of the energy charter treaty, Ireland has no bilateral investment treaties, BITs.  This compares with a state like Germany, which has 127 in force while the UK has 102 and France has somewhere in the high nineties.  BITs and ISDS are usually advocated as tools to help countries - especially developing countries - to attract foreign investment.  That Ireland has been successful in recent decades in attracting investment without the use of these treaties raises questions about whether this is something for which Ireland has an economic need.  More generally, the economic evidence suggests that BITs have relatively little effect on even developing states&rsquo; ability to attract investment.  Quantitative studies are inconsistent on whether there is any positive connection between BITs and investment flows while qualitative studies and things like interviews and so on suggest that for most investors, the existence of a BIT is not something they give much weight to in deciding whether to invest so the economic case for this entire legal regime is still up in the air.<\/p><p> By contrast, BITs impose significant costs and risks.  If Ireland ratifies CETA, its investment chapter will pose a significant constraint on the State&rsquo;s ability to regulate to realise important public policies, including environmental protection, public health and housing and in any sector with significant foreign capital.  As Dr. Ankersmit highlighted, the scope of investments covered under this agreement is broad.  Nothing is carved out.  The agreement might not stop Ireland acting to pursue a particular policy but it imposes limits on what we can do and how we can do it with the threat of multibillion euro lawsuits if we get it wrong.  Prominent policies or proposals that could be challenged under similar rules include the 2008 bank guarantee, proposed reforms of the housing rental market and, more generally, efforts to decarbonise the economy and power generation.  These are the sort of measures we see challenged in other countries.  There is evidence of investment law having a chilling effect on public policies in other states and there is good reason to believe we would see a similar effect in this country.  In fact, we may already have seen this effect if we look at the recent moratorium on oil and gas exploration and the carve-out in it for existing licence holders.  I do not know the rationale for that but certainly a plausible rationale might be that similar moratoriums have been challenged under the energy charter treaty by existing licence holders so there is certainly reason to worry about the impact of CETA on this State's ability to regulate in pursuit of public policy.  Uncertainty about the rights conferred on investors, some of which remains under CETA, forces states to err on the side of caution in the way they regulate in this area.<\/p><p> The European Court of Justice, ECJ, has said a few things that are relevant to this question.  In its opinion on the EU-Singapore free trade agreement, the ECJ confirmed that including ISDS in a treaty is a significant matter that it is not merely ancillary to the EU&rsquo;s powers in relation to trade and foreign investment and that only member states themselves have the power to agree such a system so creating a right like this is not something the Union itself has the power to do.  The ECJ has also looked at CETA in particular.  Members will find more on this in the written submission but I suggest that there is not a lot in the ECJ's opinion that would allay concerns about the constraints this regime will impose on states&rsquo; regulatory autonomy or the fundamentally unequal nature of the rights this regime establishes.<\/p><p>I am happy to go into more detail on that during the discussion if that would be useful.  A further point is that, once ratified, there is nothing Ireland can do to pull back from the investor court system under CETA.  Only Canada and the EU, rather than individual member states, can terminate this agreement.  Termination is not a member state power.  Even if the agreement is terminated, these rights for investors will continue for a further 20 years so this is not a decision that can be revised lightly once made, which is something on which Dr. Ankersmit has already touched.<\/p><p> I hope this has been helpful to the committee in getting some sense of the potential risks posed to Ireland by the investor court system and in determining whether there are any real benefits on offer.

With regard to the CJEU's decision on this, as Dr. Fennelly said, the Court of Justice looked at this matter in the context of the EU legal framework and concluded that the treaty was compatible with a number of specific tests in EU law.  That decision has been invoked a number of times since as political evidence that this treaty does not interfere with the right to regulate.  There are a number of things to say about that.  The first is that what the European Court of Justice did in that case was offer its own interpretation of the meaning and effect of the relevant provisions of the treaty.  That is worthy of respect.  This is the opinion of the Continent's leading jurists so it is certainly not to be set aside readily.  However, it is not the opinion of the key decision makers for these purposes because as the Court of Justice recognises in that opinion, the ultimate question of how this treaty should be interpreted will be resolved by the CETA tribunals, that is, those who are appointed to the investor court system.  They will not be bound, and the Court of Justice is comfortable with this, by the Court of Justice's interpretation of the treaty.  The Court of Justice can give us an informed legal view of how the members of the court think it will be interpreted but they cannot give us confidence or security about how these rules will be applied.<br\/><br\/>There are reasons to be concerned about the depth to which the Court of Justice interrogated the treaty, particularly around the question of the right to regulate.  I will give the members an example.  The Court of Justice placed weight on the fact that the treaty includes exceptions by states to policies that are necessary for a number of specific goals, provided that those do not involve arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction.  That language is taken directly from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, so it is World Trade Organization language.  We are incorporating into CETA a number of exceptions that we find in WTO law.<br\/><br\/>If we then look at how those exceptions have been interpreted in the WTO law we find that in fact they are incredibly restrictive.  For example, the European Union's regime prohibiting the importation of seal products, especially an animal welfare regime, was found not to fall within those exceptions in the WTO.  That included an exception for seal products caught by Inuit communities in traditional ways.  The WTO health body essentially said that that is an arbitrary discrimination because it seems as if the same animal welfare issues arise whether the seal is killed by a commercial hunter or by an indigenous hunter so the EU regime falls.  The EU then had to try to revise its regime to be compatible with that.  That is just one example.<br\/><br\/>The key point to take from that is that the fact that there is an exception and the fact that there is a reference to a right to regulate does not actually tell us very much.  Ultimately, what matters is how these things will be interpreted by the CETA tribunal when the time comes.  The Court of Justice cannot tell the members that.  I cannot tell them that.  Nobody on this court can tell them that because ultimately the proposal is that we establish a tribunal, give it a whole lot of language, much of which is quite evaluative.  When exactly is something manifestly arbitrary?  I am guessing the members and I would disagree on particular instances.  We are then tying our hands and saying that we will comply with what that unknown group of adjudicators in the future will say.  They might interpret it in ways that are entirely compatible with a state's right to regulate or they might not, but it is important to put a question mark next to that.  I hope that is helpful on the CJEU point.<br\/><br\/>On the chilling effect point, I have to clarify my remark with regard to the existing chilling effect.  The suggestion is not that CETA itself is already having this effect but rather the states already signed up to the energy charter treaty.  The energy charter treaty includes analogous rights and remedies but specifically in the energy context.<\/p><p>For example, Italy is currently being sued under the Energy Charter Treaty because it brought in a moratorium on oil and gas exploration and did not include an exception for existing licence holders.  Two years later, we brought in a moratorium on oil and gas exploration and we did include an exception.  I have no insight into the drafting process or how the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications does its business but from the outside one would look at that sort of thing and say it is eminently plausible that somebody in the Attorney General's office or the Department said that, given what happened with the Italians, they should probably be fairly cautious in relation to this matter.<\/p><p> The literature shows different ways of trying to map this chilling effect.  Ultimately it is a hard thing to pin down because it is built around hypotheticals and trying to work out what governments would have done if it was not the case that this risk was there.  Some papers have looked at the tobacco plain packaging issue, which has been very prominent over the past three years and one of them is referenced in the submission I have given the committee.  The papers essentially say that we can look at these policies and track when they came in as proposals, whether they are open to be adopted or whether there is a delay in adoption.  We can then cross-reference that to what is happening in these high-profile international cases.  The suggestion is that there are at least two different ways that this happens.  One is through express threats, wherein an investor writes a letter to the relevant regulator saying it does not think the regulator can do this and if it does it can expect the following sorts of consequences.  We see international arbitration law firms put this forward in their marketing material as one of the services they can offer.  They can help people use these remedies to block or slow down legislation they do not like the look of.<\/p><p> The other way this operates is through the mechanism of internalisation.  Effectively, regulators come to think about these risks off their own bat.  We see examples of this in Ireland, such as in the way the Constitution has been invoked over the past few years in discussions about housing reform.  There is a sense that we cannot adopt long-term rent controls or more secure tenure because the Supreme Court told us 40 years ago that we could not.  There has been a very limited willingness to try to push that envelope.  CETA is just another set of constraints and, ultimately, threats that are available to investors to try to slow down that sort of regulation.  I hope that is helpful. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oisin Suttle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady for his question and Dr. Suttle for his answers.  I fully agree with the very elaborate answer Dr. Suttle gave on opinion 1\/17.  It is very important to emphasise that, in the end, the Court of Justice will not interpret this investment chapter when it comes to the resolution of disputes between foreign investors and governments.  What it has said on this issue, which is quite limited, will certainly not be binding for these tribunals.  An example is the interpretation that the list of situations that form the fair and equitable treatments standard is exhaustive.  Maybe the ICS tribunals will come to a different interpretation of that.  This is something for which the ICS tribunals will be responsible in the end.<\/p> <p>  I would add that I find the test of the Court of Justice quite light.  It is a legal test, not a political judgment.  Of course, in the end Ireland has to decide whether it would like to delegate the responsibility of taking that decision, weighing the public interest against the interest of the foreign investors and protecting their assets, to these ICS tribunals and to decide whether it agrees with the text by which that is done.  It is a political judgment.  What the Court of Justice does is lay out the minimum constitutional requirements from the perspective of the EU treaties.  Article 8.9 of CETA, which is the article on the right to regulate, is really just a continuation of what is already there.<\/p><p>It states the parties reaffirm their right to regulate.  It is just a continuation of the existing balance.  The use of the term \"greater certainty\" is all couched towards basically a continuation of already existing investment law practice.  It is important for parliamentarians to ask if they agree with this language.  Do they think this language will protect the public interest sufficiently?  The language could be much stronger to carve out certain claims, such as, for instance, by carving out investment in fossil fuels.  There are many more examples by which one can opt out on giving this additional layer of protection for foreign investors.<\/p><p> I do not know if I can submit more material but I wrote recently a specific article on this particular point of Opinion 1\/17.  I will forward it to the committee for it to examine.<\/p><p> On SMEs, it is a double-edged sword.  One can say that it is important that SMEs have access to this tribunal.  They should also have access to a tribunal to which they can bring claims against regulatory measures from governments.  On the one hand, it might be good for SMEs.  However, is it a good idea to expand the coverage of the investment court system, ICS, to even more investors that could make use of it?<\/p><p> In this particular context, few SMEs will make use of the ICS in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  How many small businesses in Ireland have operations in Canada?  I do not know if there are any statistics on this but a SME would have to operate across the Atlantic.  This provision is generally for big companies.<\/p><p> Investment law is run by a few big law firms in Washington, London and Paris.  They use this as an instrument to protect the interests of their client base which are multinational corporations.  These commitments to offer ICS to SMEs should not be considered as being significant because, in practice, it will be used by these law firms for the interests of their clients.  I do not expect much to come from it in helping SMEs in their fight against government regulation or intrusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laurens Ankersmit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank all three witnesses for their thoughtful and incredibly challenging presentations.

A few examples of regulatory chill that are well known include the case of New Zealand delaying for six and a half years its plain packaging legislation because of the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, case against Australia.  New Zealand delayed the introduction of plain packaging for smoking products specifically because of the ISDS case, a delay which was quite beneficial to these tobacco companies and perhaps less so for public health in New Zealand.  Another well-known example is Indonesia, which decided to continue to issue environmental permits for mining operations in Indonesia as a result of threats of ISDS litigation.  I could give the specifics on how it worked but I do not have them off the top of my head.  Another example is where Romania has decided to withdraw nomination of the Roia Montan area as a UNESCO world heritage site because if it was to become a UNESCO world heritage site the biggest gold mine in Europe in that area would not receive an environmental permit.  This is also due the ISDS claim issued by a Canadian mining company against Romania.  Romania has admitted that the ISDS case is the reason for the application withdrawal.  There are a few other examples.<\/p> <p>  A broader point may be where the Netherlands is now being sued for &euro;1.4 billion for its moratorium on the use of coal as of 2030 by a German electricity producer.  If the claim is won, that &euro;1.4 billion is a lot of money with which one could do a lot of other things such as insulation of housing and other climate change projects.  So, it is not only a matter of direct prevention of regulation, it also makes it less possible for governments to do certain things.   A figure of &euro;1.4 billion is a lot of money that could be spent on other things.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the reactions I received from Commission officials, members of the European Parliament and members of the Council when I was working as a legal adviser to ClientEarth, a public interest organisation which is also established in the UK and Belgium.  The reactions were quite diverse, as one can imagine, so it is difficult to summarise exactly the reactions.  I started my work there after completing my PhD in 2015.  Then the Commission had already received a very strong mandate to negotiate agreement with Canada that concluded investor-state dispute settlement.  They were not going to say \"Oh well, because Mr. Ankersmit [for example] raises these concerns we are no longer going to do it.\"<\/p><p>That is not how it works.  The staff of the Commission listened politely.  Basically, there is a mandate given by the Council.  The European Parliament is split.  There are a diverse number of interests.  Many people are in favour of CETA.  The biggest group in the European Parliament is the European People's Party.  That group supports CETA and the European Parliament has already consented to CETA.  There have been many different reactions, some agreeing with what I had to say and others more keen on going ahead with CETA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Fennelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Richmond for the question.  On the reference to arguments around Articles 15 and 34 of the Constitution, that is a reference to the reports on the challenge that is pending before the High Court.  There has not been any real academic engagement with the constitutionality of CETA.  In the media reports in that regard it is fairly set out that there is an argument around this issue.  To succeed before the courts one needs a fairly strong argument, particularly in the light of the Pringle judgment.<\/p> <p>  Touching upon something that arose earlier, I would make the point that in opinion 1\/17 the ECJ took a formalistic, legalistic reading of the CETA agreement.  It is fair to say that when this matter comes before the domestic courts so, too, the High Court or Supreme Court, on appeal, will be looking at it through that legal sense and in a fairly formalistic way.  The courts have emphasised in their case law in this area that they do not look to the merits of particular international agreements - the pros and cons on a policy or political basis - because that is not a matter for the courts.  Rather, it is a matter for members in the political organs.  <\/p> <p>  On the potential implications if there is not ratification, one distinct possibility is collapse of the entire agreement, and in formal terms, because of the particular clause on entry into force of the CETA agreement, that may very well be the case but, of course, one can never discount the ingenuity of member states and the Union in dealing with these issues.  One possibility, particularly if problems present around the investor court system, is the potential for severability of that from the rest of the regime, but neither the EU institutions nor the Canadians have broached that yet given the fact that this is very live before the various member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Fennelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Dr. Ankersmit has given a lot of compelling examples of chilling effect.  I refer the committee to the Moehlecke paper linked to my submission, which identifies 17 countries where the plain packaging litigation against Australia and Uruguay led to delays or non-introduction of that specific policy.  I said earlier that these sort of studies are necessarily hypothetical.  They are hypothetical in the sense that one is trying to work out whether the risk of litigation is the reason legislation was not adopted.  As researchers and human beings, what we can do is look at countries and point to a proposal for legislation, a number of relevant interest groups and a number of relevant political groups expressing their preference as regards what to do, and to where legislation is being introduced or not being introduced.  It is the nature of things that there is always a black box in the middle, which is where Government and Parliament decide whether to proceed with the legislation or not.  It is always very difficult to say what exactly was the reason to proceed one way or the other.<\/p> <p>  I will give another powerful example.  Dr. Ankersmit mentioned the claims against the Netherlands in regard to the winding down of coal.  Ten years ago, Germany faced claims when it decided to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster.  Vattenfall, the Swedish power generator, brought a claim against the German Government essential saying that its rights as the operator of nuclear power plants in Germany had been unfairly impacted by that decision.<\/p><p>That case is ongoing but it is probably significant that when Germany subsequently decided that it was going to start winding down its coal plants, it took a different route to that which the Netherlands took.  It effectively decided to buy out and pay off the operators of coal plants rather than simply regulating them out of existence.  Can I say that the reason for that is Germany's experience with the claims on nuclear energy?  I cannot say so for certain but these moves are strongly suggestive of ISDS claims having an impact on the ways particular countries choose to regulate in subsequent cases.<\/p><p> There is an example of a French climate change law from three years ago where it is prominently put forward that the original law and the law that was ultimately adopted has significantly more leeway for existing fossil fuel extractors.  Why is that so?  Part of the story we see is that there were threats of ISDS claims if the law was implemented in its original form.  Can I say the threat of the ISDS claims was definitely the reason the change happened?  I cannot say so.  A bunch of political processes happened in between but if one wants evidence, this evidence is about as compelling as one will find of why any factor, ISDS or otherwise, caused legislation to change.  This is about as good evidence as one can expect to find.<\/p><p> Deputy Richmond asked how many of these things there are.  There are going on for 3,000 of them and they are mostly bilateral treaties between pairs of countries.  This is a regime that is different from, for example, the WTO regime, where we have a single set of treaties that everyone signs up to.  In the investor regime, we generally have pairs of countries signing up to treaties which have broadly the same shape but which may vary in their particular details.<\/p><p> There are a little over 1,000 cases that we know about.  Historically, ISDS claims do not need to be made public.  One of the unique selling points of arbitration historically has been that arbitration can be confidential and secret.  Not only do we not know the details of what is happening in these cases but in many cases we may not know that the cases are happening at all.  I can give the committee a minimum number but this is the tip of iceberg and we are guessing at what is going below that.  Even broader than the unknown claims, there is the question of how many ISDS claims never make it to being a formal dispute because they take the form of a sternly worded letter, a conversation, a revised policy or even the writing of a cheque.  As with any litigation, the number of cases that end up in the Supreme Court represent a tiny subset of the number of disputes that are resolved on the basis of a particular legal machine.<\/p><p> The third question was around non-ratification and if this thing will go away if it is not ratified.  There are a couple of answers to that.  The first answer is that this is mostly a political question.  The law puts some limited bars around that.  With the exception of its investments chapters, CETA is being provisionally applied.  That means the European Union and Canada are proceeding on the basis that the treaty is enforced and giving legal effect to it , pending ratification.  There is no limit in international law on how long a treaty can provisionally be applied for.  There is no hard constraint on that.  The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states that in the event that one of the parties communicates to the other party its intention not to ratify a treaty, provisional applications should cease.  That would be a communication from the European Union to Canada saying that it is done with CETA.  It is a formal step and there is no particular requirement to take that step.<\/p><p> The more realistic answer will come if this hits a hard roadblock in any particular jurisdiction, whether here or in the Netherlands for example, as Dr. Ankersmit was saying that the Netherlands is looking like a hard case.  In Germany, this is still going to go back to the German constitutional court for its view on it.  There may be many places where this boat might strike a hole, therefore.  I am a lawyer offering a political opinion but the most likely outcome of that is a relatively minor renegotiation.  The negotiation would be relatively minor in the sense that the rest of the treaty is already in place, working and having economic effects.  What does that mean?<\/p><p>It means those who will suffer as a result of more imports in their area have already suffered that pain and those who will benefit are already getting the benefits.  Once this happens and those facts are on the ground, it is very hard to turn around and simply shut the thing down.  If this thing cannot be ratified at a national level, it will be in everybody's interests to say \"okay, well then we can just excise this chapter\" and try to keep all the good things we can get elsewhere in the agreement.<\/p><p> The other reason I think that is probably the most likely outcome politically is because trade agreements are tools that allow politicians to build political coalitions.  There are some interest groups that are pro-trade and want to export while there are others that are anti-trade because they see risks of competition from foreign producers.  The job of politicians is to try to put together good public policy and sometimes that involves telling some interest groups \"sorry guys, it's not your day\".  Trade agreements are a way to bundle together all the benefits the exporters will get and all the costs the importers will suffer so that politicians are in a position to say there are some winners and some losers and some wins and some losses but overall this thing is worth doing and they can survive politically in doing that.  All those sorts of trade-offs and log-rolling are happening elsewhere in the agreement.  There is no reason to think that taking out investment protection would lead to any group benefiting from this agreement suddenly saying \"we're no longer benefiting and we're out\" or any group suffering from the agreement saying \"well I was prepared to live with the agreement because it had investment protection but now that I'm not, suddenly you're...\" so in terms of that sort of dynamic of political coalitions and facts that have already been created on the ground, it is highly unlikely that non-ratification at a national level will be the end of this deal.  It is much more likely that it will be a case of what tweaks we can make to make this thing acceptable to the relevant groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oisin Suttle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

In respect of all the presentations we have received so far, the focus of our attention has been on the investor court system.  How likely is it that we can continue formalising the current CETA agreement without the investor court system being ratified?  Dr. Ankersmit has talked to the European Commission and the European Parliament.  Linking into Dr. Ankersmit's paper, the presentation we have been given is that this is the ideal opportunity for Canada and the EU, both of which have very developed legal systems, to refine and improve the existing arbitration systems and that this gives us an opportunity to model that.

There was mention of a rate of 28.7%, which seems like a colossal success rate.  We all have the fear of being taken over the coals about legitimate expectations of future profits.

Is the system of appointment open, transparent and accountable or is it political?  Could Dr. Ankersmit give any insight into how trustworthy or objective the institution at the centre of the investor court system can be, given the appointment of judges and so forth?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#Q00500","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I apologise as the sound broke up briefly.  I thank Deputy Haughey for his interesting questions.  There is a distinct change in tone between Crotty and Pringle in terms of how the judgments engage with sovereignty.  The distinction between exercise and alienation is really at the centre of that judgment.  I think it will be the central test whenever the courts come to this issue again.<\/p> <p>  First, regarding the ICC and the initial commitment to put the UPC to a referendum, it is important to understand that this took place before the Pringle judgment.  Post Crotty, there was quite understandably a very cautious approach when it came to international agreements involving some form of transfer of sovereignty.  The ICC on the one hand involves a certain transfer of executive and judicial power, but in a very limited area, which is the jurisdiction to try certain types of crime such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  There are obligations on the State under the Rome statute to co-operate with the ICC to arrest and surrender individuals suspected of crimes and also to give effect to decisions of the ICC.  Because of those characteristics, there is a qualification of the judicial power and alienation of that judicial power in a very limited space, but in an important way nonetheless.  It is against that backdrop that the ICC statute was put to a referendum.  Whether one would do so today, in light of Pringle, is a more difficult question.<\/p> <p>  That brings us to the UPC.  This has been rumbling on for some time.  It has also found its way to the European Court of Justice.  It is still on our agendas today.  There has been a commitment by successive Governments to put this to a referendum.  In understanding that issue, it is important to look at the specific characteristics of the unified patent court.  In particular, that court has a lot of similarities with the traditional EU courts, the Court of Justice in particular, when it comes to the enforceability of its judgments directly within the member state.  It is because of that particular quality of the court's structure under the UPC system and its decisions that Governments have taken the view, in light of Crotty and presumably still in light of Pringle, that it should be put to the people.  That is why in looking at the CETA tribunal we must look at its specific qualities.  I refer to particular elements of it which say that the CETA tribunal cannot express a view on domestic law or cannot make findings in respect of domestic laws and measures.  We have heard different views about how far that may go.  That is a feature that potentially distinguishes it from the UPC, but overall in light of Crotty and even now with Pringle there has been a cautious approach in this area because Governments are very concerned at the potential ramifications of ratifying, but with the risk of a challenge and the unravelling of the international commitment and all that that would entail.<\/p><p>I give some other examples of international agreements in the paper.  Ireland has been an active supporter of international disputes settlement.  It was the first state to sign up to the right of petition before the European Court of Human Rights way back in the 1950s and has been an active supporter of other forms of international dispute systems.<\/p><p> We have not participated as much in the investor protection sphere, as Dr. Suttle and others have outlined, even though foreign direct investment has been important to us.  Our trade agreements with the US, which, again, date back to the 1950s, contain important investor protection elements but without the dispute settlement piece.  However, there are many examples of international courts, tribunals and quasi-judicial bodies.  The WTO was mentioned and it has a sophisticated dispute settlement mechanism, albeit one that has run into significant difficulty in recent years because of problems with the appointment of members to its appellate body.  There are many examples of tribunals, not exactly like the CETA tribunal, but with some similar qualities which the State has signed up to without a referendum but each must be examined in its own terms.  <\/p><p> I refer to the point on the domestic courts not directly raised with me but which is important.  It is an important piece of the jigsaw that we should not neglect because even if the investor tribunal system were to fall away, investors from all jurisdictions, including Canada, have significant rights in this jurisdiction under domestic law, including under our Constitution, and the strong protection given to property rights over the years in the courts' jurisprudence in particular.  We should not be too soft on the potential implications of this.  <\/p><p> If one was advising one of these investors on whether to go for a CETA tribunal or before the domestic courts, in many instances, one might nudge them towards the domestic courts given the robust protections under our Constitution.  It leads to similar issues we have talked about such as the balance between property rights and other important public interest policy objectives, which is the subject of an ongoing debate before our courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Fennelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin for the question.  Nobody has ever denied that states have the right to regulate.  One or two investment arbitration decisions may have dropped the ball on that and expressly said the legal regime has to be strictly maintained.  However, every investment tribunal and this treaty recognise states have the right to regulate subject to the international law rights guaranteed to investors.  One can do whatever one wants subject to the rights which are being created.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the point made by Dr. Ankersmit made the point at the start on the weight we should give to the language and it is a question of framing to a great extent.  Framing can be important for lawyers because it gives a steer to those who have to interpret the hard rules but it only gives a steer and, ultimately, the interpretation is for the tribunal.  When one considers the concrete details of the rights as set out in CETA, they do not give the freedom one might like.  For example, CETA includes an annex on what constitutes indirect expropriation.  These are situations where the state takes a step, through regulation or otherwise, not to seize the title to an investment but does something to adversely affect the value of the investment or the investors' right to use or transfer their investment, in a way that is equivalent to having the property seized from their point of view.  <br\/><br\/>Forgive me for reading some legal text but I am a lawyer.  The final paragraph of the annex states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFor greater certainty, except in the rare circumstance when the impact of a measure or series of measures is so severe in light of its purpose that it appears manifestly excessive, non-discriminatory measures of a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations. <\/blockquote> <p>A quick read of that indicates it is a guarantee of the right to regulate.<\/p><p>In fact, it is not.  The first half of that paragraph is an invitation to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, tribunal to perform a proportionality analysis.  It is an invitation to the CETA tribunal to ask, in light of the purpose of the measure and the goal one is pursuing, if the effect on the investor is manifestly excessive.  It is weighing and balancing the public policy and the impact on the investor.  This is the style of analysis that the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights do.  It is a style of analysis, however, that directly engages with the trade-offs between the goals legislators pursue and their costs.<\/p><p> One can contrast that final paragraph of that annex to CETA with Article 5.5 of the Indian model for a bilateral investment treaty.  This is essentially the text that Indian negotiators take into the room when they discuss a new investment treaty.  The contrast is very easy.  Article 5.5 simply is the second half of that paragraph of CETA.  It states non-discriminatory regulatory measures will not constitute expropriations.  CETA states if it is a non-discriminatory regulation, then a proportionality analysis should be performed.  If it seems disproportionate, then it is expropriation.  If it is not disproportionate, then it is fine.<\/p><p> That is a significant restriction on a state's power to regulate.  It is explicitly mandated in the text.  As was said, one is getting different people giving different views, however.  How does one deal with that?  As I said earlier, I cannot tell how this text will be interpreted.  Ultimately, one is appointing, as yet, an unnamed group of jurists to decide for themselves what this text means and to do so largely in an unreviewable way.  One is buying a pig in a poke.  Sometimes one must do that.  What one should ask, however, is does one really need a pig.  If one needs a pig, then one has to take what is on offer.  This is why my paper started where it does.<\/p><p> The key issue in coming at this is what exactly is the value for the State of adopting these rules.  The economic evidence would state probably not very much.  Many economists have tried to work out exactly what effect investment treaties have on investment flows.  In fairness, more of them have said they probably have an effect than those who have said they do not.  It is certainly not overwhelming.  What we do not have is a clear sense of when they have a fan effect and in which sectors.<\/p><p> We think they are probably more likely to stimulate investment in mining and resource extraction.  Those are not necessarily areas where we might want to stimulate investment.  We are pretty sure they are more likely to stimulate investment in developing and developed countries.  Again, Ireland may not be in line to get much of an economic benefit from this.<\/p><p> It has been suggested that most of the studies that show a big positive effect are driven by the fact that in the context of former Soviet states they had a positive effect.  It might just be that bilateral investment treaties are a really good way to reassure investors in former Soviet countries that they are not going back to that system.<\/p><p> There is uncertainty.  The key point is that one is trying to make a decision under conditions of uncertainty.  No legal advice can resolve that.  Ultimately, this will only be interpreted when the time comes.  We need to consider what is the value of taking the risk.  It is a big risk, a point no one can deny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oisin Suttle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The question was asked what would happen if Ireland were not to ratify CETA or an EU member state rejected it.  When it comes to provisional application, CETA is being provisionally applied right now.<\/p><p>It can be provisionally applied indefinitely if neither party indicates to the other that it has no intention of ratifying the agreement.  For instance, the United States provisionally applied the general agreement on tariffs and trade for a few decades before the WTO agreements came into force.  It could be done for a very long period.  As Dr. Fennelly mentioned, in these situations, the EU can be quite ingenious and smart in trying to find a solution to matters.  For instance, the Mercosur agreement is supposed to be a mixed agreement and also requires ratification by member states but there is now a push to split the agreement, as was done with the Singapore agreement.  There is a push to split the Mercosur agreement into a trade part and another, more political, part while the idea with the Singapore agreement is to have a split between a trade part and an investment part.  Such a thing could also be done with CETA.  This agreement could be applied provisionally until there is a new text to ratify at EU level only.  This would sideline the member states completely because one of the two reasons their involvement in the ratification of CETA is required is that the investment court system would remove disputes from the jurisdiction of the member states, as the ECJ has said.  This means that members states must be involved in the ratification process.  <\/p><p> All kinds of creative solutions are possible but, in the meantime, this agreement could be provisionally applied indefinitely.  I do not see any objection to that unless, for some reason, Canada is notified that the EU and its member states will not ratify the agreement.  It is a bilaterally structured agreement, which means that the members states ratify the agreement first, followed by the EU by way of a decision of the European Council.  At this point, the EU and the member states will notify Canada that they have completed the steps necessary for ratification.  This can all be found in CETA itself.  The final provisions outline exactly how provisional application works, how it can be ended and how the agreement is to be ratified.  To make a long story short, there are plenty of solutions if a member state, possibly the Netherlands or Ireland, opposed one part of the agreement.  An additional protocol could also be agreed.  All kinds of solutions are possible.<\/p><p> I have heard a few people say that CETA is completely dead, that this will be end of it and that it is the nuclear option but I do not find that very convincing when one considers the enormous interest in the rest of the agreement, particularly from an economic perspective.  I hope I have answered the question.<\/p><p> Deputy Howlin asked about the issue of sidestepping domestic courts.  Under the ICS outlined in CETA, it is entirely possible for foreign investors to sidestep Irish courts.  The foreign investor has the choice to go to the Irish courts or to the ICS.  If it decides to go to the ICS, it can obtain a ruling from an ICS tribunal, which can be enforced throughout the world.  In American courts, economic detective firms are sometimes hired.  These know where assets are and target the particular country where they are held to obtain those assets if, for example, the Irish Government is unwilling to abide by the award issued by the ICS tribunal.  It is a bit of an unlikely situation, but it could happen.<\/p><p>If there are significant issues with a particular ruling of an investment court system, ICS, tribunal, the Irish Government could refuse to pay and go to a court somewhere else in another member state.  That is entirely possible.  That happened in the Achmea judgment, where enforcement of an award was sought in a German court against the Czech Republic.  There are plenty of examples.  The Micula cases are also examples where American courts are involved in the enforcement of an award.  It is entirely up to the investor to choose where it wants to go.  If it considers the Irish courts not to be a good option, it can do so.  It gives foreign investors an additional option.  Investors will choose the Irish courts when it is better for them, which makes sense, but when it is not better for them, they now have an additional avenue to pursue.  I always compare it with playing an away game and a home game.<\/p><p> For a foreign investor, this is very much a home game, while for a government, this is an away game.  It depends on where these tribunals are based but if one goes to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, for instance, one will go to litigate in Washington, D.C.  That is where the Dutch Government is heading.  It is playing an away game.  Normally the Dutch district court of The Hague would be responsible for claims against the Government.  This is the district court that handed down the Urgenda judgment.  I do not know if members have ever heard of the Urgenda judgment.  It is a climate case.  That court has ruled that the Dutch Government has to take more serious steps to fight climate change.  Now of course, the German investor is not going to go to that district court, because the ICS is probably much more favourable to it.<\/p><p> That brings me to the last point, on the appointment process of these tribunal members and whether they are objective.  That is a difficult thing to achieve.  In most domestic systems, there is a constitutional court, which generally has all kinds of cases come before it.  It is not a court that only hears one side of the argument all the time.  The investment court system generally has investment law experts.  In the constitution of the tribunal article, which is Article 8.27, paragraph 4, of CETA, there is a lot of nice language, that they need to be jurists of recognised competence, but it is also desirable that they have expertise in international investment law.  That means that one will source these arbitrators from a particular legal community, who look at disputes in a certain way and have been trained to look at disputes in a certain way.  Will that affect the impartiality of these tribunals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laurens Ankersmit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I will have to cut in there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#V00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will stop talking there.

Is it not a given to say that all or some of the hallmarks of arbitration are that it is done in private, it is confidential, binding and enforceable?  Although it is not an <i>ad hoc<\/i>arbitration, where does one get recourse to the courts, if at all, if there is an error on the face of the arbitration?  It may have been in the award or the arbitrator may have misconducted the investor court state dispute arbitration.  Where in this agreement is the recourse to the courts?  If one opts for arbitration, does it stay in the domestic court, as often applies?  One cannot be in two different places at the same time.  How does one go back to the courts?  I would like to know that.  Removing an arbitrator is provided for under the Irish Constitution.  I am not making political points today, but I would say that we have a fine judicial system in Ireland, as does Canada.<\/p><p>However, I accept that some jurisdictions do not.  I can see a purpose for this but I am far from convinced that one size fits all when we have such a brilliantly fair system, which has been tried and tested and exercises and delivers judgments beyond fear or favour.  That is my first question.<\/p><p> Second, we have adopted some agreements without recourse to a referendum, like the Aarhus Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Do the expert speakers think this agreement is different as regards sovereignty?  Would it have more in common with the unified patent court, for instance?

If not, I would be grateful to hear their comments.<\/p><p> I have a final question for Dr. Fennelly and Dr. Suttle, if it does not put them on the spot.  A former judge has expressed the view that Pringle has put Crotty to sleep.  Do either of them have an opinion on that?  It is perfectly legitimate and the intellectual discussions are invigorating but there seems to be an incremental move to undermine - for want of a better term because I do not mean it in a pejorative sense - or water down Crotty.  Could it be that the correct case, which could be closer on all fours with Crotty, has not arrived yet?  That might stroke the monster's back, to quote Kavanagh, a non-lawyer.  It is the monster that I admire.  It might not be the correct term but it is a creature of constitutional vigilance for the people of Ireland, which is being slightly eroded by jurisprudence and expert commentary.  Maybe the commentary follows the jurisprudence.  I accept that.  Do the expert speakers concur with former Supreme Court Justice Mr. Hugh Geoghegan, who said Crotty is slowly being put to sleep?  From a political perspective I certainly hope it is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#V00500","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I confirm that I am on the campus grounds of the Oireachtas.

The first is for Dr. Ankersmit.  There is a different treatment of regulation in Article 8.9.2 of CETA versus the treatment of removal of subsidy in Article 8.9.4.  It is notable that Article 8.9.2 states that the \"mere fact\" of regulation is not a breach.  That has been dealt with very well, whereas Article 8.9.4 states that the removal of a subsidy should not be seen as requiring a party to compensate the investor.  There is a different protection there and it seems to make it explicitly clear that the parties have chosen not to take away the requirement for compensation in respect of regulation.  Regarding the European Court of Justice ruling 1\/17, Dr. Ankersmit has made it very clear that the arbitrators are not bound by that ruling.  They may consider domestic law but are not required to do so.  Their balancing, even in those proportionality tests, does not need to consider those things.  I am interested in the payment structures.<\/p><p>We have talked about the appointment but the payment structures have been identified as an issue of concern .  The ECJ 1\/17 ruling, as I understand it, explicitly asked that the payment structure system of the ICS be fixed and addressed with sufficient time to allow member states to consider it in their ratification process.  It has not really been changed, as I understand.<\/p><p> My next question is to Dr. Fennelly in respect of the open-ended aspect.  The 20-year exit clause has been called a zombie clause or a sunset clause.  The 20 years for which the ICS would apply, even if Ireland decided to leave, would exceed the terms of three or four parliaments.  Could that create a tension?<\/p><p> My final question is for anyone who wishes to comment.  Dispute mechanisms between states are continuing in agreements and investors are being removed.  There is a difference between dispute mechanisms between states that are parties and are making agreements with each other, and giving powers to investors that are not parties to the agreement.  That seems to have been the trend in the UK, China and elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#W00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

One option an investor suing Ireland will always have is to go under the ICSID convention regime - the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes - because we are parties to that convention.  If the arbitration is under the ICSID convention then no court anywhere in the world has any oversight role in relation to the arbitration.  The only remedy that the ICSID tribunal provides when something goes wrong in arbitration is an application to ICSID itself, which essentially is a World Bank sister organisation, to annul the award.  To date there are 285 awards under the ICSID convention.  Of those, 66 have been challenged with an application for annulment, five have been annulled in full and 12 have been annulled in part.  What does this tell us?  It tells us that at least under ICSID there is no role for the courts in supervising.  The supervisory jurisdiction of ICSID itself is a very high bar to cross.  Once the decision is rendered and is not annulled by ICSID, it is enforceable in the courts of any ICSID party and any European convention party.  It is enforceable in Ireland.  The Irish Arbitration Act provides that the result of an arbitration under the ICSID convention is not subject to any review by the Irish courts at the point of enforcement.  There is scope for the Irish courts to examine any other arbitration from a public policy perspective.  If it is an arbitration under the ICSID convention, which is what a CETA investment tribunal decision will be, then the Irish courts have no power to do anything except give effect to it.  The Minister for Finance is empowered to do one thing and one thing only, which is to write a cheque.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Duffy's question on the difference of this tribunal, I will stay away from judging it from an Irish constitutional point of view because there are things I know about and things I do not.  The Irish Constitution is something I will definitely leave to Dr. Fennelly.  Deputy Duffy asked what is different about this, and there are some key things to look at.<\/p> <p>  One aspect is revisability, which we have touched on a number of times.  If Ireland wants to leave the European Convention on Human Rights it can do so.  It takes six months.  If Ireland wants to leave CETA then it needs to leave the European Union and Ireland would still be stuck with it for 20 years after that.  From a non-technical and non-constitutional perspective that seems like an important question with regard to deciding what sort of constraint on sovereignty Ireland is accepting.<\/p> <p>  A second aspect is impact.  Where are the really big powerful decisions happening, such as decisions that can really push states around?  They are happening in investment arbitration.  If one contrasts the sorts of implications for a state of an adverse decision in, for example, a World Trade Organization, WTO, health body versus an investment arbitration decision, it is much easier to find a workaround in the case of the WTO dispute settlement system than it is in the case of the investment system.<\/p> <p>  The third aspect is enforcement.  Because decisions of the CETA tribunal are, at least formally, arbitration decisions they are enforceable under the ICSID convention and under the New York convention.  This means they are much more legally powerful than the decisions made even at the European Court of Human Rights.  Ultimately, enforcement of a decision of the European Court of Human Rights is a political matter.  I see Dr. Fennelly knitting his brows and he may have a different view on that.  Enforcement of one of these decisions is much more automatic, once one gets past that relatively low bar of ICSID annulment.<\/p><p>Those are the factors to consider, not as a constitutional lawyer but rather as somebody who thinks about international law and the way it constrains states in pursuing their policy goals.  Deputy Duffy asked a yes or no question about whether this will constrain public policy, and the answer is \"Yes\".  I do not think it is sensible to think that there will not be at least some constraint.  The extent of that constraint will depend on how it is interpreted.  Ultimately, this certainly puts some bars around what Irish Parliaments can and cannot do.  Those are new bars additional to the ones already there in the Constitution from European law and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021040600002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oisin Suttle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators and Deputy Duffy for all those questions.  They really get to the heart of the matter.  Regarding the enforcement of an award, I refer Deputies and Senators to Article 8.41.  I agree with Dr. Suttle that there is very limited scope for challenging an award.  If it were made to be enforced under the New York Convention, there is some possibility of challenging it on public policy grounds, but even then it on a limited basis, and our Arbitration Act gives effect to those conventions as a matter of Irish law.<\/p> <p>  Senator Martin's question about whether Crotty lives on is the big question and it is a difficult one.  I do not think that Pringle puts Crotty to sleep but it puts serious brakes on the implications of Crotty.  It confirms that the courts will intervene only in limited cases.  Crotty lives on.  It will continue to be relevant when it comes to major revisions of the European treaties and possibly other treaties such as the one about which we are talking.  Whether that is so is ultimately a matter the courts will have to pronounce upon.  The statement of the European Association of Judges was given before the European Court of Justice pronounced on it and was primarily on EU law issues.  It has to be understood in the light of the subsequent Opinion 1\/17.  It is important to emphasise, as I do in the paper, that the question of whether there should be a referendum is not just a matter for the courts.  Members of the D&aacute;il can table a Bill to amend the Constitution if they consider it is appropriate and given the implications of a particular international agreement and its legitimacy.  It is important the political power in that regard is vested with the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  On Senator Higgins's question about the tribunal and the open-ended nature of the commitment under CETA, it is true that the EU and member states would have to give 180 days of notice to terminate the agreement.  We are locked in because it is a mixed agreement with respect to the EU.  There is a sunset clause for the investor protection elements.  That is a reflection of the nature of investment protection.  Investors come and they stay for a certain time, so it is part of the legal certainty this agreement purports to give.  It is a limitation.  Whether or not it is so open-ended that it would constitute a transfer of powers under the Constitution that would require a referendum is more difficult to determine.  Many international agreements involve limitations of this kind.  The court would have to assess that in the round.<\/p> <p>  Regarding whether the right to compensation would require legislation, it is a reason why the role of the D&aacute;il is important in approving this, since it could impose a charge on public funds.  It goes back to the point about political accountability resting in the D&aacute;il.  The standard of fair and equitable treatment is well-established in international law.  It is organic and as Dr. Suttle and Dr. Ankersmit said, while one does not know what precise interpretation that CETA tribunal might give, because of the provisions I have referred to, it would constitute legislation within the meaning of the Constitution, with regard to bringing into play the principles and policies test.  It may have an indirect effect, which is something we have heard about in the context of this chilling effect.<\/p> <p>  On international dispute mechanisms, Dr. Suttle is right that the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights are not directly and automatically binding within our legal system, but Ireland as a State is under international obligations to give effect to those decisions and to the decisions of bodies such as the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee as well as more court-like bodies of the kind we are talking about here.  Ireland has been actively involved in these different mechanisms.  Whether this agreement is so exceptional as to require the vote of the people, it is before the courts and will require careful consideration by the courts.  Whether Pringle sets a high threshold, going back to Senator Martin's question, Crotty lives on, so we will have to wait to see how the courts ultimately pronounce on that issue.

My name is Conor McCabe and I am the principal officer in the Department's marine planning policy and legislation unit.  I am accompanied by other members of the marine planning team and also through video link: Mr. Tom Woolley, marine planning adviser; Ms Juliet Fitzpatrick, assistant principal; Mr. Martin O'Meara, assistant principal; Ms Marie Duffin, administrative officer; and Ms Tracey O'Connor, executive officer.  Also joining us is Ms Anne-Marie Clancy from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Ms Caitriona Nic Aonghusa from the Marine Institute.<\/p> <p>  There has been a cross-Government programme over the last three and a half years to develop a marine spatial plan for the State &ndash; what we call the national marine planning framework, the NMPF.  The development of an overarching national marine spatial plan was first identified as a Government policy objective in Ireland's integrated marine plan, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, HOOW.<\/p><p>This plan identified that the organisation, regulation and protection of marine-based activity in Irish waters was being carried out on a sectoral and demand-driven basis, without a strategic framework.<\/p><p> Marine spatial planning, MSP, is also underpinned by EU legislation.  The 2014 MSP directive established an EU-wide framework for marine spatial planning and defined it as \"a process by which the relevant member state's authorities analyse and organise human activities in marine areas to achieve ecological, economic and social objectives.\"  The directive was transposed under EU regulations into the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 and the NMPF now has the same legislative footing as the national planning framework. <\/p><p> It is our belief that marine plans should be strategic as well as instructional and informed by effective public and stakeholder participation.  Therefore, a core objective has been to ensure that, as well as the wider public, all relevant stakeholders are consulted and encouraged to contribute.  This dialogue has been, and will continue to be, facilitated in a number of ways.  An interdepartmental group was established to aid the development of the plan.  The group is chaired by my Department and is made up of senior representatives from relevant Departments and agencies.  There is also an advisory group, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, made up of key stakeholders from the economic, environmental and social pillars and a parallel process of stakeholder engagement, with a strong focus on coastal communities and unaligned stakeholders.  This strand has been, and remains, critically important.<\/p><p> Public consultation on the NMPF began in 2018, beginning a lengthy process during which the marine planning team attended a large number of national and international marine spatial planning events, numbering over 150.  Over the course of the last three years, we have met a wide variety of marine stakeholders, including our European marine spatial planning counterparts, UK neighbours, fisheries community, regional port authorities, marine social scientists, marine safety experts such as the Commissioners for Irish Lights, Defence Forces who have responsibility for sea fisheries protection, aquaculture representatives, environmental groups and marine industry representatives, particularly those involved in offshore renewable energy and electricity generation.  Our record of attended events shows that during these engagements we visited 24 of the 26 counties in Ireland.  A public consultation on the baseline report was open for three months from September to December 2018.  During this time, five regional events were held to launch the baseline report and promote awareness of the opportunity for public participation in the process.  The output from this consultation informed the development of the draft NMPF.<\/p><p> We published the draft NMPF and launched a public consultation on it in November 2019, with seven coastal regional public meetings taking place between November 2019 and March 2020.  We then moved the consultation online, reacting to the public health guidelines relating to Covid-19.  As outlined previously to this committee, we focused on coastal locations in order to maximise engagement opportunities for those citizens and stakeholders most impacted by the NMPF.  Throughout the process, the Department endeavoured to promote awareness and understanding of the NMPF, and encouraged public participation in the planning process.  I am satisfied that the finalised NMPF will be fully informed by these consultations and can truly call itself a citizen-driven plan.<\/p><p> The programme for Government accords an important priority to finalising the NMPF.  The NMPF will set out the Government's vision for all primary human activities in the maritime area and is informed by existing and emerging Government policies for those areas and will be the primary decision-making tool for those charged with making decisions on development applications for all marine activities.  Policy and plan makers will be obliged to meet the objectives of the framework, thus creating a joined-up approach to policies that to date have often been developed linearly.<\/p><p> If it suits the Chairman and the committee my team and I can address implementation and governance arrangements during today's session rather than in this opening statement.<\/p><p>The national marine planning framework will ensure that there is a better planned and better managed maritime area, with a co-ordinated, inclusive and coherent approach to decision-making and governance, including the long-term vision for proper management, enforcement and environmental protection of our seas.  That concludes my statement on the NMPF.  I thank the committee members for their interest.  We are happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021040600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCabe.

Every agency, user, Department and commercial or societal user seems to be covered in it, as is environmental protection to a great degree.  As an overall strategy for the interaction of all of those users, it covers a great amount of ground.  Mr. McCabe mentioned consultation with the public and with stakeholders.  A wide range of stakeholders are involved in the advisory group and public consultation on the framework was wide and spread out geographically.  Much information is brought together in the framework, especially the mapping and the links to other strategy or guidance documents for other sectors involved in the marine.  It is a document to which I will refer anybody who has an inquiry about maritime or marine activity.  It stands up to that test.

In some respects, this is only the start, but still I say \"well done\".  It is of great importance that we set out the strategic planning objectives for all of the economic and environmental activities in our marine territory.

I appreciate them.  There are a number of strands to this.  I might share the floor with some of my colleagues in answering.  Initially, the governance of the national marine planning framework at a high level will be carried out as part of the Project Ireland 2040 family.  We are working with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the moment to create a governance group.  This was identified in the programme for Government, where it is called \"Project Ireland Marine 2040\".  This will be something of a subgroup to the broader Project Ireland 2040 oversight board.  We will seek to align the NMPF with the national development plan and the document Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth 2, which is currently being developed and which will be the successor to the very successful Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth.  All of these plans, including the statutory, strategic and financial plans, should speak in harmony with one another.  At the highest level, that is the broad governance arrangement.  I will now speak to the other arrangements we have in place.<\/p><p>As I mentioned, we have an advisory group which has been critical to the development of the NMPF and in getting us this far.  I hope it will transform somewhat, but not totally.  I would like it to be the same membership, feeding into an implementation advisory group, so it will have oversight and give us the handrails, as it were, and steer us as we go forward.

I should add it is going to be a focus of activity following establishment of the plan.<\/p> <p>  Focusing on monitoring in particular, we will be taking a number of steps.  As Mr. McCabe mentioned, we will be doing this working with stakeholders and with various Departments across the Government.  An important principle to bear in mind is that implementation and monitoring are obviously very much linked.  Implementation is about applying a plan and monitoring is looking at how well that has been done, how effective it is, the results of the plan having been applied.  One of the first steps on the path will be to agree what we are calling a monitoring approach, which will be a system of measures we will put in place to make sure we are looking at every aspect of the plan as it has been applied.  That is process, outcome and context monitoring.  We will be looking at that in partnership with the Marine Institute.<\/p> <p>  Some of the first steps we will be looking at will include establishing a baseline.  In the first days of the plan, whichever policy it might be we are looking at, we will look at what is the current situation and then as time goes on we can monitor progress on a plan via process, outcome and context against that baseline.  We will be establishing indicators and looking at the best available knowledge to understand the change that has come about as a result of the plan being applied.  As a result, we would like to establish a semi-regular reporting process, potentially yearly, depending on what is agreed with the stakeholders involved.  Through that process we will develop a good baseline for making recommendations as and when it is time to update the NMPF.<\/p> <p>  I hope that gives a short snapshot to our approach to monitoring and what we have planned.  It will be an evolving field.  Every policy area will vary in terms of how much confidence we can put behind understanding and being able to monitor the situation.  Where we can, we will take advantage of existing monitoring programmes.

I thank the Department for the briefing material and for the very detailed private briefing it gave us last week.  Like Senator Fitzpatrick, I acknowledge that this is a hugely significant piece of work, but also a hugely significant statutory framework for future planning in the marine area.<\/p> <p>  One of the concerns I want to raise at the outset is that this is a statutory plan, so it has in many respects a similar status as law does.  It will be the statutory basis upon which planning decisions on a wide range of activities will be made in the marine space in the future.  When one thinks about what normally happens with legislation, which is that the Government produces it, the Oireachtas scrutinises it, potentially amends it and finally agrees it through a procedure in both Houses of the Oireachtas, with this, it is a different process.  It is important we put that on the table.  It is great that we get a public briefing, but we may or may not get further committee or D&aacute;il sessions.  We are not involved as legislators in the making of this plan in the same way as we would be with legislation.  The reason I say that is that Article 15.2.1&deg; of the Constitution is very clear in placing the exclusive responsibility for making legislation with the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>It seems to me that we are not making something; we are being asked to approve it after it has been made.  That is a significant statement of fact.<\/p><p> Following the private briefing on the last day we met, we had some discussion on the formal legal procedure for this, which caused me to take a look at section 73 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.  It provides not just for this type of session but, for example, for a relevant Oireachtas committee to scrutinise the plan, produce a report, make recommendations, etc. such that we are not constrained by whether we proceed from here to a D&aacute;il motion to approve.  It is important that members acknowledge that.  I think we need to scrutinise this to the maximum extent possible without delaying the process in any way.  I have not yet finished reading the 400-page plan.  It is very technical and much of it is way beyond my own competence, let alone the technical accompanying data and documents.  I think this committee needs to do a little more than have one briefing on this.  We need a formal pre-legislative scrutiny process and report, followed by D&aacute;il and Seanad debates before any motion is proposed.  I intend to propose this formally at the end of today's meeting.<\/p><p> I have two questions, the first of which relates to the constitutional and legal question.  Has the Department secured sufficient legal advice with respect to how this is proposed to be approved by the Oireachtas?  Is it satisfied that it is fully compliant with the Constitution and the relevant section of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, which I mentioned earlier?  If we pass this, we want it to be legally and constitutionally robust.  I am interested in hearing the Department's views on that question.<\/p><p> My second question is on an issue I have been raising consistently since the start of this process, namely, the marine protected areas.  We do not have those designations mapped out.  We do not even have sensitivity mapping of where they might be as we move from the very low identification to the 30% that we need at a later stage.  It seems to me that by approving a plan without adequate mapping, we are requiring planning officials from local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to have to make very complex planning decisions without visibility of the marine protected areas and, therefore, the impact of any possible planning decision on the ecosystems of those protected areas.  It is a little like approving a county development plan without having the zoning map and matrix approved at the outset, something all of us who have a background in local government would acknowledge to be a roundabout or back-to-front way of doing things.  What can the witnesses say to us on the issue of the marine protected areas and the lack of sensitivity mapping and how, if and when this plan is approved, that will make planning decisions by planning officials difficult if not, in some case, impossible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021040600002#D00400","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for his comments and questions.  I am not sure where to start.  To be fair, the two questions posed by the Deputy are not really for us.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and written into law.  We are only following the lead that Members such as Deputy &Oacute; Broin would have fed into the legislative process.  We are following that to a T by seeking to have a public hearing on this plan.  Any committee can engage with us on it.  I am not sure what more I can say.  The legislation was written and approved by both Houses and it is line with the Constitution, I presume.  It is not for me to comment further.  As I said, we are following the legislation only recently passed in 2018.  This is part of that process.  The recommendations the committee decides to make are a matter for the committee further to this process.  As I said last week, my team and I are open to any type of hearing on this.  We are happy to make ourselves available to any committee that would like to engage with us.<br\/><br\/>On the marine protected areas, as the Deputy will know, there is a separate process under way.

It is not just about marine protected areas, MPAs.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has had input into many of the decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and so on.  It is not as if they will be taken in isolation of environmental concerns.  The NMPF is clear that there must be an ecosystem-based approach to areas' development.

We have been working with organisations such as the Irish Planning Institute, the Local Government Management Agency and others to run events.

There was a big appetite among local authorities to understand what was going on, not just in terms of the plan but the legislation on which the committee has already heard evidence, as well as what has been mentioned on the marine protected areas.  There is a substantial awareness in that community that significant changes are afoot and it needs to consider what is coming and be ready for it.<\/p><p>In my talk to the IPI, Irish Planning Institute, last week, for example, I emphasised that this is a plan and it should not see this as separate.  Instead, wherever possible, it should seek to integrate it as a factor in its existing planning mechanisms.  That will be a theme I will be looking at continuing as we engage with people implementing this plan.  While the NMPF for various reasons has quite a different look and feel, both to local authority plans and to national policy, it fits and tries to deliver things from the international level all the way down to local level in one go.  We must make people feel comfortable in that this is not entirely foreign to the systems they already have and can be bought into.

It is the first time we have taken on developing marine planning.  It has not been done in the past.  We know that from the previous engagements with the Department on the marine area planning Bill.<\/p> <p>  The NMPF is not a delivery document.  It is not a method for delivery whereby all developments and actions will be subjected to the usual planning process, the usual licensing agreements and the usual oversight in terms of environmental or other appropriate assessments.  The process to deliver any development in the marine area will be subject to the marine planning Bill.  The NMPF is an overall strategy document on how we bring all the users and agencies together, as well as how we consider the natural, amenity, social and commercial value of the sea.<\/p> <p>  On page 56 of the NMPF, it states fish populations are generally improving since reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Does that refer to fish populations in the Irish area or at EU level?  If possible, we would like to get the supporting documentation for that statement.<\/p> <p>  Another area the NMPF covers is amenity use of the sea.  In the past year, we have seen that sea swimming has become popular.  For people who are lucky enough to live within 5 km of the sea or have a suitable bathing spot within a 5 km radius, we have seen a massive uptake in sea swimming.  I have seen it in my area and all along the coast in Wicklow.  We  test bathing water only during the bathing season, however.  Blue flags can be designated to, or scores given, to bathing areas based on these tests.<\/p><p>Regarding an overall strategy, I would suggest that sea swimming is an annual pastime and we should expand the testing regime to 12 months of the year to give people an indication of water quality.  Dublin City Council is working on a proposal relating to that.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  Is this something that should fit into an overall marine framework?<\/p><p> Regarding the strategy on pollution control, habitat protection and water quality, does this framework provide further scope and resources and a bit more firepower to look at the terrestrial source of that pollution, because the sea is the ultimate sink?  Anything that comes from the land eventually ends up in the sea.  That is the end of the pipe.  We know a lot of land-based activities such as agriculture, forestry and municipal wastewater discharges are the main contributors to poor water quality in our rivers and lakes, but this ultimately ends up in the sea.  Will this framework give more scope to address those terrestrial-based pollution sources?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021040600002#H00300","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The Chairman's questions are very specific in one sense about the policy areas.

In terms of the assessments, he will find both in the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, report and the Natura 2000 impact statement there are quite detailed tables setting out what was in the draft and subsequently what was changed as a result of discussions on the assessment side.  What has been important to us as we have gone through the past two and a half years is we have worked very closely with the consultants and the relevant advisory bodies across government on the question of making sure the facts we consider through the SEA and LEA processes are built in to the plan and the documents as they evolve.<\/p> <p>  It was the case we had fairly constructive but challenging conversations with our contractors throughout to make sure we were compliant, accounting for best available information, considering the policies in the round, etc.  Off the top of my head I cannot point to one big issue I can say was the big change as a result of the assessments, but the assessments probably touched on and resulted in influence over most policies in most of the chapters.  There were what seemed like small changes to the wording, but that had quite a significant impact on the way they are read and the way they will end up being applied.  In particular, it was about ensuring where the environment needs to be accounted for in a particular way is articulated in policies where that is relevant.  The Deputy will see in the introduction we have also built into supporting text a large signpost to ensure the relevant environmental assessments are accounted for properly in decision-making.  It was about making sure the NMPF reflects that.<\/p> <p>  That is a brief overview of the impact of the assessment process, but because it has been incremental throughout the process, it has had a significant influence.

It sets out that in doing so, the relevant spatial articulation in the plan may account for interests, and there is a big list outlined.  As set out in the note circulated to the committee ahead of the meeting, we have attempted, where possible, to provide spatial information related to activities in the plan.  The Marine Institute, MI, has been instrumental in providing us with the best available information on that.  There are a number of policies that apply just in specific areas and therefore they are considered spatial in that sense.  What we have done is make sure, where we can, that we have tied policies to particular spatial areas.  Ones I often cite in this are ports, harbours and shipping and the various marine side of things.<\/p> <p>  We have also been sensitive to understanding that stakeholders did not want us to go fully spatial across all plan areas.  We have also taken a strategic approach across many of the policies.<\/p><p>The majority of them apply over the whole plan area.  It is on a matter-specific basis as to which policies are most relevant in a particular case, be it a specific area or topic being considered.  In terms of compliance, therefore, I believe we have spatially articulated the marine activities in Ireland's maritime area through the plan and, where possible, we have set out policy attached to said areas.  If a person is coming to that, however, and looking at compliance as being that everything should be provided by the zone then that is not the way we have looked at complying with that article.  We have not gone down that route.

I would like to make two more points, one of which is on the marine protected areas, as the Deputy mentioned again.  It would probably be worthwhile for the committee to invite those in those responsible for marine protected areas to appear before it at some stage to get their take on it and finalise their plan.  I really cannot speak on their behalf on this only to point to the ongoing public consultation.<br\/><br\/>The second point is to amplify what Mr. Woolley said about the spatial designation process.  When I appeared before the committee prior to Christmas regarding what is now called the maritime area planning Bill, we discussed strategic marine activity zones.  That has changed somewhat.  We have reflected on what the committee had to say about issues like that.  Our thinking in discussions across government is that those are now changing to designated maritime area plans, DMAP, and will be referred to when the Bill comes to the committee in the next few weeks.  They will be more focused on the plan itself as opposed to the zone they are in.  Our thinking was that a zone is not anything without a plan for that area.  The plan itself then will have full public participation at every level, both at proposal level and ahead of any plan being finalised.  The Oireachtas will be the proper body for approving those final plans each time.<br\/><br\/>The draft copy of this final version of the NMPF, which members have received, did not contain maps.  Each chapter, however, has a number of detailed maps that are related to the activity that chapter is about, which display what is happening and where around the coast.  We are also developing a tool that will be launched later in the summer, however, called the marine special planning digital tool.  I am going to invite my colleague, Ms Fitzpatrick, to discuss that now.  This will be a public-facing spatial tool in the format of <i>Myplan.ie <\/i>but for the sea, which will allow users to see what is happening and where.  That is something we are going to build on over the next decade to include as much, if not all, marine activities in order that all end users and the public can have a visual display of what is going on around the maritime area.

There are two stages to this digital tool.  The initial one will, as Mr. McCabe and Mr. Woolley have mentioned, be based on the maps that are in the national marine planning framework.  The maps are physical items in the NMPF, which are static and will not change.  As the maps are updated, we will update them on the digital tool, so that the public can access it and see anything that has changed.  One will be able to use the digital tool, draw a polygon shape over whatever area one is interested in, and it will identify what maps and layers in the policies are relevant to that area.  Planners will also be able to look at that.<\/p> <p>  We plan to develop the tool, as Mr. McCabe mentioned, from what it will be this summer to what it will be in a year or two.  It will be integrated across the board and it will be open to all Departments and all local authorities.  We will eventually use one centralised application so that it reduces duplication across the board.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan asked about the maps on it.  Some of the changes relate to ports, harbours and shipping, as Mr. Woolley mentioned.  It was suggested to us that we might look to put that in.  The public feedback has been good, as has the feedback from our stakeholders' advisory group.<\/p> <p>  We asked the Marine Institute to read the legislation about ports and harbour districts, come up with some grid reference points for those, go to the various ports and ensure that what it had was accurate.  We now have a new map which will show those limitations.  We are also open to any other sectors that have maps of interest that want to come to us and tell us what they are.  Once they are verified, we can put them on the tool.  It is all open data, so it is open to anyone who has a system to download this data, very much like one currently can on the Department's open data website.  It covers sectoral interests and hobby interests, so if someone wants to go surfing and wants to know where the best place to do it is, he or she will be able to use this tool.<\/p> <p>  We want all of Ireland to use our tool as the first place for this.  It is not just governmental institutions that should be doing this, but everybody, which is what we want here.  If one wants to see all the shipwrecks around Ireland, it is really interesting to look at, and one will be able to see all of those shipwrecks.  As marine protected areas come on stream, we will be able to update this map.  It will be up to date.  Once the plan is printed, it does not change, but the idea with the digital tool is that it will be innovative and will be there for the public, developers and planners to use.  We hope that it will be simple, intuitive and easy for people to use.  At the next consultation, we will look for more input about what else we can put into the tool.  Development will go on further.  We will have the Twitter feed and email address on it so that people can contact us with anything that they feel would be relevant.  We are happy to look at anything like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021040600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Juliet Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fitzpatrick.

It is helpful for us to navigate through this.  I will pick up on an answer that Mr. Woolley gave to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan about changes.  One of the submissions to the consultation was from the Environmental Protection Agency.  It had some quite strong concerns about the weakness of the existing environmental baseline.  There was some uncertainty around measures to provide mitigation for activities that might have negative environmental impacts and also concerns about monitoring or enforcement.  Mr. Woolley might address this verbally if possible, or if it is not possible, then write to us at a later stage, and state to what extent he thinks the final draft has addressed those kinds of concerns.  I am keen to further interrogate the interaction between the marine plan and the retitled marine area planning Bill.<\/p><p>It would be good to get an update from the Department on when it expects to publish that Bill and bring it back to the House.  How do the strategic marine activity zones, SMAZs, in particular, interact with the provisions of the planning framework?  I know I sound like a broken record but in the absence of a marine protected area designation, would it not be sensible to insist on sensitivity mapping in advance, and as part, of the ministerial decision on the SMAZ process?<\/p><p> I want to pick up again on Senator Seery Kearney's question on upskilling.  There is a big job of work for our planning authorities, both the local authority and the board, if we take it that the marine is ten times the size of our terrestrial landmass.  Can the Department give us more information on the plan for training and staff recruitment, particularly in those areas where we expect, for example, significant wind farm projects to be progressed at the early stages?  How will all of that be dealt with?  Will the Department give us more detail on how this plan will interact with, and the time scales for, both the regional and local plans?  It seems some of the details certain coastal communities and inshore fisher associations have are concerned with the implications of this plan for the development of their more local plans.<\/p><p> I have a few more questions which I will put in either this round or the next round, depending on whether I have more time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021040600002#N00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions and I will answer them along with my colleagues.  I will give an update on the Bill.  As the Deputy knows, I am responsible for the Bill.  I do not have a firm or fixed date for when the Bill will come to the committee.  We will be looking to publish it in the coming weeks and I hope it will not be too long after that when it gets to Committee Stage.  We are looking at a matter of weeks and not months.  As the Deputy knows, we received the report from the committee in mid-February.  We have gone through that and I am happy to say we have been able to incorporate in the Bill a lot of the committee's recommendations.  Hopefully the committee will be surprised by that.  It is a more robust Bill as a result, and as a result of discussions we have had with other stakeholders.  All I can say at this stage is that we will be looking to publish it in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  SMAZs have been removed from the Bill.  There will no reference to SMAZ  and we have replaced that with designated maritime area plans, DMAPs.  The Minister is the competent authority for construction and marine spatial plans in the maritime area.  Under the Bill, which is subject to change as it goes through the Oireachtas process, the Minister will be able to designate another competent authority to create a DMAP.  That could be a local authority creating a forward plan within its nearshore area, for instance, or it could be for another Minister to create an offshore spatial plan anywhere in the maritime area.  We are building the process for the creation of those DMAPs and trying to set it in legislation.  Broadly speaking, it will take the form of public consultation and public participation on the proposal ahead of finalisation.  As part of that finalisation process, those maritime area DMAPs will come before the Oireachtas for comments and approval, presumably before this committee, in the same way this spatial plan is coming before this committee and the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  We have reflected on the recommendations of the committee and one of its recommendations was the importance of public participation in all elements.  We have taken that, reflected on it and created a more robust process that with which I hope members will be happy.  I think they will be because more public participation is better in this regard.<\/p><p>That will be enhanced by environmental assessments on those plans.

One was on our baseline report and that informed and provided the information for the draft NMPF.  We then publicly consulted on the draft NMPF and that has resulted in the version before members.  In several responses, people referred to the absence of environmental information they saw in the baseline report.  We have fully addressed that in the draft by incorporating a quite substantial new environmental section.  Between the draft and the version members have now, we have substantially improved our approach to environmental policy.  We worked closely with our marine environment colleagues in the Department to ensure we have an MSFD-led approach, focusing on how the NMPF can ensure the good environmental status targets that have been established under the marine statutory framework directive, MSFD, steer the environment policy that sits in the plan.<\/p> <p>  To do that, we have had to look at some hefty technical material to ensure it is carried over appropriately.  We do not want to over-regulate by saying things that are already in place and including measures that are already under way.  We looked quite closely at the marine statutory framework directive Article 17 update Ireland's marine strategy part 1 report published last June.  In terms of timing, this plan has had to react in quite an agile way to many things that have been happening, this latest on the MSFD being one.  The level of detail can be seen, as can also how we have been able to integrate with the MSFD process, which has been quite a substantial change between the draft and the current version.  We hope that alignment will both update significantly the information we are able to provide for people and ensure it is aligned to initiatives already under way in the marine environment side.  Also, we hope that by doing that, the role of the NMPF in the marine environment is clear.  As a result of the process of updating the marine environment side of things, we have looked to bodies such as the EPA to ensure we are pulling in evidence where we can.  The Marine Institute has also helped us to do that and spot things that perhaps we ought to bring in and so on.<\/p> <p>  I hope the marine environment side is based on the best available information and we are providing it in the plan.  As with other areas, it is a continually evolving field.

Our plan would be for two phases of sub-national planning.  Again, there is no end point for these as they are recurring things.  We will have regional plans which, from what we have heard from the public consultations, is what people want.  Maybe that is because that is what they are familiar with but that is what we will be looking at.  There will probably be three regional plans with one for each of the sea areas, that is, the east coast, the south coast and the Atlantic-facing coast.  When we get down to the nitty-gritty it will be at local area level.  The legislation is broad enough that we can create plans that might cover a few local authorities, or a smaller plan could cover one local authority.<\/p> <p>  Something we also want to roll out over the next year is pilot coastal partnerships.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin was asking about this as well and about how locals can influence marine planning.  I will just speak about one of those coastal partnerships.  I would hope to take a bay area such as Clew Bay or Bantry Bay, where there is a lot of good work happening already, and create local advisory groups that would take ownership of the marine planning process, feed into it and, in some ways, direct it.  That should be carried out through the local authority and elected members should have a lot of influence over those groups.  That would really put shape on what type of forward plan those areas will have over the next ten to 20 years.  We will take that back up and do our best to implement it in that manner.  A lot of this will be new.

It is also in line with the policy approach taken in the NMPF.  The supporting material makes reference to a number of ongoing initiatives in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, MSFD, but also within Ireland to look at the issue of different litter sources.  However the principle remains the same, in that we should apply a waste hierarchy approach no matter what industry is involved or what the source of litter might be.

To be clear, my proposition at the start was for something similar to pre-legislative scrutiny.  While it is the case that pre-legislative scrutiny is carried out on Bills, section 73 of the Planning and Development Act, the relevant section for dealing with this plan, provides that Oireachtas committees can compile reports and the Minister has to have regard to those reports.  My idea was that we might hold a second hearing, at which we invite in some other stakeholders to give their views, and we may or may not as a committee want to give our views to the Minister in the form of a report.<\/p> <p>  The more I listen, the more some of the concerns I had at the outset are coming back.  They are similar concerns to those I had when we were dealing with the marine planning and development management Bill.  This is not in any way to question either the large volume of work or effort of the officials but rather to tease out some of these matters.  Part of my concern is that on the one hand, we have an urgent need for large-scale offshore wind energy production and a range of a products that are champing at the bit and ready to go.  We all want those projects to be up and running and we all want that renewable energy.  The fact that we are so far behind on the marine protected areas, however, that our environmental baseline information is still not where we would like it to be in terms of impacts and state of play for various marine species, and even the fact we are talking about coastal partnerships but they are small or limited in number, suggests we could end up in a position in which none of us wishes to be, where we end up having a conflict between large-scale industrial development of offshore wind, on the one hand, and the protection of our marine environment and smaller scale coastal communities, on the other.  The attempt to avoid that is what many of us are raising here.<\/p> <p>  One of the questions I asked earlier related to monitoring and enforcement, as one of the other criticisms or concerns the EPA had raised.  Given that fisheries and aquaculture are still dealt with by a separate Department, albeit in the context of this plan, we could again have those inevitable tensions between larger scale industrial fishing and aquaculture and smaller inshore fishing communities and their economic viability.  That is something we need to avoid.<\/p> <p>  I am still concerned that the three legs of this stool, namely, the marine protected area legislation, the marine planning and development management Bill and the marine planning framework, are not all visible to us at the same time, although, obviously, they all sit within the architecture of the relevant EU directives.<\/p><p>For those of us who are not experts in this area or do not have the long experience of the departmental officials, it is difficult trying to read where the document before us sits alongside one Bill that has been substantially revised and we have not seen, and another Bill that we do not know when we will get to see, particularly given that we are meant to have an ecosystems-led approach to this spatially and temporally.  For non-experts, putting all of that together is tough.<\/p><p> I am concerned by the issue of mapping and the information we are getting on same.  The suggestion seems to be that it is a lagging indicator responding to developments rather than what many of us understand mapping to be in the context of county development plans, where we would set out clearly in mapping what was open for consideration in any part of the terrestrial space and planning authorities would then make decisions on whether space was mixed use, residential or commercial.  I find it difficult to understand how a competent planning authority could make informed decisions, in particular about the impact of certain kinds of industrial activity on precarious marine ecosystems, without the necessary information.  I appreciate that some of these issues are not the responsibility or fault of the people from the Department who are giving us this briefing, but we must take them into account.  I am still minded that we need further committee scrutiny or whatever we call it, although I hear the point clearly that this process cannot drag on and must be time limited.<\/p><p> Could we have more information on the point about monitoring enforcement that the EPA raised?  I am interested in the timeline for the upskilling of our planning authorities, given the complexity of the decisions that they will be making.  I am intrigued by how the planning framework interacts with the licensing of aquaculture and fisheries.  I am sure that the Department would informally prefer all of these matters to be dealt with by a single lead Department, but will the witnesses talk us through how the framework interacts with the current division of responsibilities between their Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?<\/p><p> We have been discussing the plan's spatial nature a great deal, but it must also be a temporal plan that considers future uses.  Given the negative impacts of some activities on our marine ecosystems, will one of the witnesses talk through in the simplest terms possible for us lay people the plan's key temporal aspects and how they interact with the spatial aspects?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021040600002#T00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I did not catch the section of the Act to which the Deputy referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021040600002#U00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1617663600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Section 73(2) of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021040600002#U00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1617663600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.

We have many irons in the fire in terms of how we will roll out marine spatial planning, one of which is an offshore renewable energy and seafood working group, which we hope to get off the ground in the next few weeks.  It will bring together representatives from the offshore wind energy industry as well representatives from the aquaculture and sea-fishing industries to create a communications protocol that we are planning will serve as a template for how those groups will communicate with one another in future so that fishers are not left out of the decision-making process and they know exactly what is happening with development plans in their areas or their areas of work.<\/p> <p>  The second leg of this four-legged stool is the maritime jurisdiction Bill, which will be before the Oireachtas in a couple of weeks.

We are looking at a target of 5 GW for offshore wind energy development off the east and south coasts by 2030.  To make this happen, we need certainty and stability which will be essential for triggering investments in wind energy projects.  The NMPF, together with the maritime area planning Bill, are going to be key to enabling the achievement of these goals.  The enactment of the legislation will allow us to move from the current decentralised, developer-led regime towards a much more plan-led regime.<\/p> <p>  On the process for the designation of MPAs, given our 2030 targets for offshore renewable energy and the long lead-in times for developing offshore wind projects, we are in a situation where the MPAs will not be designated in time for development of these projects.  We are liaising closely with the relevant officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to ensure decisions made over the coming years can be taken in the context of the best available data.<\/p> <p>  We have one offshore renewable energy development plan in place now.  It was published in 2014.  It assessed the capability of various zones around the entire coast to support the development of offshore renewable energy.  The strategic environmental assessment, SEA, that underpinned it found that 4.5 GW of offshore wind and 1.5 GW of wave and tidal energy generation could be developed in Irish waters in the period to 2030.  Since 2014, however, there have been significant developments in technologies.  We also have available to us now much richer data sets.  Accordingly, the Department is undertaking a complete review of the offshore renewable energy development plan.  To do this, we are carrying out an assessment of what data are out there and what gaps exist.  Once we identify these, we will start modelling to identify areas suitable for future offshore renewable energy development plans.

Each type of designation is focused on a particular thing.  We have provided the information on especially important species, including cetaceans, which are whales and dolphins.  We have provided the same for habitats.  We have drawn on the most up-to-date data, working with other parts of government to make sure we have included that in the plan so people can get a snapshot of what is there.
