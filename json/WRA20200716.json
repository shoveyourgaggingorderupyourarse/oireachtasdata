EU GDP is projected to shrink by around 8&frac14; per cent, while global GDP (excluding the EU) is expected to contract by 3.9 per cent this year.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that we are in the midst of a deep global recession and the Commission's forecasts reflect this.  In response, policy support has been scaled-up in most countries, on both the monetary and fiscal fronts.  While very high frequency data suggest that the low-point has been passed and that a gradual recovery is setting in as restrictions ease, the level of uncertainty regarding the path for the global economy is exceptionally high, not least because of the uncertain path of the virus.<\/p>  <p>  From an Irish perspective, the Commission expects real GDP to contract by 8&frac12; per cent this year, with growth of 6&frac14; per cent next year.  My Department set out its spring forecasts in the Stability Programme Update which was published in April.  GDP is projected to contract by 10.5 per cent this year, with a partial recovery expected next year. <\/p>  <p>  In response, the Government has allowed a large deficit to open - the operation of the so-called automatic stabilisers - and supplemented this with significant discretionary policies designed to boost healthcare capacity, support household incomes and maximise the firm survival rate.  <\/p>  <p>  A general government deficit of between &euro;23 and &euro;30 billion is in prospect for the year.  The scale and scope of the Government's response has been in line with that of other European countries; indeed, the Government will bring forward additional measures shortly.<\/p>  <p>  It is entirely appropriate that Government runs a deficit to support the economy in these unprecedented circumstances.  However, borrowing at this scale cannot go on indefinitely and, once circumstances allow, we will need to bring public expenditure and revenue back into balance.  This can be achieved through economic recovery (which automatically boosts tax receipts as people spend more, etc.) and re-normalising public expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stability and Growth Pact","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[15669\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an indication has been received from the EU based on the Stability and Growth pact report forwarded to the EU in April 2020 regarding the likely borrowing that will be permitted to Ireland in 2021 to reboot the economy after the Covid-19 crisis; if the EU has not given this indication, when it is likely to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>As outlined in the Stability Programme Update, published by my Department in April, the so-called &lsquo;general escape clause&rsquo; of the Stability and Growth Pact was activated for the first time in March of this year.

This decision was taken to allow Member States to take all necessary measures in response to COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  Along with suspending the fiscal adjustments recommended by the European Council for 2020, the general escape clause also underpinned the Country-Specific Recommendation issued in respect of budgetary policy for 2021. Specifically, in contrast to the regular procedures under the Stability and Growth Pact, no quantitative fiscal requirement or target was prescribed for Member States in relation to 2021. Instead, Member States are recommended to take all necessary measures to effectively address the pandemic, sustain the economy and support the ensuing recovery. Therefore, the EU's fiscal rules do not currently seek to place a limit on Ireland's borrowing in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, it is important to stress that Ireland entered this crisis from a position of strength, with effective full employment conditions and improving debt dynamics. The composition of our debt also remains favourable with long maturities and strong credit ratings.

This Government will prioritise reform of the insurance sector with particular emphasis on motor, public liability, and employer liability insurance.  This is recognised in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which I believe builds and expands upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  <\/p>  <p>  By way of further information, the Programme for Government lays out commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance; increasing transparency; addressing legal reforms in certain areas of civil law; addressing fraud; enhancing and reforming the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and increasing competition.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of reform, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council by 28 October. These guidelines have a role to play in the lowering of award levels and ensuring a more consistent application of making awards in courts.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is also important to recognise that there is no single policy or legislative to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue.  There are also many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address it, in particular the fact that it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied, or direct insurance companies as to their pricing levels.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that insurance reform remains a priority for the Government and as noted above this is reflected in the Programme for Government.  This is an issue I, as Minister for Finance, along with my Departmental colleague, Minister of State Chambers, are already focusing on.  In doing so we will be cooperating with our Ministerial colleagues that will be participating in the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment in terms of prioritising the commitments on insurance reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA02100"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[16299\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an extension of the temporary wage subsidy scheme will be considered for sectors and employers that continue to be affected by public health measures; his plans to discontinue, modify or taper payments under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[16292\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to reform the temporary wage subsidy scheme into a short-term work and training scheme akin to the German Kurzarbeit model; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[16275\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the operation of the temporary wage subsidy scheme will be examined in order that it is available to persons whose work is seasonal and increases in the summer months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[15815\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the temporary wage subsidy scheme will be modified to allow employers to avail of same for seasonal workers moving from part-time to full-time hours during peak season (details supplied).","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19, 62 and 64 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced in March and was specifically designed to support firm viability and preserve the relationship between the employer and employee insofar as is possible through the lockdown period, in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business had been negatively impacted by COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that this economy-wide scheme was developed in a very short period of time having regard to the overarching urgent Government objective of getting assistance to employers and employees as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Since it was introduced, over 50,000 firms have availed of the scheme (which is almost a third of all employers from 2019).

In this context, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of mortgage applications, lenders continue to process applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19.

However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework governing the provision of mortgages, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit, is a commercial and contractual decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the regulations governing mortgage credit, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, require lenders to make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  The Regulations further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower and in this regard I welcome the recent statement from the pillar banks that they will assess mortgage applications from people in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy scheme on a case by case basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[16312\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to introduce a tax on net wealth exceeding &euro;1 million in order to fund public investment.","asker":"1628","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax.

In general, the reduced rate of VAT (13.5%) currently applies to accommodation, certain recreational activities and supplies of food and drink in restaurants, excluding alcohol and soft drinks.  <\/p>  <p>  Under EU VAT law, Member States may only have two reduced rates which cannot be higher than 15% and no lower than 5%.

In order to introduce a new reduced rate, one of the current reduced rates would have to be removed. In general, the VAT rate on accommodation, certain recreational services, such as amusement parks, fairgrounds, cinemas, etc., can be reduced to a rate no lower than 5%. The provision of food and drink in restaurants can also be reduced to a rate no lower than 5%.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive, also maintains several standstill provisions and derogations that allows it to maintain reduced rates, zero rates and exemptions to certain supplies for historical reasons.

Credit unions account for approximately one third of the consumer credit market and are well positioned to provide credit to support the recovery.  <\/p>  <p>  Policy Review <\/p>  <p>  The economic outlook arising by virtue of COVID-19, including reduced demand for new lending, has increased the challenges the sector is already facing. As a result it was agreed that the Credit Union Advisory Committee would report to me on challenges and opportunities for the sector, incorporating implications of COVID-19, and any relevant recommendations. I understand that this report is complete and will be submitted to me in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  There are several commitments in Programme for Government which relate to credit unions, which will be expanded upon in the coming weeks and months by the new Government, taking into account work already completed such as the CUAC report noted above and a separate CUAC report on directors which was finalised in February 2020.  I will also take into consideration the views of key stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Levies &amp;amp; Charges<\/p>  <p>  The sector pays four material levies and charges.  Three of these levies &ndash; Deposit Guarantee Scheme, Resolution and Stabilisation &ndash; are used to build up funds, that are available to protect members savings. The fourth levy is an Industry Funding Levy set by the Central Bank to offset the cost of regulation.  <\/p>  <p>  Industry Funding Levy <\/p>  <p>  Since 2004, the amount of the Industry Funding Levy payable by a credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of its total assets as at 30 September of the previous year. The balance of regulatory costs has been funded by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1942 (as amended). <\/p>  <p>  The cost of regulating the credit union sector has increased over recent years with the emergence of the necessity to increase the intensity of supervision of this sector. In 2018, the credit union sector contributed &euro;1.7 million (circa 9% of the total costs incurred in regulating the sector). <\/p>  <p>  During 2019, I approved the Central Bank request to recover 50% of credit union costs on a phased basis, starting with a 20% recovery rate for the 2019 levy (levied in 2020), moving to 35% in 2020 (levied in 2021) and to 50% in 2021 (levied in 2022). <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Central Bank's request, I also recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until: 1) the levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and 2) a public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector. <\/p>  <p>  Given that all other financial services sectors are at, or moving towards, 100% recovery, the move towards 50% in respect of credit unions, with further increases at that time being subject to consultation and Ministerial approval, is measured and takes account of the role that credit unions play in Irish society. Exemptions from levies result in a burden on the tax-payer through state subvention.<\/p>  <p>  Resolution &amp;amp; Stabilisation Levy<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, held a public consultation in 2019 on potential changes to the Resolution Fund Levy. Following this review, I announced on 1 October 2019 a reduction in the levy rate which will result in a reduction of &euro;4 million per annum from &euro;9 million in 2019 to &euro;5 million from 2020, or 44% reduction.   <\/p>  <p>  Both the Resolution and Stabilisation levies for 2021 will be reviewed by me in advance of completion of the statutory instruments this autumn.  <\/p>  <p>  Lending <\/p>  <p>  Credit unions already have the ability to improve their loan to asset ratio, including through additional consumer lending, mortgage and SME lending, either individually or through collaborative efforts. <\/p>  <p>  The sector currently has capacity to lend an additional &euro;1.1 billion for mortgage and SME lending collectively, with further additional lending capacity available to credit unions which can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As at end 2019, credit unions had a mortgage and SME loan book of approximately &euro;300 million. <\/p>  <p>  Following a review and public consultation, the Central Bank issued revised regulations setting out new lending measures for credit unions which came into effect on 1 January 2020. These regulations removed the previous lending maturity limits which capped the percentage of credit union lending which could be outstanding for periods of greater than 5 and 10 years. The maturity limits have been replaced by new concentration limits, on a tiered basis, for house and business loans, expressed as a percentage of total assets. These changes have increased the ability of individual credit unions to manage the composition of their loan books and provide those credit unions with the financial strength, the competence and the capability, the flexibility to undertake increased longer term lending, including home mortgage and business lending.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government's COVID-19 supports, it is proposed to revise the Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS). The scheme is a Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation (DBEI) scheme, operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), and is already available for banks, non-banks and credit unions to participate in, subject to certain conditions. Officials from DBEI, SBCI and my Department have been and will be available to discuss the CGS and other State financing supports with banks, non-banks and credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  Regulatory Reserves <\/p>  <p>  Adequate reserves (capital) support a credit union&rsquo;s operations, provide a base for future growth and protect against the risk of unforeseen losses. The minimum regulatory reserve to be maintained by all credit unions under Central Bank regulations is 10% of the assets of the credit union, a level which was set following the last financial crisis. Credit unions had average reserves of 16% as at December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank informs me that the current reserve requirement for credit unions is a reflection of a number of factors including: <\/p>  <p>  - available sources of reserves (retained earnings); <\/p>  <p>  - the need for individual credit unions to have the capacity to absorb potential losses; and<\/p>  <p>  - the business model currently operated by credit unions, which is predominantly focused on the provision of short-term personal lending. <\/p>  <p>  In setting the minimum regulatory reserve requirement, the Central Bank are mindful of the financial resilience of the sector, members confidence and the protection of members' funds.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note, however, that one of the &ldquo;Additional Observations&rdquo; contained in a 2019 Peer Review Report of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Performance of its regulatory functions in relation to credit unions - undertaken by the International Credit Union Regulators&rsquo; Network (ICURN) - suggests that the Registry of Credit Unions conduct additional stress-testing on regulatory reserves under the existing leverage ratio and risk-weighted reserve approach. The Registry of Credit Unions has advised me that it will consider this suggestion as it plans its work around implementation of the Peer Review Team&rsquo;s recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the Central Bank also informs me that introducing a risk weighted approach could place a disproportionate burden on individual credit unions involving a requirement for system enhancements to calculate the required detail and a level of new\/additional expertise with associated cost implications. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":50,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA04900"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[16315\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether claims by banks here that they must charge interest on 80,000 mortgage loans during payment holidays has been undermined by new guidance from European regulators; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[16289\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action he plans to take to address the accrual of interest on mortgage payment breaks; his views on the Central Bank and European Banking Authority advice relating to the charging of interest on mortgage payment breaks; if he plans to pass legislation to prevent the charging of interest during mortgage payment breaks in line with other EU countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 34 together.<\/p><p>The Members of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland introduced the payment break for their customers on 18 March last. These payment breaks were agreed quickly to provide substantial and rapid relief to worried and anxious borrowers, including mortgage holders, in situations where income has been directly impacted by COVID-19, and during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis. At the end of June, almost 160,000 payment breaks have been approved for Irish borrowers, representing &euro;20.1 billion of loans.<\/p><p>Given pre-existing EBA guidelines on the classification of default, the BPFI and its members sought to ensure that its payment break would not lead to the classification of loans as being non-performing. <\/p><p>Two weeks later, on 2 April, the EBA published Guidelines. These guidelines set out the criteria that payment moratoria must meet in order to benefit from supervisory flexibility and for them to not automatically lead to the loans being classified as forborne. <\/p><p>The key paragraph in relation to the charging of interest, paragraph 24, was interpreted in different ways across Europe.  It states that:<\/p><p>&quot;The moratorium changes only the schedule of payments. This condition is consistent with the objective of the moratorium to address the systemic short-term liquidity shortages. In order to achieve this objective, the moratoria suspend, postpone or reduce the payments (principal, interest or both) within a limited period of time. This clearly affects the whole schedule of payment and may lead to increased payments after the period of the moratorium or an extended duration of the loan. However, the moratorium should not affect other conditions of the loan, in particular the interest rate, unless such change only serves for compensation to avoid losses which an institution otherwise would have due to the delayed payment schedule under the moratorium, which would allow the impact on the net present value to be neutralised.&quot; <\/p><p>Banks across Europe interpreted the above paragraph in different ways with the results that different schemes were introduced.  Some countries provided for the accrual and capitalisation of the interest.  Others provided for the non-accrual and a number provided for accrual of the interest but not its capitalisation.<\/p><p>In its letter to Deputy Doherty on 22 June last, the Central Bank stated that the EBA was expected to provide further clarity on the specific issue of interest accrual and, I assume in light of the discussions then underway with the EBA, the Central Bank outlined that both the charging and non-charging of interest is acceptable under the guidelines. <\/p><p>The European Banking Authority duly provided clarifications in its implementation report on the 7th of July.  It confirmed in relation to the net present value or NPV of a loan that: <\/p><p><i>&quot; There may be a decline in the NPV if &hellip;. no interest is charged for the time covered by the moratorium. Alternatively, the moratorium may be NPV-neutral (i.e. no change in the NPV) if subsequently at least one of the instalments is adjusted upwards or added.&quot;<\/i><\/p><p>The EBA also confirmed that its guidelines on the classification of default did not apply to loans on a payment break under a general moratorium.  The BPFI payment moratorium complies fully with the EBA's Guidelines because it is NPV-neutral.<\/p><p>Finally, the Government and the Central Bank of Ireland have stated that it is essential that lenders fully explain the implications, including any associated cost or other significant impacts, of the particular payment break measures being put in place.  For instance, lenders should outline if the repayment term of the mortgage will be extended due to the payment break, if monthly payments will increase following the resumption of the mortgage repayments, if interest will continue to accrue during the payment break and the implications this will have for the total cost of the credit, and any other significant matter for the customer when availing of a Covid-19 payment break, or indeed for any other reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth Rate","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA05300"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[16228\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600053#WRA05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the latest IMF World Economic Outlook forecasts and the implications for the fiscal position of the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>The IMF&rsquo;s World Economic Outlook (WEO) update signals a synchronised and deep contraction in global economic activity this year, with a gradual recovery next year.

","asker":"1569","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>I understand that the focus of the Deputy's question is about the approach for supporting both public and private operators in the public transport sector in relation to the challenges raised by the Covid-19 health emergency.<\/p>  <p>  Over the course of the COVID-19 crisis, my Department has been working closely with the National Transport Authority (NTA) to ensure public transport services continue safety and to plan for capacity as demand for public transport services changes along the course of the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  In this context, the NTA has been engaging directly with both public service obligation (PSO) and commercial transport operators.  My Department has also been also engaging directly with commercial bus operators to help inform policy decisions in relation to the public transport sector as we progress through the various phases of the Roadmap.  In relation to taxis and hackneys, there has also been direct engagement with the Taxi Advisory Committee who have since been reviewing the situation in relation to the small public service vehicles (SPSV) sector and I expect to consider the output of their work shortly.  In connection with all this, my Department has engaged intensively across Government in relation to progressing a wide range of relevant issues in relation to public transport, particularly focused on safety, capacity, and financial challenges.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the sharp decline in passenger numbers since mid-March this year as a result of the Covid-19 health emergency has caused an unprecedented fall in fare revenues, thus creating a wide gap between the operators' costs and actual revenues. This is putting acute pressure on the existing Public Service Obligation (PSO) budget. However, it is clear that public transport is an essential service and that it is an important facilitator of the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  We will ensure that this year's PSO is appropriately funded and my Department is working closely with the NTA to quantify the additional funding requirements for the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  From my Department's engagement with their representatives, and indeed from the NTA's regular engagement with them throughout the crisis, I understand the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing.  Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.<\/p>  <p>  It is critical for the public transport sector to be functioning so that it can carry the passengers that we need to return to work and to other activities as they re-open.  Many of these operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery.<\/p>  <p>  For that reason, the Deputy will be pleased to know that on 25 June the Government approved temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector.  These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering funding support through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.<\/p>  <p>  This is, of course, additional to the wider programme of Government supports for impacted businesses were introduced, including new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example.  In relation to SPSVs specifically, the NTA has also introduced a range of measures to facilitate their operation, and engaged with the insurance industry also on their behalf. <\/p>  <p>  With the commencement of Phase 3 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of bus and rail fleet. This will help to underpin public transport services provided by both public and commercial licensed operators during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport for the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to active travel the NTA has offered financial and technical support to all local authorities in order to deliver improved walking and cycling infrastructure across the country. The NTA&rsquo;s technical and financial support will be funded by my Department&rsquo;s sustainable mobility investment programme and will support delivery of measures such as:<\/p>  <p>  -  widening of footpaths to facilitate queuing outside shops and enable social distancing<\/p>  <p>  -  potential pedestrianisation of some streets where necessary and feasible to accommodate social distancing, particularly where this supports business activities<\/p>  <p>  -  potential one-way systems to create space for footpath widening<\/p>  <p>  -  altering traffic signal times to reduce pedestrian waiting\/crowding plus the automatic activation of some pedestrian phases in order to aid pedestrian movement and to minimise contact with signal push buttons<\/p>  <p>  -  providing additional temporary facilities for cyclists<\/p>  <p>  -  provision of some external space where appropriate to support business activities<\/p>  <p>  In view of all the existing necessary engagements to address the Covid challenges I have no plans, at this time, to establish an additional administrative structure in relation to Covid matters.         <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600054#WRB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600054#WRB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[16344\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600054#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a person (details supplied) can have their licence issued sooner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>The National Driver Licence Service has resumed its counter service for people applying for driving licences from 8 June, with revised working practices to keep its customers and staff as safe as possible.<\/p>  <p>  There is an inevitable backlog of people wishing to have a driving licence\/learner permit issued, and walk-in applicants are not admitted at the moment; appointments are required for everyone.<\/p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that a learner permit is not a licence, but a permit to allow a person to drive while learning.

Within that framework, it is the responsibility of the boards and management of individual banks to operate and manage their business in a way that meets and appropriately balances the requirements of the various stakeholders of banks and other financial entities.  <\/p>  <p>  As independent regulator of the banking and wider regulated financial services sector, the Central Bank is working with financial service providers to ensure that households and firms are protected throughout this Covid-19 period. This is an active and ongoing engagement. For example, for existing borrowers who are impacted by Covid-19 payment breaks on mortgages and SME loans, and other similar temporary relief measures, allow households and businesses to absorb the shock of the crisis, so that as many as possible can recover once the virus is under control. They will help households and businesses to preserve their liquid reserves today, to the extent possible, at the cost of higher repayments (or longer repayment periods) in the future. However, these measures do not come without cost to the banking sector and these costs will also have to be managed in a way that protects their business and will be as fair as possible to the various stakeholders.  However, as I have indicated to the banks, it will not be acceptable for banks to make excess profits from borrowers on payment breaks and it will be a matter for banks to demonstrate that situation will not arise.<\/p>  <p>  Lenders, including banks, voluntarily put in place payment breaks in March 2020 to support those borrowers that were financially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are available for all those that need them and are a suitable solution for.  Payment breaks are a widespread support being offered by lenders across the European Union and have been implemented on both a legislative and voluntary basis. The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued guidelines on their operation on 2 April 2020, with the aim of clarifying the regulatory treatment of payment moratoria across the EU prescribe the criteria which both voluntary and legislative moratoria must meet in order for relevant loans not to be classified as defaulted or otherwise forborne. Both interest accruing and interest not accruing are permissible under the guidelines and as a result the approach taken by Irish banks, whereby interest continues to accrue on exposures subject to the COVID-19 moratoria, is compliant with the EBA Guidelines.  All lenders also have been required to develop strategies and operational capability to continue to support borrowers who cannot return to full capital and interest after the end of the payment break and this may include offering forbearance as required and restructuring of loans in the event of long-term affordability issues.  In such a situation it should be noted that the provisions of the applicable Central Bank consumer protection codes and regulations will be available to borrowers in such a situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600054#WRB05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":145,"content":"<p>Question No. 62 answered with Question No. 18.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600054#WRB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[16278\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600054#WRB05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is considering a reduction in VAT on the hospitality and tourism sector in view of the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>The Government is fully aware of the unprecedented impact that the coronavirus is having on business and people&rsquo;s livelihoods.

In this context, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of mortgage applications, lenders continue to process applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The BPFI has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application. However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit, or temporarily suspend a mortgage approval in principle, is a commercial and contractual decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard.  Furthermore, a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown and, in such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[16318\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the actions he will take to stop banks charging interest on Covid-19 mortgage breaks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>The Members of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) introduced the payment break for their customers on 18 March last. These payment breaks were agreed quickly to provide substantial and rapid relief to worried and anxious borrowers, including mortgage holders, in situations where income has been directly impacted by COVID-19, and during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis. At the end of June, almost 160,000 payment breaks have been approved for Irish borrowers, representing &euro;20.1 billion of loans.<\/p>  <p>  Given pre-existing European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on the classification of default, the BPFI and its members sought to ensure that its payment break would not lead to the classification of loans as being non-performing. <\/p>  <p>  Two weeks later, on 2 April, the EBA published Guidelines. These guidelines set out the criteria that payment moratoria must meet in order to benefit from supervisory flexibility and for them to not automatically lead to the loans being classified as forborne. <\/p>  <p>  The key paragraph in relation to the charging of interest, paragraph 24, was interpreted in different ways across Europe.  It states that:<\/p>  <p>   \"The moratorium changes only the schedule of payments. This condition is consistent with the objective of the moratorium to address the systemic short-term liquidity shortages. In order to achieve this objective, the moratoria suspend, postpone or reduce the payments (principal, interest or both) within a limited period of time. This clearly affects the whole schedule of payment and may lead to increased payments after the period of the moratorium or an extended duration of the loan. However, the moratorium should not affect other conditions of the loan, in particular the interest rate, unless such change only serves for compensation to avoid losses which an institution otherwise would have due to the delayed payment schedule under the moratorium, which would allow the impact on the net present value to be neutralised.\" <\/p>  <p>  As I just mentioned, banks across Europe interpreted the above paragraph in different ways with the results that different schemes were introduced.  Some countries provided for the accrual and capitalisation of the interest.  Others provided for the non-accrual and a number provided for accrual of the interest but not its capitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  In its letter to Deputy Doherty on 22 June last, the Central Bank stated that the EBA was expected to provide further clarity on the specific issue of interest accrual and, I assume in light of the discussions then underway with the EBA, the Central Bank outlined that both the charging and non-charging of interest is acceptable under the guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  The EBA duly provided clarifications in its implementation report on the 7th of July.  It confirmed in relation to the net present value or NPV of a loan that: <\/p>  <p>  \" There may be a decline in the NPV if &hellip;. no interest is charged for the time covered by the moratorium. Alternatively, the moratorium may be NPV-neutral (i.e. no change in the NPV) if subsequently at least one of the instalments is adjusted upwards or added.\"   <\/p>  <p>  The EBA also confirmed that its guidelines on the classification of default did not apply to loans on a payment break under a general moratorium.  The BPFI payment moratorium complies fully with the EBA's Guidelines because it is NPV-neutral.    <\/p>  <p>  The Government and the Central Bank of Ireland have stated that it is essential that lenders fully explain the implications, including any associated cost or other significant impacts, of the particular payment break measures being put in place.  For instance, lenders should outline if the repayment term of the mortgage will be extended due to the payment break, if monthly payments will increase following the resumption of the mortgage repayments, if interest will continue to accrue during the payment break and the implications this will have for the total cost of the credit, and any other significant matter for the customer when availing of a Covid-19 payment break, or indeed for any other reason.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Central Bank that all lenders have been required to develop strategies and operational capability to continue to support borrowers who cannot return to full capital and interest after the end of the payment break. This will include offering forbearance as required and restructuring of loans in the event of long-term affordability issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":157,"content":"<p>Question No. 67 answered with Question No. 5.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC00900"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[16429\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects the proposed European Covid-19 rescue fund to be applied across the European Union; if it will be proportional to the extent to which each country has been affected by the virus in terms of economic and financial cost or by another mechanism; the degree to which this is likely to affect the case of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[16431\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to improve the case of Ireland in the context of likely benefit from the multibillion euro Covid-19 related rescue fund of the European Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 70 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, on 10 July 2020, the President of the European Council (PEC), Charles Michel, published revised proposals for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to run from 2021-2027 to be supplemented by a proposed temporary European recovery instrument &ldquo;Next Generation EU&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The total amount being proposed for the period 2021-2027 is &euro;1.824 trillion in commitments (2018 prices) - &euro;1.074 trillion for the MFF and &euro;750 billion for Next Generation EU.<\/p><p>Initial assessment of the Next Generation EU package and the national allocations announced suggest that Ireland, with an allocation of 0.4% may receive just over &euro;1.5 billion between 2021 and 2024 in grants topped up by a potential further &euro;1bn in loans from the facility should Ireland wish to apply.

The central scenario underpinning the SPU projections was one in which containment measures were assumed to remain in place for approximately three months, resulting in a very sharp contraction in the latter weeks of the first quarter and most of the second quarter. Thereafter, a very gradual recovery commencing in the third quarter was assumed reflecting a gradual easing of containment measures and the assumption that a vaccination is available before next year. There is likely to be some upside to these projections on the back of stronger than expected growth in the first quarter, and an earlier than expected re-opening as a result of the progress in suppressing the virus. As the economy continues to re-open, the extent of the recovery over the second half of this year and into next year will be a function of several factors, including the epidemiology of the virus, the success of containment measures, and the global economic outlook, of which there is considerable uncertainty.  <\/p>  <p>  At this stage it is clear that the economic impact of Covid-19 has not been the same across all sectors of the economy. Though the majority of economic activity has now resumed, it is likely that the services sector of the economy &ndash; much of which relies upon close physical interaction with consumers &ndash; has been and will continue to be the most severely impacted. In particular, activity in the retail, hotels, restaurants and arts sectors is likely to experience a severe decline as a result of being closed during the second quarter of the year. Though many of these businesses have reopened from the onset of Phase 3 on the 29th June, they will do so at reduced capacity to ensure compliance with public health guidelines. There may also be changes in consumer preferences due to concerns relating to virus transmission, resulting in lower demand for these services. The recovery in these sectors is therefore likely to be gradual and it is expected that aggregate economic activity will not reach its pre-COVID level until 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy response to the economic impact of the pandemic has been swift, including the introduction of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to cushion the blow to people&rsquo;s incomes and maintain the vital link between employers and employees, helping people to return to work as soon as possible once the worst of the crisis has passed. Indeed, in the forthcoming July Stimulus Package and the National Economic Plan, to be published alongside the Budget in October, the Government will demonstrate its commitment to bringing Ireland out of the worst of this economic downturn.

Part V was further amended by the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 to expand the activity of credit servicing, as defined in the Act, to include holding the legal title to credit granted under a credit agreement and associated ownership activities. <\/p>  <p>  Section 34FA(1) of the Act provides that a person carrying on the business of a credit servicing firm (insofar as that business relates to the newly regulated activities now falling within the scope of the Act) immediately before the commencement of the 2018 Act is taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm until the Central Bank has granted or refused authorisation to the person, provided that the person applies to the Central Bank under section 30 of the Act for authorisation, in a form specified by the Central Bank, no later than 3 months after that commencement. Persons seeking to avail of these transitional arrangements were  therefore required to have completed and submitted an application for authorisation to the Central Bank by 21 April 2019 in order to continue to engage in such activities. 37 firms were granted transitional authorisation status, having applied for authorisation by 21 April 2019 and demonstrated that they met the relevant requirements to avail of the transitional arrangements. Since that date, some firms ceased carrying out regulated activities and withdrew their application for authorisation. <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Central Bank that it has a robust authorisation process in place in which applicants will be required to demonstrate that they meet the Authorisation Requirements and Standards for credit servicing firms. Firms must be able to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they are capable of being supervised, that adequate and effective control of credit servicing takes place in the State and that they are in a position to conduct their affairs in a manner that ensures the best interests of consumers are protected. Factors to be considered in this regard include where the &lsquo;mind and management&rsquo; of the firm is located, where key decisions are made and where key functions are undertaken. Persons in senior positions in these firms will also be required to demonstrate that they comply with the Fitness and Probity Standards, the core function of which is to ensure that they are competent and capable, honest, ethical and of integrity and also financially sound.  Once the assessment phase of the authorisation process is completed, an applicant will either be granted or refused authorisation and the public register of credit servicing firms will be updated to reflect those firms who have been granted an authorisation.  <\/p>  <p>  While under consideration for authorisation, transitional credit servicing firms are subject to the full suite of consumer protection legislation, including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). They are also required to keep the existing associated authorised credit servicing firm in place until their application for authorisation is approved or refused.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of supervision, the Central Bank&rsquo;s strategy for supervising the credit servicing sector under the existing regulatory framework has a number of elements, including:<\/p>  <p>1. Detailed data gathering and analysis, including mortgage arrears and repossession data, such as the pattern of arrears in the Irish mortgage market by entity type; mortgage arrears profile; restructuring activity in the Irish market; data on alternative repayment arrangements and complaints etc. Additionally, obtaining direct evidence from consumers to provide first-hand information about their experiences in dealing with the sectors;<\/p>  <p>2. Intensified risk and evidenced-based supervision, which includes both on-site and offsite inspections, as appropriate. This includes  continuous assertive  supervision of credit servicing firms&rsquo; compliance with the CCMA, to ensure that a fair and transparent process is in place for all borrowers, including those whose loans have been sold; and <\/p>  <p>3. Use of their full suite of supervisory powers as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Currently the Central Bank is focused on ensuring the interests of borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are appropriately protected. Where a borrower is unable to repay their loan due to short-term financial difficulties caused by COVID-19, they have worked with regulated entities, including credit servicing firms, to make payment breaks available. In this regard, they have recently written to regulated entities, including credit servicing firms, setting out their expectations on how COVID-19 payment breaks should operate. A copy of which can be found here.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Central Bank advises me that its approach to the supervision of the credit-servicing sector is underpinned by an expectation of high standards and a professional and consumer-focused approach to compliance.<\/p>  <p>  Examples of some of the supervisory work the Central Bank has carried out in this regard includes:<\/p>  <p>1. In October 2018, in recognition of the fact that Irish banks, in common with their European counterparts, were increasingly opting for loan disposals (sales or securitisations) as a means of dealing with Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), the Central Bank published a Section 6A Report on the Effectiveness of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears in the context of the Sale of Loans by Regulated Lenders. Based on a point in time analysis and informed by various strands of work including inspections, data collection, and stakeholder engagement, the report found that for borrowers who engage with the process, the CCMA was working effectively and as intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders;<\/p>  <p>2. In August 2019, in the context of recent activity in the Irish residential mortgage market and evidence of some specific instances that could give rise to potential customer detriment, the Central Bank wrote to banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms to:<\/p>  <p>1. Set out their expectations of these regulated entities in relation to Mortgage Loan Transactions ; and<\/p>  <p>2. Seek assurances from the boards of these regulated entities (that are party to Mortgage Loan Transactions) that they have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the policies, procedures, systems and controls of the firm are sufficiently robust to ensure that consumer interests are protected; and <\/p>  <p>a. In October 2019, following an investigation by the Central Bank into the practice of charging costs associated with the legal process, including third party costs (the costs) to borrowers in mortgage arrears and charging of interest on the costs, the Central Bank wrote to banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms to:<\/p>  <p>b. Set out their expectations of these regulated entities in relation to charging costs and interest on the costs; and <\/p>  <p>c. Seek assurances from the boards of these regulated entities that where it was identified that any systems, policies, procedures and practices were not in line with the expectations outlined in the letter, appropriate action would be undertaken as a matter of priority.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[16449\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which he continues to engage with the pillar banks with a view to ensuring that their customers are treated in accordance with banking rules and regulations here and in the EU, with particular reference to the rates of interest charged to customers and the manner in which repossessions of family homes and-or commercial properties are governed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>As demonstrated by the recent meetings the T&aacute;naiste and I had with the main banks, the Government will continue to work with the banking industry, including the pillar banks, to see if any there are further appropriate measures that can be deployed to ensure that the banks can prudently, sustainably and as cost effectively as possible provide new credit to businesses and households.

The CCMA is a statutory Code, the provisions of which must be complied with as a matter of law by relevant firms.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, requiring relevant firms to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.<\/p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  <\/p>  <p>  An alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) is a contract that is entered into between the regulated entity and the borrower, and the process for arriving at the ARA is stipulated in the CCMA. Provision 39 of the CCMA requires that in order to determine which options for ARAs are viable for each particular case, a regulated entity must explore all of the options for ARAs offered by that regulated entity. A non-exhaustive list of ARA options which may be included in a regulated entity&rsquo;s suite is set out within this provision.  <\/p>  <p>  It is a commercial decision for each regulated entity to determine the suite of ARAs it considers putting in place for borrowers. Any ARA offered to a borrower must be appropriate and sustainable for his\/her individual circumstances. The Central Bank cannot interfere in the contractual rights between regulated entities and borrowers such that it could require a regulated entity to consider or put in place specific ARAs for borrowers. Rather, in regulating conduct of business, the Central Bank seeks to ensure that regulated entities comply with relevant conduct of business rules, including providing consumers with all relevant information, putting in place a process for the management of customers&rsquo; financial difficulties and not exerting undue pressure or influences on customers.<\/p>  <p>  This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his\/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession). <\/p>  <p>  The CCMA also requires regulated entities to have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower appeal a decision by a regulated entity, including where the borrower is not willing to enter into an ARA or where the regulated entity declines to offer an ARA.

The 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook recently ranked Ireland as the 2nd most competitive country in the EU and the 7th most competitive country in the world.  In addition, since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator had improved by approximately 25 per cent.  <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In 2019, average annual inflation was just 0.9 per cent. Inflation is forecasted to fall by 0.6 per cent in 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and is expected to only grow by 0.4 per cent in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  On wage developments, prior to COVID-19, average annual earnings increased by 3.6 per cent year-on-year in 2019. The current pandemic has shifted the focus from monitoring a potential acceleration in wages that could undermine Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness to ensuring household incomes are supported.  <\/p>  <p>  The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused adverse impacts, in particular on the labour market. However, there are no signs of a loss of competitiveness on international markets thus far. Trade has performed relatively well with the highest monthly level of exports and a record trade surplus recorded in March, caused by a boost in pharma exports. Another major exporting sector, computer services, recorded strong growth in Q1 2020 and is expected to perform well despite the outbreak of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  The recovery of the Irish economy is still uncertain, with numerous scenarios still possible. The National Economic Plan, which is due to be published alongside Budget 2021, will demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to bringing Ireland out of the worst of this economic downturn. Maintaining competitiveness will be an important part of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[16452\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600055#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the direction from which he expects to see the greatest challenges to the economy here in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>My Department continuously identifies and monitors possible risks to the Irish economy, and has outlined many of the key challenges that our economy faces in the recent Stability Programme Update (SPU) published in April.  <\/p>  <p>  Some of these key challenges and risks to the economy include, firstly, the risk that the slowdown in both domestic and global growth due to the impact of Covid-19 will become more prolonged, with the possibility of scaring effects in the labour market or a second resurgence of the virus which would mean a return of some containment measures. Indeed, the Covid-19 shock to the economy is without historical precedent and, as a result, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the both the magnitude of the economic impact and the subsequent economic recovery.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, a key external risk identified is the potential for the outcome of Brexit at the end of this year to be more severe than initially expected, with increased uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of the future trading relationship between the EU and the UK. <\/p>  <p>  Thirdly, continued and increasing geopolitical uncertainty has the potential to disrupt growth in key regions and generate headwinds for output and employment in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  A fourth key risk identified in the SPU is an increase in protectionism, including increased tariffs on EU-US trade, could have a detrimental impact on living standards. Given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further disruption to trade or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note however that as many of these risks to the economy are external in nature and largely beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. Indeed, in the forthcoming July Stimulus Package and National Economic Plan to be published alongside the Budget in October, the Government will demonstrate its commitment to bringing Ireland out of the worst of this current economic downturn.

In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS and the PUP are both subject to income tax. Payments under the TWSS are also subject to universal social charge (USC), while the PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and, thus, is exempt from that charge.  Payments under both schemes are exempt from PRSI charges.<\/p>  <p>  Neither PUP nor TWSS payments are taxed in real-time through the PAYE system, but a recipient of either payment may become liable for income tax and USC (for TWSS only) at the end of the year, which will be calculated by Revenue through the end of year review process.  <\/p>  <p>  In cases where the tax liability for those payments exceeds unused personal and PAYE tax credits for 2020, the level of tax and USC due by the person may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available to him or her at the end of the year.

Revenue has also very recently placed all recipients of TWSS payments or the PUP on what is known as the &ldquo;week 1 basis&rdquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that may arise at end year. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the final calculation of the end of year tax liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including the person&rsquo;s civil status, their available tax credits, the amount received under TWSS and\/or PUP, any top-up payments made by the employer, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses.  Revenue has also assured me that if any tax and USC liabilities still arise at end year following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue.  What is needed is for the ongoing reform measures to be implemented and to quickly bear fruit.  In this regard, the new Programme for Government identifies a range of issues that the Government will prioritise so as to benefit consumers including small businesses such as those in the leisure and entertainment sector as well as in the various community groupings and facilities throughout the country.

The planning system facilitates the regulation of such short-term letting uses undertaken by the individual carrying out the activity, i.e. the owner\/occupier of the house or apartment, rather than the online platforms. <\/p><p>The broader regulation of tourism activity, including the possible development of a new regulatory or licensing\/registration system for commercial platforms and short-term letting agents, was recommended in the final Working Group report on the regulation of short-term letting. The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future includes the specific action to strengthen the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms with regard to short-term lettings, and the approach in this regard will be considered over the coming months.<\/p><p>My Department has been in contact with each of the relevant local authorities in which RPZs are located throughout the year, and has requested regular updates on the enforcement and implementation of the Short Term Letting (STL) Regulations. Notwithstanding the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the workforce and workload of local authorities over recent months, as well as on the short-term letting market itself, this enforcement and implementation has continued to the extent possible. <\/p><p>From data available to the Department, I understand that up to the end of Q1 2020 the relevant local authorities have identified 1,757 properties which are suspected of being in breach of the STL Regulations, i.e. operating in RPZs without the appropriate permissions. As these cases are the subject of further investigation, it is not yet possible to confirm how many of these are definitively in breach of the statutory requirements. However, the local authority returns indicate that a total of 633 planning enforcement warning letters have been issued. The STL Regulations aim to ensure that properties in breach of the legislation cease to operate in the short-term letting sector, and do not facilitate the following up on the subsequent use of such properties, including the transfer of such properties into the long-term rental market. Accordingly, data regarding the subsequent use of the properties concerned is not available to my Department.<\/p><p>Under the STL Regulations, planning permission is required for the short-term letting of a room or rooms in a house that is not a person&rsquo;s principal private residence (house or apartment), or where the 90-day threshold for short-term letting of the entire home of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence is exceeded. Up to the end of Q1 2020, the local authority returns indicate that there were 47 change of use planning applications for these purposes received by local authorities, with two of these being granted.<\/p><p>Under the Regulations, the legal use of a property for home-sharing or short-term letting is not restricted solely to owner-occupiers, but can also be undertaken by those who are not the legal owner of the property, subject to the provision of the legal owner's consent. While a breakdown of owner-occupiers that have notified local authorities of their intention to engage in home-sharing is not available to my Department, I can confirm that 637 completed &quot;Form 15s&quot; have been received by local authorities. This form serves to register the property with the local authority and notify the local authority of the intention that the properties concerned will be legally used for home-sharing or short-term letting, within the limits set out in the legislation.<\/p><p>Below is a table providing the data requested and outlined above. <table>    <tr>       <th>Planning Authority<\/th>       <th>Total no of properties identified   as potentially in breach of the STL regulations<\/th>       <th>No of Form 15s (annual   notifications) received<\/th>       <th>No of STL change of use   planning applications received<\/th>       <th>No of STL change of use   planning permissions granted<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County<\/td>       <td>Return awaited<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DLR <\/td>       <td>46<\/td>       <td>99<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City <\/td>       <td>466<\/td>       <td>334<\/td>       <td>32<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal<\/td>       <td>825<\/td>       <td>59<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>31<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County<\/td>       <td>Return awaited<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>N\/A - areas only recently   designated as RPZs<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>100<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>43<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>159<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>21<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>N\/A - areas only recently   designated as RPZs<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>N\/A - areas only recently   designated as RPZs<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin <\/td>       <td>61<\/td>       <td>31<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>Return awaited<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>45<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow <\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>28<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>1757<\/td>       <td>637<\/td>       <td>47<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[16382\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to increase radically the income limits for eligibility for social housing in view of the fact many persons who will never be able to afford to purchase their own house are over the current income thresholds and are therefore caught in a housing poverty trap;

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. <\/p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. <\/p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p><p>There are a number of affordability measures to support people who wish to purchase their own homes. In particular, following a review of the previous two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL), was introduced with effect from 1 February 2018. The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  <\/p><p>As with previous local authority house purchase loan finance, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first time buyers only. This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources. <\/p><p>My Department publishes information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns for the RIHL. Local authority approval means that an official letter of offer has been sent to a borrower (and therefore relates to a specific property and loan amount). Information on the RIHL up to Quarter 4 2019, including in relation to the number and value of mortgage approvals and drawdowns and also average loan amounts, is available on my Department's website at the following link: <\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the availability of the Help To Buy Scheme for first-time-buyers offers additional assistance to purchasers of newly built properties. Up to 5% of the purchase price of properties below &euro;400,000 could be available, which represents a significant contribution towards these deposit requirements. This should alleviate some of the challenges faced by first-time buyers in accessing the 10% deposit of the market value of the property. The initiative has been designed to provide immediate and targeted support for first-time buyers in meeting their deposit requirements and encouraging the construction of new housing units. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Supports","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[16388\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 922 of 23 June 2020, the supports in place to assist families or individuals that may find themselves homeless and do not met the criteria to apply for housing supports via their local authority housing list (details supplied).","asker":"1520","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the statutory role of local authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Housing Act 1988 it is a matter for each local authority to determine whether a person is regarded as homeless; section 2 of the Act sets out the requirements in this regard.

The national retrofitting scheme will be managed by a newly designated National Retrofitting Delivery Body which is to be in place by the end of 2020.  Responsibility for the National Retrofitting Scheme rests with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment.  <\/p>  <p>  I am responsible for programmes that support energy efficiency renovations to local authority homes. My Department is providing funding support under the Social Housing Insulation Retrofitting Programme to local authorities since 2013, for insulation and energy efficiency works to their social housing stock.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme is implemented in two phases: Phase 1 is a shallow retrofit and ensures that the entire social housing stock has, as a minimum, cavity wall and attic insulation. Phase 2 is a deep retrofit and focuses on the fabric upgrade works to those dwellings with solid\/hollow block wall construction and also provides for replacement windows\/doors as well as heating upgrades (including upgrades to boilers, or a heat pump to replace the existing boiler).  To date &euro;151 million in Exchequer funding has been provided with over 72,000 social housing homes benefiting from upgrades.  Funding support will continue in 2020 for this programme from a budget of &euro;25 million, with local authorities selecting their properties for inclusion in the programme and determining the works that are necessary. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Just Transition proposals for the midlands region, Budget 2020 made provision for &euro;20 million to fund energy efficiency upgrades to local authority houses in the affected counties as a pilot programme. The programme is designed to explore an alternative approach to the upgrade of the social housing stock in the area and also aims to group housing upgrades together so that opportunities for retrofitting will arise for private housing with support from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  <\/p>  <p>  This Programme is being developed under a Retrofit Taskforce and as well as my Department, the preparatory work also involves the Department of Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment and the SEAI.  All involved are working with the relevant local authorities to advance retrofitting in areas of sufficient concentration of local authority housing requiring energy upgrades.<\/p>  <p>  Significant preparatory work has been completed to date, including a framework for the retrofit works and the identification by the local authorities of their selected areas of housing to be retrofitted. However, the cessation of many construction-related activities due to Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the work of the local authorities on this programme as essential preparatory work to survey local authority homes for the retrofit works was affected.  <\/p>  <p>  The adoption by the County and City Management Association (CCMA) of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for internal work to housing, has allowed the surveying work to proceed and as this is completed, it is expected that the retrofit works will commence on some local authority homes in August. The midlands pilot along with other pilot schemes which are due to commence rollout in early 2021, will be used to test key elements of the national plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD04100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Barracks","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[16439\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600056#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"when works commenced on the new gymnasium at James Stephen's Barracks, Kilkenny; and when works on same will finish.","asker":"1511","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that Kevin Moore (Building) Contractor Ltd were appointed, in October 2019, as the main contractor for the construction of a new gymnasium at James Stephen&rsquo;s Barracks in Kilkenny.

In such cases the principal of this school, following collaboration with the tutor, may be satisfied that there is sufficient credible evidence to allow him or her sign off on an estimated percentage mark.<\/p>  <p>  Despite every effort being made by schools and by the Department of Education, to provide calculated grades to as many students as possible, there will be a small number of cases where there is no credible evidence to support a calculated grade in a particular subject. To attempt to give a calculated grade in such cases would be unfair to all other candidates. <\/p>  <p>  Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so. <\/p>  <p>  No decisions have been issued by the Calculated Grades Executive Office in respect of any of students studying independently, to date.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has continued to engage with third level stakeholders regarding the Calculated Grades process for students seeking to progress to Higher Education.   This has resulted in an agreed common approach in relation to students who have not been able to obtain calculated grades in one or more subjects.  Students who have applied for a calculated grade, with a view to satisfying matriculation\/basic minimum entry requirements and for whom the Department has been unable to award a Calculated Grade in the subject(s), will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation\/basic minimum entry purposes.  The CGEO will notify the Central Applications Office (CAO) of any student who cannot be provided with calculated grades, and of the subjects involved, and the exemption from matriculation\/basic minimum entry will be granted automatically by the CAO.  The subject(s) for which exemption is granted will not attract points and the exemption cannot be used to satisfy additional prog<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600057#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600057#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[16434\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600057#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the planning application for a school (details supplied); when the planning application will be submitted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department's Design &amp;amp; Build programme and the project is currently at an advanced stage of Architectural Planning.

As a consequence of its flat rate structure a number of people, mainly low-hours workers, receive a higher State income support than they received in employment income. It is important that the integrity of the social welfare system is maintained and that income support paid is considered to be fair and equitable. In this regard it would not be tenable that some people, albeit a minority of people, receive a much higher payment on PUP than they did from part-time employment and that they would receive the same amount as another person who worked full-time on a higher income.  The changes introduced recently seek to address this issue in a balanced way.<\/p>  <p>  No person on the lower rate of payment will receive less on PUP than they were previously paid by their employer as a result of the changes.<\/p>  <p>  For self-employed persons &ndash; the last year for which complete data is available is 2018.  This is the year which was used for the purposes of reviewing the PUP rate.  Where no earnings data was available, in respect of either an employee or a self-employed person, the rate of PUP was reduced to &euro;203 per week. <\/p>  <p>  Where a customer contends that these earnings are inaccurate, they should supply documentation to support this.  However, it is important to note that this Department will only accept earnings which have been notified to Revenue and subject to PRSI.  Customers should clearly understand that any information which is supplied to declare additional earnings will be matched against Revenue records and that all cases of undisclosed or unreported income will be examined for follow up control action.<\/p>  <p>  According to the records of this Department the returns for the person concerned for 2018 reflect 52 S class contributions and a recorded income of &euro;9,718.

In accordance with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, and guided by the expert advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC), ELC and SAC services started to resume from 29 June. I am pleased that Government have committed a &euro;75m package of funding for reopening services over the summer months. A further package is being examined to cover the period from 24 August onwards. This substantial investment recognises the important role that the ELC and SAC sector plays in the societal and economic infrastructure of the country. <\/p>  <p>  The new &euro;75m funding package contains four significant elements: <\/p>  <p>-   A once-off Reopening Support Payment (RSP) for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. <\/p>  <p>  - A once-off COVID-19 capital grant for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. <\/p>  <p>  - Continued access for eligible providers to the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) <\/p>  <p>  - Resumption of DCYA ELC and SAC programmes. <\/p>  <p>  In developing the above funding package, the Department recognised that a reduced number of children were likely to attend ELC and SAC services in the initial weeks of reopening. This funding package was tailored to allow providers to operate with less parental income and to assist in meeting the costs associated with complying with public health requirements. The latter additional costs have been kept minimal as public health guidance has stated that previous adult child ratios in the childcare sector were appropriate to meet public health needs (one adult to 3,5,6,8,11 or 12 children maximum)  and the new Play-pod model merely allows two of those groups to come together ( or a variation of this) to help reduce the amount of relief cover necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The funding package also ensures that ELC and SAC providers will not charge higher fees than they did pre-COVID-19. This will benefit parents and children returning to services.<\/p>  <p>  A key policy priority for the Department is the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector and we continue to work intensively to support services to reopen and remain sustainable. The reopening funding package aims to support providers to reopen, staff to remain in the sector, parents to resume work, and children to benefit from quality ELC and SAC.<\/p>  <p>  The funding package described above was for the initial phase of reopening (from 29 June - 23 August). As stated earlier, my Department is now working intensively on a funding package to support the sector further for the 2020\/21 programme year - commencing 24 August. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is working closely with eight representatives groups of the sector through the Advisory Group on Reopening to develop an effective and efficient support package, which will be communicated to the sector as early as possible.  I met with 17 representatives of the sector on 15 July and was delighted to hear positive reports regarding the number of services that have already opened. Over 80%, so far, of services that normally open during the summer have already opened and more are expected to open next week and in early August.  Additionally, the high take up rate for grants for services planning to open in late August indicates that the vast majority of services that normally open in late August \/ early September will do so.  It is important to clarify that some reports in the media do not have a reliable evidence base.  <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the additional time required by ELC and SAC providers to complete the administrative work associated with the various DCYA-funded schemes, my Department provides a Programme Support Payment (PSP). The initial budget in 2017 for PSP was &euro;14.5m. This has since been increased and the total amount available to providers for the 2019\/2020 programme cycle is &euro;19.4m. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding PPE and physical distancing in ELC and SAC settings, expert guidance on the safe reopening of services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HPSC on 29 May. The guidance recommends, amongst other measures, the use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model to restrict interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children.Public health advice does not require any change to minimum adult-child ratios or to regulatory space requirements. While some settings may reduce capacity depending on their layout, there are no required capacity reductions, and most services should be able to comply with the public health advice with no or little reduction in capacity.<\/p>  <p>  HPSC advice is that additional PPE, over and above normal requirements for ELC and SAC services, is not required to be used by staff while they are caring for children. <\/p>  <p>  In line with  normal practice in these services, staff should wear disposable single-use plastic aprons, and non-powdered, non-permeable gloves when there is a risk of coming into contact with body fluids (such as when nappy changing). Supplies of these should be readily available in services.<\/p>  <p>  The HPSC has advised that services should keep a small supply of surgical masks in a readily accessible place for use by a staff member who develops symptoms of COVID-19 or by staff members caring for a sick child if they feel they need to use them.<\/p>  <p>  The Reopening Support Payment is available for services to not only meet the reopening guidelines, but to support children to remain in play pods and meet additional staffing needs during the reopening period. The Reopening Support Payment can be used to meet costs for hygiene supplies and consumables.<\/p>  <p>  More information can be found on the Department's website: Reopening Funding Package for Childcare Services FAQ.   <\/p>  <p>  State investment to the sector has increased by 141% over the last five budgets. The Government is committed to implementing First 5: A Whole-of- Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, which commits to at least doubling investment in Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare in the decade to 2028.    <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government reaffirms the importance of reforming the ELC and SAC sector and this is a priority for me over the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600059#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600059#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[16415\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600059#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to take into account both the immediate needs of the childcare sector and the long-term sustainability of the sector when drawing up the July 2020 stimulus programme; his plans for the long-term viability of the sector; the position regarding the ambitions of the plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>On 10 June 2020, my Department announced a major funding package to facilitate the reopening of early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services over the summer months.

Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth.  Any amendment to the legislation governing the provision of maternity leave, which falls under my responsibility, would require primary legislation.   As such an extension to maternity leave has not been proposed by Government, the total costs to the Exchequer, in particular if maternity benefit were also to be extended, have not been set out. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the particular challenges that mothers and parents have faced during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government is considering a proposal to advance the extension of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit to five weeks for all parents of children born after 1 November 2019, to enable every eligible parent of young children to spend additional time with their child.<\/p>  <p>  At present, Parent&rsquo;s Leave entitles each parent to 2 weeks&rsquo; leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, or in the case of adoption, within one year of the placement of the child with the family. <\/p>  <p>  The Government proposal would mean that eligible parents of children born during the pandemic crisis will get an extra three weeks of Parent&rsquo;s Leave to offset the impact of having a child during the strict lockdown measures. The period in which Parent&rsquo;s Leave can be taken will also be extended from one year to two years.  This, and related costs, will be considered as part of the Budget 2021 process.

I am advised that the Hamilton Review Group is currently finalising the draft report with a view to its publication in the coming weeks (Quarter 3 2020). <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that a significant number of bodies have key responsibilities to develop and implement anti-corruption policies, with the competence to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute corruption spread across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of other bodies with a mandate to tackle corruption.  <\/p>  <p>  These include, inter alia, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Standards in Public Office Commission, local authorities, the Ombudsman, Parliamentary Committees on Members' Interests, the Anti-Corruption Unit in the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee, other Oireachtas committees, regulators, Government Departments, the Director of Public Prosecutions and tribunals of enquiry and commissions of investigation.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has an extensive range of legislative provisions to prevent and combat corruption.

It strengthens and clarifies the law in relation to corruption. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also a party to a number of anti-corruption international instruments.  These are the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).

The regulations were signed by the then Minister for Health, following consultation with my predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, as well as the then Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of this, the Garda Commissioner and his senior team have implemented a carefully graduated policing response, based on its strong tradition of policing by consent.  Garda members engage, explain and encourage members of the public to comply and, only as a last resort, make use of their enforcement powers under these regulations.  In order to ensure that the policing of these public health restrictions is carried out in an appropriate, proportionate and human rights compliant manner, the Policing Authority have been requested to review the policing performance of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to provide reports to myself as Minister.

These include both arrests and incidents without arrest where name and address details were taken for consultation with the DPP on the decision to issue charges. Arrest remains a last resort. Of the 320 incidents, two were as a result of an instruction from a relevant medical professional as per the Act.<\/p>  <p>  As per Garda policy in relation to the regulations, in all cases where arrests were made under the regulations, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions on the decision to charge.<\/p>  <p>  Up to 27th June, in 110 of these incidents a charge or summons has issued. Most incidents involve a single individual but some have resulted in charges against multiple people. Up to the same date, in 29 of the 320 incidents the DPP directed no charge. The remainder continued to be under criminal investigation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, pre-existing enforcement powers were used in 2,177 incidents where other offences were disclosed in the course of Covid-19 operations. These range from incidents such as drink driving or disqualified drivers detected at checkpoints, to drugs and weapons seizures, to public order offences. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also conducted thousands of checks on licensed premises throughout the country under Operation Navigation to support public health guidelines since the operation began at 7pm on Friday July 3rd.<\/p>  <p>  In the period from July 3rd to July 12th inclusive, the vast majority of licensed premises operating have been found to be in compliance with regulations and licensing laws, but in 37 individual cases Garda&iacute; have found potential breaches of the health regulations or licensing laws even after providing the premises with the opportunity to rectify the situation.

This includes the use of various types of personal protective equipment including those that might be described as facemasks. These guidance documents are available on the HPSC website at www.hpsc.ie. <\/p><p>More generally, in respect of the use of face coverings by the public and in public places, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) provided guidance in relation to face coverings in its advice to Government in relation to Phase 2 of the Roadmap for Reopening Business &amp;amp; Society on 4 June.  As part of the continuing review of the evidence relating to face coverings, at its meeting on 15 July 2020, NPHET has updated its advice. <\/p><p>The NPHET advice sets out circumstances under which the wearing of a non-medical face covering is recommended.  These are when using busy public transport, when in indoor public areas including retail outlets, by people visiting the homes of those who are cocooning, by people who are being visited in their homes by those who are cocooning, all visitors to residential care facilities and in indoor work environments where it is difficult to maintain a two-metre distance.  The wearing of face coverings in other environments should accommodate individual judgement or preference or where it is difficult to maintain a 2-metre distance.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that the wearing of face coverings is an additional hygiene measure and should not take the place of good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and other personal protective public health measures.  Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and to wash hands before putting them on and taking them off.<\/p><p>On the 15th June, the Government and the National Transport Authority launched a national communications campaign  which outlines best practice for the use of face coverings in retail outlets, on public transport and in other public locations in which it is difficult to maintain social distancing or where this distance cannot be guaranteed, and are communicating to the public about:<\/p><p>- who should wear face coverings <\/p><p>- in what settings, and how to wear and remove face coverings correctly.<\/p><p>Guidance on how to make and safely use face coverings is available on gov.ie\/facecoverings and the HSE website. <\/p><p>On Friday 10th July the Minister for Health having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, signed the Health Act (Covid-19)(Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020. The regulations provide that, from 13 July 2020, members of the public shall not, without reasonable excuse, travel by public transport without wearing a face covering.<\/p><p>Reasonable excuse includes where a person:<\/p><p>- cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress <\/p><p>- needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating <\/p><p>- removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person <\/p><p>- removes the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury<\/p><p>- removes the face covering to take medication<\/p><p>The regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13 years. <\/p><p>Following further advice of NPHET, at its meeting of the 15 July 2020, the Government also agreed to the mandatory wearing of face coverings in retail outlets, shops and shopping centres. Retail staff will also be obliged to wear a face covering unless there is a partition between them and members of the public or where there is a distance of 2 metres between them and members of the public. Work on the development of relevant Regulations has commenced. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the public health advice relating to Covid-19, including that relating to face coverings, is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600059#WRG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[16335\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600059#WRG06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will include north County Dublin, Limerick city and so on in the daily Covid-19 dashboard in which new cases are arising; and if he will also include the gender of the daily new cases.","asker":"1569","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>Since the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) met for the first time, a commitment was given to collect and publish as much relevant data as possible while ensuring individual patient confidentiality is maintained at all times.

This report may add to that evidence and learning.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women.  Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, considerable work has been done to date and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants; and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues. As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  Any engagement process will need to take account of the wider context relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns were raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, including a number of Ministerial representations from the women affected or on their behalf.  At that time, the Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p>  <p>  This CMO Report was published in November 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the CMO report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery. <\/p>  <p>  Since July 2018, the HSE has paused all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This was at the request of the CMO and undertaken in advance of completion of the final CMO report. The pause was instigated pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of initial recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  <\/p>  <p>  The CMO report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional procedures.  However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p>  <p>  The CMO report made a number of recommendations, the implementation of which will provide significant assurance that both women presenting for treatment and who develop mesh-related complications, receive high quality, multi-disciplinary patient centred care in accordance with the evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) is progressing treatment pathways and referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications. <\/p>  <p>  A multidisciplinary National Specialist Centre is being developed over 2 sites at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.  In addition, two translabial scanners, were procured by the HSE in late 2019, and are now onsite in both hospitals.  However, the first scanning clinic, which was due to take place last March had to be postponed, due to the pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. <\/p>  <p>  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[16386\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the further length of time a person (details supplied) can be expected to wait for an appointment in University Hospital Limerick.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020.

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.

These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required medical report and a completed application form from a healthcare professional.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009 the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school. <\/p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys.  On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:<\/p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;<\/p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to cancer screening CervicalCheck made the technical transition to HPV cervical screening on 30 March.  This means that any test taken after this date is an HPV cervical screening test with follow-up cytology if required. <\/p>  <p>  The move to HPV Cervical Screening means that Ireland joins a small group of nations that employs the best-in-class testing to screen their populations for cervical cancer.  Other countries include Australia, England, the Netherlands and Wales.<\/p>  <p>  This improved testing methodology, along with the continued roll-out of HPV vaccinations, means that Ireland can look forward to a significant reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer cases over the next 10-20 years.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s goal is to bring about the eradication of HPV-related cancers in Ireland.  A well organised screening programme, when combined with HPV vaccination for boys and girls, will help assist us in achieving that goal.  The Programme for Government commits to supporting the CervicalCheck Screening Programme and promoting the uptake of the HPV vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH05600"},{"type":"question","counter":496,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[16438\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number on the orthodontic waiting lists in Dublin across each category of need; the number of patients treated from each category in the most recent year for which data is available; and the position regarding the scope of speeding up access to care.","asker":"1549","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":497,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Data","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH05900"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[16440\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071600060#WRH06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cataract operations that were carried out at St. Luke's hospital, Kilkenny, in 2019 and to date in 2020.","asker":"1511","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for Government.
