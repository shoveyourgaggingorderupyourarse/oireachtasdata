The scheme also pays an annual premium to the landowner of up to &euro;680 per hectare payable each year for 15 years.<\/p>  <p>  Measures included in the programme are voluntary and comprise the main Afforestation Scheme (incorporating Native Woodland Establishment, Agro-Forestry and Forestry for Fibre), as well as a variety of support schemes to help forest owners with the management of their forests, including timber mobilisation. <\/p>  <p>  This approach has resulted in over 28,000 hectares of forestry having been planted on private lands during the Programme so far.<\/p>  <p>  The money will also help to progress the programme of reform and delivery of a new forest strategy which is happening under Project Woodland. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be\u00a0aware, Project Woodland was launched in February this year and one of its key objectives is the creation of a shared national vision for forestry and the development of a new Forest Strategy for the future of forests in Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This includes an extensive and inclusive public consultation, which has been approved by the Project Board and will be undertaken as a matter of priority.

BEAM was funded by a combination of &euro;50 million EU aid and over\u00a0&euro;27 million Exchequer support. It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall as a result of disturbance to the market. <\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the scheme,\u00a0under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU, was that there had to be an element of re-structuring built into the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared with the period 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Reviewing the requirement at this stage is not an option. The money was paid to the participants who committed themselves to the explicit condition that they would make the 5% reduction.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Any change would be a\u00a0 breach\u00a0 of the EU regulation under which the &euro;50 million was granted to Ireland.\u00a0 It would\u00a0 also be grossly unfair to the almost 19,000 participants who have already met their commitments under the scheme\u00a0 and to those farmers who were eligible but opted not to join the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 21,000 beef finishers were eligible for a payment under the scheme but chose not to participate in the scheme, having reviewed the commitments required, which included\u00a0the 5% reduction. Their average payment would have been over &euro;1,300 each. <\/p>  <p>  Following engagement with the\u00a0EU Commission, I secured flexibility around the deadline for meeting the 5% reduction. I\u00a0introduced\u00a0an\u00a0option in March 2021\u00a0to\u00a0 allow participants choose an alternative reduction period of 1st January 2021 - 31st December 2021. This was to give\u00a0 participants every chance of meeting their requirements under the scheme.. The option to select this facility remained open until 21st June 2021 with more than 16,000 applying. <\/p>  <p>  When the original reduction period ended on 30th June 2021, it was identified that\u00a0approximately 5,300 of those\u00a0approximately 16,000\u00a0BEAM participants who had\u00a0opted to defer had in fact met all their BEAM commitments including the\u00a05% bovine\u00a0nitrates reduction. The Department therefore removed\u00a0them from the later reduction period.<\/p>  <p>  This leaves approximately 10,700 BEAM participants in the later reduction period. These participants will continue to receive a monthly letter from my Department (as all participants have done since February 2021) outlining the amount of nitrates they have already used (accumulated), the amount of nitrates they have left if they are to\u00a0 meet their 5% reduction and a projection based on the livestock numbers on their\u00a0holding of their final nitrates position at the end of the reduction period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100079#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100079#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[51714\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100079#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the Beef Taskforce; if he has received the report from the Beef Taskforce; when the report will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>The Beef Taskforce was established on foot of the beef sector agreement of 15th September 2019.\u00a0 The Beef Taskforce's remit as set out in its terms of reference was to monitor the implementation of the actions arising from that agreement.

It also provides funding to promote and assist the development of specific support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system, which of course includes victims of domestic and sexual crime.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment of this Government to combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and to supporting victims is reflected in the funding allocated under Budget 2022, with a total of &euro;13m allocated to my Department for this. This represents an increased allocation of &euro;5.35m and will enable us to roll out specific awareness raising and training programmes to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence. It will also allow us to provide additional supports to NGOs and specific domestic violence intervention programmes and it will support a number of front line activities. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this, an additional\u00a0&euro;1.1m will be used to put in place a legal advice and legal aid service in court for victims of sexual violence and &euro;1 million is being provided to the Garda vote to refurbish and upgrade the Divisional Protective Service Units. This will allow us to better support and protect vulnerable victims. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department is leading the development across government of the third national strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence. This plan will outline how the government will radically improve services and supports for victims and will be the most ambitious plan to date. My Department is also currently implementing Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, our plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, and which was published by Minister McEntee last year. It will reform the criminal justice system at every point a victim comes into contact with it, while a national public awareness campaign on consent will further strengthen work to prevent these crimes. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding secured under Budget 2022 will allow us to continue to build on the work undertaken this year. We will continue to improve the system for victims, to better support them and through various means to raise awareness of, and to combat, all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. <\/p>  <p>  As part of our work to combat\u00a0sexual harassment, domestic and sexual violence we are running awareness raising campaigns to bring about a change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with a view to decreasing and preventing this type of behaviour and violence. <\/p>  <p>  The final instalment of a three-year awareness campaign on sexual violence, entitled &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo; is currently being aired across radio, tv and various other social channels. Work is also underway to develop a national campaign around the meaning and importance of consent in sexual relationships. It is also expected that as part of the Third National Strategy&rsquo;s focus on prevention and informing victims of supports available, there will be new and potentially multi-faceted campaigns required.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On the legislative side, a new law enacted earlier this year has\u00a0introduced preliminary hearings for the first time. This will ensure greater protections for vulnerable victims and witnesses in sexual offences cases. <\/p>  <p>  'Coco's Law', also referred to as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act, entered into force on 10 February 2021. Among other provisions, it broadened the offence of harassment and increased the\u00a0penalties for the more serious forms of harassment. It also\u00a0created new offences of sending, or threatening to send, intimate images without the consent of the person whose image it is. <\/p>  <p>  The Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill has completed drafting and it is\u00a0intended this Bill will be brought\u00a0to my Government colleagues for approval to publish in the coming weeks.

Having considered the possible inequities and administrative challenges of such an exemption or waiver structure the group recommended instead a deferral scheme that would assist property owners in a number of different scenarios including low income.  The interdepartmental group recommended that where taxpayers are entitled to, and have elected for, deferral of LPT, interest due on deferred payments should be at a lower rate to the rate charged on overdue LPT which is 8% per annum. The Government accepted these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) accordingly includes arrangements whereby a person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax if certain conditions are met. Any LPT that is deferred between 2013 and 2021 carries an interest charge of 4% per annum.  Interest will accrue on the deferred amount until such time that it is paid off. In providing for the possibility of deferral of the tax, the reduced rate of interest recognises that the circumstances in which a person defers the tax charge are very different from those where the property owner simply fails to pay the tax. <\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Interdepartmental LPT Review Group recommended that the income thresholds for LPT deferrals should be reviewed regularly by reference to (i) movements in the CPI, (ii) wage growth in the economy, and (iii) changes in fixed income payments by the State. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 provides that from the next valuation date of 1 November 2021, the deferral thresholds will increase to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple. This is an increase of 20% in these thresholds. <\/p>  <p>  A review of the interest rate on deferred LPT also took place this year, in advance of the next LPT valuation period (i.e. 2022 to 2025).  The review took account of the Covid initiative on the warehousing of tax debts, in respect of which a reduced interest rate of 3% applies for late payment of outstanding liabilities.  In the interests of consistency and fairness, the Government decided to reduce the LPT deferral rate to 3%.  The 3% rate will apply to any LPT that is deferred on or after 1 January 2022.  It will also apply to any LPT that was deferred between 2013 and 2021, to the extent that it is still outstanding in 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for or does not wish to avail of a deferral there are a wide number of phased payment options available to assist with budgeting. The various options are designed to provide the maximum possible flexibility for individual circumstances. Throughout the pandemic, Revenue has engaged extensively with individual taxpayers experiencing difficulties paying taxes due to the pandemic to agree flexible arrangements that best suit their circumstances, including in respect of LPT liabilities and will continue to fully engage with taxpayers facing tax payment difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01200"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[51757\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an updated analysis on the forecasted losses or gains to the Exchequer arising from Ireland&rsquo;s decision to sign up to Pillars One and Two of the OECD global corporation tax reform initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>You are aware that, on Friday 8th October, Ireland joined 135 other member jurisdictions of the OECD\/G20 Inclusive Framework in reaching a high level agreement on a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitisation of the economy in recent years.  <\/p>  <p>  There are two pillars to the OECD agreement. Pillar One will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer. This means that, in effect, corporate tax revenue streams which now flow to the Irish Exchequer will flow to the Exchequers of other countries when implemented.  Pillar Two will see the adoption of a new global minimum effective tax rate of 15% applying to multinational companies (MNEs) with global revenues in excess of &euro;750m. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners has estimated that the cost of the agreement could be up to &euro;2 billion annually when both pillars come into effect. This  figure is included in the Stability Programme Update, the Summer Economic Statement (SES), and in the medium term forecast included in Budget 2022. This is an extremely challenging exercise, both in terms of timing and magnitude. For the purpose of calibrating this medium-term forecast, the impact of international tax reform is very tentatively estimated &ndash; in terms of revenue foregone &ndash; at &euro;2 billion relative to baseline by 2025; the revenue impact is phased in from 2023.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect to the exercise to estimate the cost of the agreement, it is important to note that there have been significant changes in recent months to the original proposals, both in relation to Pillar One, in which there is now a higher re-allocation than was originally foreseen, and on Pillar Two through the adoption of a 15% minimum rate as well as the introduction of substance based carve-outs based on the carrying value of assets and payroll. The substance based carve-out is expected to offer relief to taxpayers from the minimum effective rate but this is difficult to estimate as it will be firm specific. Indeed, predicting how individual companies may react to a potential new tax regime is very difficult.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be stressed that while there is now a broad high level agreement in place on the main features of a solution, discussions are continuing and will continue into 2022 on how the agreement will be implemented in practice. For instance, the discussions on Pillar One will need to examine the rules in respect to reallocation from entities within a group. Further, it remains to be seen what additional tax will be paid by MNEs under Pillar Two when substance based carve-out rules are applied which can reduce the effective tax rate paid by an MNE. In terms of further complexity, the final agreement on these carve-outs include a 10 year transition period where the carve-out percentage is reduced year-on-year. <\/p>  <p>  A further consideration is that although there are two pillars to this Agreement, it is important to understand that they are intended as integral parts of a single agreed solution. How they interact and the degree to which this interaction influences business behaviour is very difficult to predict.<\/p>  <p>  For all these reasons, I do not believe that I yet have sufficient grounds to revise the working estimate of a potential annual cost of up to &euro;2 billion that I have used in assessing the potential impact of the agreement on the public finances.<\/p>  <p>  As technical discussions on the implementation framework continue, officials from my Department and from Revenue will keep the position under review and, when and if necessary, my Department will provide an update on how the agreement is expected to impact the public finances. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Consultations","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01500"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[51758\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when his Department will publish the submissions made to the recent public consultation process on corporation tax reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the responses to the Department of Finance's public consultation on the OECD tax reform proposals was published on my Department's website on Thursday 14 October 2021. <\/p><p>The submissions are available at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/5e8d3-responses-to-oecd-tax-reform-consultation\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01800"},{"type":"question","counter":476,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[51778\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 130 of 12 October 2021, if he will clarify a series of matters in relation to bank branches (details supplied).","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":477,"content":"<p>Officials from my Department contacted the Central Bank of Ireland regarding the Deputy's question and received the following response: <\/p><p>&quot;The Central Bank cannot comment on its engagements with individual regulated entities, due to supervisory confidentiality obligations.<\/p><p>The Central Bank expects Banks to take a consumer-focused approach in respect of any decision that affects their customers.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, this Government recognises the concerns felt by many businesses, including in recreational and leisure areas, such as the mobile sauna business, regarding the cost and availability of insurance. It has therefore prioritised the implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. As the Deputy may be aware, the first Action Plan Implementation Report, which was published in July, shows that significant progress has been made, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), published last week, shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development; it is my hope that this trend will continue and result in lower costs for businesses.  As the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers. Minister of State Fleming, in his ongoing engagement with the sector, has emphasised the need for insurance providers to reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to provide cover in new areas.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.

Under customs law, VAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods; usually this will be the purchase price, plus the cost of transport and insurance, plus any customs duties payable.<\/p>  <p>  The VAT treatment of agents depends on their legal status.  In general, where an agent is the de facto importer of the goods, then the agent is responsible for the payment of the VAT on imports.  In such a case, the agent may qualify to use the Postponed Accounting arrangements which were introduced under last year&rsquo;s Brexit Act.  These new rules allow an accountable person to self-account for VAT on imports on their normal VAT3 Return.  The benefit of this is that instead of having to pay VAT up-front at the time of importation, the accountable person may wait until they are making their VAT3 return and, subject to the usual rules on VAT deductibility, they can reclaim VAT at the same time as it is declared.  The Postponed Accounting arrangements are intended to alleviate cash flow issues where VAT-registered businesses might otherwise have to pay import VAT at the point of importation of goods and then wait until their next VAT return is filed before they could recover the VAT.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that different procedures are in place for agents who are not the importer of the goods.  I would recommend that the taxpayer uses the MyEnquiries facility within the Revenue Online Service (ROS) to confirm the appropriate tax treatment that applies to their particular circumstances.

In line with this mandate, the Central Bank introduced macroprudential measures for residential mortgage lending in February 2015. The objective of these mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households and to reduce the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by relevant financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. The LTI limit is 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income. For first-time buyers, the LTV limit is 90% of the value of the residential property, (i.e. a deposit of 10%). <\/p>  <p>  While regulated lenders must comply with the various rules within the macro prudential and consumer protection frameworks, the extension of credit by lenders to potential customers is a commercial decision for the lender themselves and each lender will have its own individual credit lending policies. <\/p>  <p>  Before providing a mortgage, lenders are required to undertake thorough creditworthiness assessments to ensure a borrower will be able to repay the mortgage. This assessment must take into account the individual circumstances of the borrower, including personal circumstances and financial situation.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that in general, lenders do take rental payments into account when making their affordability assessment as part of regular underwriting process, to assess borrowers&rsquo; ability to repay a mortgage.  However, there is no Central Bank guidance or guidelines to lenders specifically in relation to their consideration of rent being paid by mortgage applicants in the context of their mortgage applications. This is for each bank to determine and to set out in its credit policy and it is therefore not an issue that I can instruct the Central Bank or lenders on.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that a mortgage is the largest liability that most households will take on in their lifetime. It comes with less flexibility than a rental contract, leaving borrowers more exposed to shocks to incomes, house prices and interest rates in the future.  The ability to make regular repayments &ndash; evidenced through rental payments &ndash; does not substitute for the protection for borrowers in having a deposit. A mortgage deposit acts as a cushion of housing equity, and can help households to absorb house price falls without the borrower falling into negative equity.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Central Bank is carrying out a review of the framework for the mortgage measures throughout 2021 and 2022, in parallel to its regular annual reviews of the calibration of the measures to ensure they continue to remain fit for purpose.  The Central Bank has advised that this review will provide it an opportunity to examine a range of topics including but not limited to the objectives of the mortgage measures, the choice of tools and the framework and strategy used for calibration.  The evolution of the housing and mortgage markets since 2015 and that the availability of new data sources (such as the central credit register) will inform the Bank's analysis. Given the widespread international use of mortgage measures, the Central Bank has also advised that it will also analyse how different countries implement and evaluate their macro prudential measures to ensure it takes international learning and best practice into its review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100086#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100087#WRM00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100087#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[51783\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100087#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the events by community groups, both local and national, that have been granted use of Kilmainham Gaol by the OPW for the past five years.","asker":"1485","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>The attached File gives details of events by community groups, both local and national that have been granted use of Kilmainham Gaol by the\u00a0Commissioners of Public Works\u00a0over the past five years, after engaging with the site's permission process, providing proof of Insurance and other necessary documentation in order to receive approval to proceed.<\/p>  <p>www.data.oireachtas.ie\/ie\/oireachtas\/debates\/questions\/supportingDocumentation\/2021-10-21_pq184-21-10-21_en.pdf<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100087#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[51869\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100087#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if it is normal practice for the Office of Public Works to provide premises or building space, rent free to private not-for-profit organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility on behalf of the State for managing and maintaining a substantial and complex estate - comprising approximately 2,500 properties -&ndash; valued at over &euro;3bn.<\/p>  <p>  This extensive and diverse portfolio of State properties includes office accommodation for all Government Departments, the property estate for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and numerous properties for many State Agencies.

It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

The advisors from the ASSAP will discuss any agricultural measures with the farmers. With the assistance of the farmer, the ASSAP advisor will seek to identify the main source of pollution to the catchment and agree the draft actions to be acted upon.

The criteria included only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process.

In August 2020, I expanded the remit of the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality to cover all areas of equality, diversity and inclusion. As part of this extended remit, the HEA has been working with stakeholders to advance work in the area of race equality. In order to build a strong evidence base for future policy and funding decisions, the Higher Education Authority conducted this national survey of staff in higher education to develop a picture of race equality across the Irish higher education sector.<\/p><p>This report is extremely important as it gives us, for the first time, data in relation to the experience of staff from minority ethnic groups in Irish higher education. It highlights that higher education institutions have an opportunity to play a critical role in relation to racial inequalities in wider society. There is an opportunity for higher education to become a beacon of good practice in this area. This report is the first of its kind in this area and will help HEIs to keep pace with wider demographic changes in Irish society. Through the implementation of the recommendations of this report, the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion will continue to advance race equality in higher education in collaboration with HEIs, their representative bodies and other key stakeholders. <\/p><p>A central recommendation of this report is the systematic collection of data which will provide the necessary evidence base regarding staff and student representation, access and outcome by ethnicity. From December 2020, as part of the HEA&rsquo;s ongoing work in the area of staff equality, diversity and inclusion, HEIs have been requested to return staff ethnicity data to the HEA. This is in addition to the collection of data on HEI staff by gender. To foreground this request, the Athena SWAN Ireland Intersectionality Working Group was established in 2019 by the National Committee for Athena SWAN in Ireland in conjunction with the HEA, with an initial goal to develop a cross-sectoral approach to collecting data on staff and student ethnicity in the Irish higher education sector. The group is open to staff members from HEIs with academic or professional expertise in this area as well as representatives from the HEA. This current focus on ethnicity data and race equality was specifically called for by HE stakeholders (particularly in relation to Athena SWAN requirements).<\/p><p>In May 2020, the Intersectionality Working Group produced a statement (<i>hea.ie\/assets\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Intersectionality-WG-Statement-on-Ethnicity-Categories-in-Irish-HE.pdf <\/i>) to provide staff in HEIs with information on the rationale for collecting ethnicity data and the complexities of categorisation. The statement also provides some context for race equality work in higher education, as well as recommended actions for HEIs to consider. The statement has been endorsed by 25 HEIs, as well as by the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association. In their statement the working group recommended that &ldquo;the Irish higher education sector moves to create an evidence base regarding staff and student representation, access and outcome by ethnicity with the explicit purpose of recognising and tackling institutionalised racism and advancing equality in higher education.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The findings of this survey highlighted potential variances in earnings across different ethnic groups. The next step is to ensure we have a comprehensive data set in relation to the ethnicity of HE staff. Due to the historical absence of such data, the HEA is working proactively with HEIs to ensure that such data is collected and provided to the HEA on an annual basis in order to monitor progress in this area. The proposed HEA legislation will allow for better collection of staff data across all equality grounds, including information on the ethnic breakdown of staff across our institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100094#WRT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100095#WRU00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":732,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100095#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":733,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[48264\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100095#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider prioritising applications by Afghans currently in direct provision centres given the difficult and increasingly stressful situation in Afghanistan; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":734,"content":"<p>For those who are in the international protection process, our objective is to have decisions made on their applications, including the permission to remain consideration, as soon as possible.

The referendum was passed and section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 gave effect to this constitutional amendment which permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 and\u00a0the Criminal Justice Act 2017\u00a0amended\u00a0the Bail Act 1997 to make further provision in respect of the criteria to be considered in refusing bail. The 2017 Act strengthened the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Court is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the granting of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.\u00a0 It is also open to judges to refuse bail for a serious offence where that is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.<\/p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the 2017 Act\u00a0provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews and strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail.\u00a0 If an individual fails to comply with any of the bail conditions, the judge will issue a bench warrant. This gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to arrest and bring the person before the court to answer all charges relating to the bail. \u00a0In the event of a breach of High Court bail, an application is made to the High Court for a warrant and once arrested the defendant must be brought before the High Court as soon as practicable for a revocation hearing. A breach of bail may also result in an additional charge. The judge may also make an order and\/or surety for &lsquo;forfeiture and estreatment&rsquo; of the bail money.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I am advised by Garda authorities that the amended bail laws have proven to be effective and have assisted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the threat of organised crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100096#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":786,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100096#WRV02400"},{"type":"question","counter":787,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[51945\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102100096#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which garda&iacute; injured in the course of their duty have their cases followed up to their satisfaction; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":788,"content":"<p>I have sought the information\u00a0requested by the Deputy from the Garda authorities.

is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, including the recruitment and training of Garda members and staff. Under Section 33 of the Act, the Commissioner shall determine the distribution and deployment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State. As Minister, I play no role in these independent functions.  <\/p><p>Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 (as amended) provides the statutory basis for the Garda Youth Diversion Programme. The intention of the programme is to divert children and young people who have engaged in criminal or anti-social behaviour away from the criminal justice system and towards more positive life choices. Children who commit criminal offences are considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme, as provided in the Children Act 2001. Each such case is assessed and the Director of the Garda Diversion Programme, who is generally a Garda Superintendent, decides if the case is suitable or not for inclusion.<\/p><p>The operation of the programme includes informal and formal Garda warnings, delivered in the presence of parents or guardians, as well as provision for supervision by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that as of 30 September, the latest date for when figures are available, the following table shows the number of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers by Division and rank.  <table>    <tr>       <th><br \/><br \/>Division<\/th>       <th><br \/><br \/>Sergeant<\/th>       <th><br \/><br \/>Garda<\/th>       <th><br \/><br \/>Total<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><br \/><br \/>Cavan\/Monaghan<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>2<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><br \/><br \/>Clare<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>1<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><br \/><br \/>Cork City<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>1<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>6<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><br \/><br \/>Cork North<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>3<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><br \/><br \/>Cork West<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>2<\/td>       <td><br \/><br \/>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><br \/><br \/>D.M.R.

Without access to a patient&rsquo;s full history and previous diagnostic investigations, it was not considered safe to proceed without all electronic support systems in place. This impacted patients with complex needs in particular, and restricted the patient cohort that could safely proceed with surgery during this time.<\/p>  <p>  Most systems are now back up and running across CHI sites, but back-loading of information is ongoing, and this continues to have an impact on waiting lists and the number of surgeries completed.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the impact of the pandemic and the cyberattack Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland advise that as of the end of September 2021, 266 spinal surgeries had been carried out which is an increase of 41 compared to the same period last year. <\/p>  <p>  CHI remain committed to increasing activity levels and examining innovative methods to improve access to all specialities. For example, additional theatre sessions are being held in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic patients. <\/p>  <p>  CHI also continues to develop the Advanced Clinical Triage clinic model in City West. Active Clinical Triage is a system which has been adapted for use within the paediatric orthopaedic unit at CHI Crumlin and its purpose is to reduce the overall orthopaedics out-patient waiting list, starting with the longest waiting clinically appropriate referrals.<\/p>  <p>  A new Orthopaedic Consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions started in Temple Street in September which should also enable the use of additional theatre capacity and support additional capacity as part of the Cappagh Kids programme. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with CHI regarding scoliosis services. CHI have advised that all patients with a diagnosis of scoliosis require a pre-operative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multiple diagnostic investigations and review by a multi-disciplinary team. The plan of care which is implemented for each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements. It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.
