Justice Plan 2022 contains several actions under the objective to divert young people away from crime and anti-social behaviour. A specific priority is the action to publish new criminal legislation by the end of Quarter 4 that will deal with adults who groom children into criminal activity. <\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0should\u00a0be noted that this is a complex area as in many cases the adult in question is known to the child and may in some cases even be a family member, causing potential issues with regard to witness testimony.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel to legislative action, my Department will continue to roll out the community intervention programme, 'Greentown', which seeks to break the link between children who are engaged or at risk of engaging with a criminal gang.

Significantly, the strategy commits to broadening the Youth Diversion Programme (YDP) service so that every child or young person who would benefit from this service may do so, primarily through the expansion of the geographical coverage of the existing network of 105 YDPs, but also through the establishment of a small number of new projects where a need is identified.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, YDPs operate as a vital support to the statutory Garda Diversion Programme in cooperation with local Garda&iacute;.

Two subgroups have been established under the forum to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are a range of fora in place in the Cork division for anti-social behaviour to be identified and responded to.<\/p>  <p>  For instance, under the Community Policing Framework, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in regular contact with community representatives, councillors, resident associations and members of the public. This allows for the sharing and gathering of information around issues of anti-social behaviour.\u00a0In turn, Community Policing Units target these areas in an effort to alleviate the issue. The Garda Analysis Service also assist in identifying areas of concern.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the public can also highlight anti-social behaviour through Community\u00a0Safety Forums which are held at least three times a year throughout Cork city. I am informed that any location highlighted as a concern for anti-social behaviour is noted at such meetings and added to a tasking sheet within the relevant Community Engagement Area and station for the implementation of increased patrols.<\/p>  <p>  Liaison with external stakeholders is conducted on a near constant basis by Garda Community Engagement teams, including with Cork City Partnership, Hollyhill Youth Project, Cork City Council, as well as local sporting clubs. Community Policing members also liaise with Muintir Na T&iacute;re and this is designed around safety for the elderly, particularly those living in areas of where anti-social behaviour is reported.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Policing Committee is an additional forum where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages with external agencies to identify problem hotspots across the city. This will ultimately be expanded into a Local Community Safety Partnership when the Policing, Security and a Community Safety Bill is enacted.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Department's community safety policy is published on the Gov.ie website and will be delivered through new Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs), currently being piloted in three locations: Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Longford and Waterford. The pilots will run for two years and a robust evaluation is ongoing during this process in order to ensure the proposed structures are fulfilling their objectives, this process will inform the national rollout of the LCSPs across local authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department opened applications on 11 April for the new Community Safety Innovation Fund, which will see the proceeds of crime re-invested in local projects to improve community safety. The fund will have an initial outlay of &euro;2m for this year and will be subject to a robust evaluation at the end of Year 1 to inform future decisions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the kind of projects which may be supported will include new activities, not\u00a0 already covered by existing funding streams, including projects to:<\/p>  <p>  - tackle crime or reduce the fear of crime;<\/p>  <p>  - support the creation of safe and resilient communities; and<\/p>  <p>  - divert vulnerable individuals away from engagement in criminal behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The fund is open to bodies involved in community safety and will support them in addressing local needs and opportunities for innovation not provided for in other funds managed by Departments and agencies. The call for applications for the fund runs until 8 June 2022 and grants will range from &euro;20,000 to &euro;150,000.<\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of any suitable projects in Cork, I would urge you to encourage them to apply for funding. Completed application forms are to be returned by 5pm on 8 June 2022 to a dedicated email address: CommunitySafetyInnovationFund@justice.ie<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 also provides a comprehensive developmental framework to support children and young people subject to multiple disadvantage and guide them away from involvement in anti-social or criminal behaviours. Critically, the strategy commits to broadening the Youth Diversion Project (YDP) service so that every child or young person who could benefit from this service may do so, primarily through the expansion of the geographical coverage of the existing network of 105 Youth Diversion Projects, but also through the establishment of a small number of new projects where a need is identified. The YDP service will continue to play a vital role in combatting anti-social behaviour and supporting communities.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, one of the two pilots of the Youth Joint Agency Response to Crime (Y-JARC) is currently taking place in Cork, operated out of the Mayfield and Gurranabraher Garda Districts. This pilot seeks relevant State agencies\u00a0to engage with the\u00a0young people identified as causing most harm in their locality in a joined-up manner, in order to provide the necessary support to assist them in ceasing their offending behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400064#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400064#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[25984\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400064#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider introducing mandatory minimum sentences for those persons who assault frontline workers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputy will join me in condemning any assaults made on our frontline workers.\u00a0I would encourage anyone with knowledge of such offences to report this information to their local\/nearest Garda station. It is imperative that frontline workers are protected in carrying out their work and that the law reflects and responds to the situations in which they find themselves.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities for such offences. Any assault causing harm on any person is an offence under section 3 of the Non&ndash;Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. A person convicted of such an offence would be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to a maximum fine of &euro;2,500, or to both, or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides for the offence of assault or threatening to assault certain categories of persons.\u00a0Such persons include a person providing medical services in a hospital, or any person assisting such a person, a peace officer or any person assisting a peace officer, or any other person with intent to resist lawful apprehension or detention for an offence.\u00a0 The term 'peace officer' includes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a prison officer, a member of the fire brigade, ambulance personnel or a member of the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  A person convicted of an offence under section 19 of the 1994 Act would be liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of &euro;5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both. A person convicted of such an offence on indictment would be liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years, or to both. The latter penalty was increased from a maximum term of 5 years in 2006.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, sentencing in individual cases is a matter solely within the discretion of the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances of the case and of the accused and subject to any limits as may be prescribed by law for a particular offence.\u00a0The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender; in that process, identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie, and then applying any mitigating factors.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.<\/p>  <p>  On mandatory sentences, I am mindful that there are differing views and I will continue to keep the law in this area under review.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2021, my Department commenced a review of enactments providing for the imposition of minimum mandatory sentences in accordance with section 29 of the Judicial Council Act 2019. A report is to be provided to the Oireachtas on foot of this review by December of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences are unconstitutional post the\u00a02019 Ellis\u00a0judgment of the Supreme Court. On foot of this judgement, it was necessary to repeal all such offences in 2021 via the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2021. These offences related primarily to certain firearms and misuse of drugs offences.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Judicial Council Act 2019 provides for a range of matters, including provisions relating to developing schemes for judicial education and training provisions and provisions on sentencing guidelines, which are intended to assist with more consistency in sentencing.

The reforms introduced will help to make sure they are not victimised further by the processes they need to go through in order to seek the justice they deserve. Some of these actions include:<\/p><p>- The introduction of preliminary trial hearings which will reduce delays and increase efficiency in how our criminal trials are run and will remove some of the uncertainties victims face about potential issues arising after a trial has started. While Preliminary Hearings will not change the fact that a trial is an adversarial process, their introduction should make trials more predictable and help them run more smoothly;\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- The nationwide rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs);<\/p><p>- The first cohort of staff at a new sexual offences unit in the Director of Public Prosecutions office formally took up their roles in April;<\/p><p>- Work to advance the training for all personnel who come into contact with vulnerable victims is underway;<\/p><p>- An academic consultant from the University of Limerick\u00a0has been tasked with developing the framework for the operation and training of intermediaries. I announced the launch of the new qualification programme at the University of Limerick earlier this month. Once training of these intermediaries has taken place, a pilot will take place in two locations; one in Dublin and one in a rural area.<\/p><p>In addition to the above, a review of the supports and funding of civil society organisations providing frontline services has been conducted to identify where gaps may exist and how to bridge them. Specific geographical areas and categories of victims that are not adequately covered by NGO supports were identified and last November my Department engaged with relevant NGO partners to agree revised funding to ensure that we met the gaps identified.<\/p><p>As regards the progression of the sexual offences legislation recommended in the O&rsquo;Malley Report, work has started on drafting the heads of a General Scheme of a Sexual Offences Bill, which is expected to go to Government later this year. The Bill will make provision for:<\/p><p>- Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims<\/p><p>- Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public<\/p><p>- Legal representation for victims in certain cases.<\/p><p>Other initiatives being progressed, which are intended to assist victims to be aware of their rights and know where to go to get support, include:\u00a0<\/p><p>- The publication of an updated Victims Charter and a supporting website which sets out all the information a victim of crime might need in an easily accessible and user friendly way;<\/p><p>- A campaign to raise awareness of the rights afforded to people under the Victims of Crime Act 2017;<\/p><p>- The establishment of the Victims&rsquo; Forum for state, social and community groups to discuss how best we can work together to meet the needs of victims.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition to our work to reform the criminal justice system so that it better supports victims, I recently announced funding for 2022 totaling &euro;4.6m for more than 60 organisations that provide support to victims of crime.

The role of the GNDOCB is to proactively, via intelligence-led investigations, target top tier Organised Crime Groups impacting on this jurisdiction.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This is achieved through effective collaboration with all sections of Organised and Serious Crime, and other sections within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through partnerships with other law enforcement agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service, and partnerships developed with international law enforcement agencies globally.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m and &pound;142,520 (UK) was forfeited to the State in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  On 2\u00a0July 2021,\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara,\u00a0which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that recent successes of Operation Tara include the seizure of drugs valued at in excess of &euro;388,000 following a search operation in Finglas on 20 April 2022 and a further drugs seizure in Portlaoise with an approximate street value of &euro;90,000 on 12 May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD01250","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Victim Support Services","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[25980\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider the recommendations made in a report (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the O&rsquo;Malley Review of Protections for Vulnerable Witnesses in the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences arose out of concern about low reporting levels for rape and other sexual assaults and about how victims are treated within the reporting, investigation and trial processes. <\/p><p>The focus on the victim and on reforming the criminal justice process to make the experience as safe and secure for the victim as possible is reflected in each one of the 52 recommendations in the report. \u00a0<\/p><p>In October 2020, I published and commenced implementation of\u00a0&lsquo;Supporting a Victim's Journey&rsquo;, which is a detailed action plan for implementing the reforms that are necessary to ensure a victim-centred approach to the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. <\/p><p>I am committed to fully implementing &lsquo;Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo; which will address to some extent the matters raised in the report referred to by the Deputy.\u00a0I would also emphasise that 'Supporting a Victim's Journey' is a living document, and any new action will be considered as required.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware that, as part of the reforms I am introducing, the victim will be entitled to their own dedicated legal advice and support throughout the process (not just during the court case) and the availability of legal aid will be extended for this purpose. This will cover legal advice for victims for the duration of the trial, someone whose only role in the case is to advise them. <\/p><p>Provision will be made for the victim to have the same legal representation during Preliminary Trial Hearings and the trial itself if a victim is to be questioned about past sexual history.<\/p><p>I have also set up a number of sub-groups to work on advancing some of the high priority recommendations.<\/p><p>The first of these were tasked with mapping the journey that faces the victim and reviewing the availability of supports and the funding of civil society organisations providing frontline services. This subgroup commissioned an expert consultant to analyse and categorise the supports provided with grant funding made available by my Department.<\/p><p>The consultant identified a) geographical areas and b) categories of victims which represent gaps or unmet needs in the current provision of these support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system. The consultant completed this exercise in July of last year and my Department contacted identified NGOs to distribute extra funding to provide additional services to address the gaps identified.<\/p><p>Recently I announced funding totalling &euro;4.6m for more than 60 organisations to support victims of crime. This is an increase of over 20% on the previous total fund of &euro;3.8m which was made available in 2021.<\/p><p>The second subgroup is carrying out work on the training of Intermediaries and the establishment of a pilot programme. An academic consultant from the University of Limerick, with the support of the sub-group, has been tasked with developing the framework for the operation and training of intermediaries and will engage with stakeholders in the development of such. I announced the launch of the new qualification programme at the University of Limerick earlier this month. Once training of these intermediaries has taken place, a pilot will take place in two locations; one in Dublin and one in a rural area.<\/p><p>Another subgroup is focused on developing specialist training (legal and otherwise) for the full range of frontline staff and professionals who engage with vulnerable victims, including legal professionals. My Department has engaged a consultant to conduct a mapping exercise to establish what training is already being provided, and in what areas.\u00a0 This exercise has commenced and has a relatively short timeframe for completion so that the next phase of the development work can begin. <\/p><p>Outside of the work of the sub-groups, a number of key actions have been delivered as part of implementing Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey including:<\/p><p>- The introduction of preliminary trial hearings which will reduce delays and increase efficiency in how our criminal trials are run and will remove some of the uncertainties victims face about potential issues arising after a trial has started. While Preliminary Hearings will not change the fact that a trial is an adversarial process, their introduction should make trials more predictable and help them run more smoothly;\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- The nationwide rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs);<\/p><p>- The first cohort of staff at a new sexual offences unit in the Director of Public Prosecutions office formally took up their roles last year;<\/p><p>- The establishment of a Victims&rsquo; Forum to provide further opportunities to engage closely with frontline organisations who support victims; and<\/p><p>- Work to promote the rights that victims of crime have and the supports that are available to them is advancing, including through the development of a new Victims Charter website\u00a0and the distribution of informative printed material to public locations around the country.<\/p><p>In relation to the updates on sexual offences legislation that have been recommended in the O&rsquo;Malley Report, I have prioritised the drafting of the heads of a General Scheme of a Sexual Offences Bill. Justice Plan 2022 commits to publishing the Sexual Offences Bill later this year. The publication of the journal article referred to by the Deputy, &ldquo;Towards a Presumption of Victimhood: Possibilities for Re-Balancing the Criminal Process&rdquo;, written by Mr. Justice Peter Charleton and Orlaith Cross in the Irish Judicial Studies Journal, is a very important contribution to the literature in this area. I can assure the Deputy that the analysis contained in the article and the recommendations made will be fully considered in the context of drawing up the Sexual Offences Bill, which as I have said is a priority. <\/p><p>I am confident that the reforms being implemented as part of\u00a0Supporting a Victims Journey\u00a0will create a supportive criminal justice system where every victim of a sexual offence feels that they can come forward confident in the knowledge that they will be supported throughout the entire process, treated fairly and have their dignity respected at all stages. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":164,"content":"<p>Question No. 66 answered with Question No. 41.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[26071\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the action that she is taking to tackle repeat offending; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>As part of our work to ensure a coherent approach to enhancing and sustaining a more just and safe society, the Government committed to\u00a0reviewing policy options for prison and penal reform. I intend to publish a Penal Policy Action Plan shortly which will set out the actions we will take according to timelines that will be published. Among the issues which will be looked at in the plan are the appropriate use of non-custodial sanctions and the role they can play in addressing criminality, reducing reoffending and providing protection to the public while holding the individual accountable.<\/p>  <p>  Non-custodial penalties, particularly supervised community sanctions, play a significant and important role in addressing criminality, reducing reoffending and providing a degree of protection to the public. This is supported by Central Statistics Office figures on recidivism.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill 2014 seeks to update the Probation of Offenders Act 1907. The aim of the Bill is to provide a modern statement of the law governing community sanctions, and the role of the Probation Service.\u00a0It will facilitate the effective and efficient use of community sanctions by the courts, and will ensure that the courts have a wide range of appropriate options for dealing with persons who have committed minor offences.<\/p>  <p>  Justice Plan for 2022 commits that the policy review of the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill 2014 will be completed in Q2 of this year.

It aims to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management to maximise the potential engagement of prisoners in constructive and structured activities during their time in custody.<\/p>  <p>  The prisons Work and Training service make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody. Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning and industrial skills.<\/p>  <p>  The \"Working to Change Social Enterprise and Employment Strategy 2021-2023\" sets out my Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by simultaneously working to remove systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes.

The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Service.\u00a0 The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.<\/p>  <p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, curriculum development that is specific to prison circumstances have taken place, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts, in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We also know that substance abuse is an indicator of an increased likelihood of recidivism.<\/p>  <p>  To look at how we address this, last April, together with the Minister for Health and Ministers of State Frank Feighan and Mary Butler, I established a High Level Taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of persons interacting with the criminal justice system.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for a cross-Government approach to meeting the complex needs of such people, the Taskforce comprises representatives from a wide cross section of health agencies, the Justice sector and other relevant stakeholders.

the restricting of a person&rsquo;s liberty is a serious issue, given the Constitutional presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.<\/p><p>While the State&rsquo;s bail laws do provide for the refusal of bail in certain circumstances, the presiding judge is entirely independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the decision to grant bail in a particular case is solely a matter for the judge.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Bail Act 1997 was introduced following a referendum in 1996 which amended the Constitution to enable a court to refuse bail for a person charged with a serious offence to obviate the risk of another serious offence being committed while on bail.<\/p><p>Over the last 25\u00a0 years the State&rsquo;s bail laws were further strengthened, specifically by the Criminal Justice Act, 2007, the Criminal Justice Act, 2015, and the Criminal Justice Act, 2017.\u00a0<\/p><p>In considering whether to refuse bail under the 1997 Act, the Court is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant and, in specific circumstances, the nature and likelihood of any danger to a person or to the community from granting bail.<\/p><p>The 2017 Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews and strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail. If an individual fails to comply with any bail conditions, the judge will issue a bench warrant and this gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to arrest and bring the person before the court to answer all charges relating to the bail.<\/p><p>In the event of a breach of High Court bail, the defendant must be brought before the Court as soon as practicable for a revocation hearing. A breach of bail may also result in an additional charge and an order and\/or surety for &lsquo;forfeiture and estreatment&rsquo; of the bail money.<\/p><p>While I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the State's amended bail laws have proven to be effective, I can advise the Deputy that all legislative provisions are kept under review. However, there are no immediate plans to introduce further bail legislation at this time.<\/p><p>In tandem with the development of the Third National Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Strategy, I am currently progressing a number of proposals to enhance the existing legislation we have to combat all forms of DSGBV.<\/p><p>I recently announced my intention to publish a Bill which will include new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation. While both are already crimes, I&rsquo;m proposing a number of changes to make the law in this area clearer and stronger, and to encourage victims to come forward.\u00a0<\/p><p>I will soon publish a new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender. This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.<\/p><p>Before the end of September, I will publish a new Sexual Offences Bill which will introduce important changes including:<\/p><p>- Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims<\/p><p>- Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public<\/p><p>- Legal representation for victims in certain circumstances<\/p><p>Separately, I will seek to enact the Sex Offenders Bill later this year which will strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community.<\/p><p>I also recently signed an order to bring into operation the Criminal Procedure Act 2021. This Act provides for the use of preliminary trial hearings which will significantly improve the trial process for victims of sexual offences, including by reducing delay and disruption that might re-traumatise victims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[22637\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400066#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the criteria used by an immigration officer to determine if a non-European Economic Area national is granted leave to land and thus to gain entry to the State upon presentation at Dublin Airport; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>The Border Management Unit (BMU) of my Department has responsibility for frontline immigration duties at Dublin Airport.<\/p><p>Under Section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004, an Immigration Officer must determine whether a non-EEA national should be granted entry to the State. <\/p><p>An Immigration Officer will have regard to the following matters in making a decision on whether to grant entry to the state in accordance with Section 4(10) of the Immigration Act 2004:<\/p><p>- the stated purpose of the proposed visit to the State;<\/p><p>- the intended duration of the stay in the State;<\/p><p>- any family relationships (whether of blood or through marriage) of him or her with persons in the State;<\/p><p>- his or her income, earning capacity and other financial resources;<\/p><p>- the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which he or she has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future; and<\/p><p>- whether he or she is likely to comply with any proposed conditions as to duration of stay and engagement in employment, business or profession in the State.\u00a0<\/p><p>The onus is on the individual to have all documentation relating to their reasons for entering the State ready for presentation to the immigration officer to gain entry.<\/p><p>If a person indicates or is identified as being in need of international protection, they are admitted to the international protection process.

These measures generally stem from ICAO&rsquo;s &lsquo;basket of measures&rsquo; which has four pillars comprising market-based measures, sustainable aviation fuels, aircraft technology, and operational efficiencies. <\/p>  <p>  CO2 emissions from aviation have been included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) since 2012.  This requires aircraft operators within the European Economic Area (EEA) to monitor, report and verify their emissions, and to surrender allowances against those emissions. As the number of allowances is capped, airlines are required to either reduce emissions or purchase emissions credits. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Fit for 55 legislative package, officials from EU Member States, including Ireland, are currently discussing the Revision of the ETS for Aviation at the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Environmental Working Party. This proposes phasing out the free allowances granted to airlines by 2027 and will integrate, as appropriate, the ETS and the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The EU ETS for Aviation has already contributed to reducing the sector&rsquo;s carbon footprint by more than 17million tonnes per annum and the tightening of the system will further incentivise aircraft operators to reduce their emissions or face increasing costs under the &lsquo;polluter pays&rsquo; principle.<\/p>  <p>  CORSIA will require aircraft operators to offset CO2 emissions from international civil aviation which are above 2019 levels. All EU Member States, including Ireland, have volunteered to participate in CORSIA from the Pilot Phase onwards (2021 &ndash; 2026). The countries that have volunteered so far cover just under 80% of all international aviation.  Under the current proposal, the ETS will continue to apply to intra-EU flights and CORSIA will apply to flights between the EU and third countries participating in CORSIA. Between the ETS and CORSIA, the vast majority of commercial flights to and from Ireland over the coming years will have their emissions accounted for by way of ETS allowances or through ICAO approved offsets.  <\/p>  <p>  Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are renewable or waste-derived aviation fuels that have the potential to substantially reduce overall CO2 lifecycle emissions by up to 80% when compared to fossil fuels. These fuels can be used as a drop-in fuel within the existing global fleet and fuel supply infrastructure. SAF can be produced from chemical processes using various feedstocks, both biological (e.g. Agricultural\/forestry residues or Used Cooking Oil) and Synthetic (e.g. Green Hydrogen). <\/p>  <p>  Along with their European colleagues in the Aviation Working Party, officials from my Department have been working on the introduction of the RefuelEU Aviation initiative, a directly applicable Regulation that proposes the introduction of SAF mandates on fuel suppliers.  This would be on an increasing scale from 2% in 2025 to 63% in 2050.  This also includes a synthetic or e-fuel sub-mandate starting at 0.7% in 2030 and rising to 28% in 2050. At national level, work is also ongoing on ascertaining Ireland&rsquo;s biofuel needs and resources and potential for Green Hydrogen generation.  <\/p>  <p>  Although Ireland does not have an indigenous aerospace sector and is generally a &lsquo;technology taker&rsquo;, Irish airlines have invested heavily in newer fuel-efficient aircraft over recent years.  New engine technologies, lightweight seats, and improved winglets all significantly improve the environmental performance of aircraft compared to earlier models. Highly efficient new aircraft have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of fuel burn. Data also shows that Irish airlines operate with relatively high passenger load factors meaning carbon emissions, on a per passenger basis, measure favourably when compared with other airlines in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Aviation emissions can also be reduced through operational improvements such as enhanced air traffic management. The Single European Sky (SES) is an initiative that aims to de-fragment European Air Traffic Management by centralising and harmonising operations across the EU. While not part of the Fit for 55 package, the current proposed reform has the potential to achieve a 10% reduction in European aviation emissions and officials from the Department of Transport continue to lobby for its reform in Brussels.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Air Navigation Services Provider, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is engaged in various operational initiatives to improve air traffic flows en-route, cross-border and in the vicinity of airports.  Several of these measures such as Continuous Decent Approaches (CDA) and Reduced Departure Intervals (RDI) lead to increased fuel efficiency and reduced emissions from aircraft. <\/p>  <p>  Dublin, Shannon, and Cork airports are participants in the Airport Council International&rsquo;s Carbon Accreditation Programme.  This carbon management certification programme independently assesses the efforts of airports to manage and reduce their carbon footprint and provides a framework for continual improvement through varying levels of certification. Dublin Airport has been formally designated as carbon neutral Level 3+ under the programme, while Cork and Shannon have been designated Level 2 and Level 1 respectively. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the monitoring of ambient air (the air breathed at ground level) is primarily the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400069#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400069#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[25844\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400069#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the budget allocated to the public charge point scheme in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":344,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[25845\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400069#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the budget allocated for electric vehicle grants in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[26548\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400069#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the total Government budget allocation for the construction of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in 2022; the total funding committed by the ESB for developing charging infrastructure in 2022; the total number of charge points broken down by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 132 and 154 together.<\/p><p>Providing a sustainable, low-carbon transport system is a key priority of my Department.

This is a commercial matter for individual companies to assess on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with their own calculation of various factors, including risk. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from any such intervention. <\/p>  <p>  However, this Government acknowledges the strong concerns felt by many groups, including the childcare sector, regarding the cost and availability of insurance. While recognising that there is no single legislative or policy fix to the issues faced by some businesses, this Government has nonetheless moved to address them through the implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. This sets out 66 actions to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduces the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government published the Second Action Plan Implementation Report in March 2022, which showed that 80 per cent\u00a0of the actions were being delivered. Our focus has now shifted towards delivering the remaining aspects of the Action Plan, most notably rebalancing the duty of care. Proposals for this important reform were approved by Cabinet in recent days. <\/p>  <p>  My officials have also been working with the IDA to leverage the achievements of the reform agenda with overseas insurers, in order to help persuade them to enter the insurance market. The IDA has commenced a targeted and multi-phased engagement process with several underwriters with work actively underway on this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  I believe this Government has taken the right approach in addressing the issue of insurance in Ireland, and I am pleased to report that a leading international insurer has expanded its risk portfolio into the childcare\/activity sector in recent weeks. This is a welcome development, and may prompt other firms to do the same. It is also proof that the insurance industry is responding positively to the Action Plan and the practical progress it is making. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.\u00a0 In this regard, it is my intention to work with my colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all sectors in the economy, including the childcare sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400070#WRH05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Investigations","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400070#WRH05700"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[26337\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400070#WRH05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of investigations, internal or external, commissioned by his Department into instances in which Departmental documents or information was leaked to the media, which were commissioned or conducted in each of the past ten years and to date in 2022; the nature of such leaks and investigations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>My Department has not commissioned any investigations into instances in which Departmental documents or information was leaked to the media during the timeframe specified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400070#WRH05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[25884\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of OPW controlled sites and visitor attractions have been handed over to local authorities in the context of management and maintenance in the past ten years to date; the number of sites and attractions that the OPW have devolved responsibility to private companies and or persons over that same time period.

In this way, officials from my Department engage with their counterparts on proposals in relation to a variety of expenditure measures including in relation to social welfare, housing, and childcare. However, queries in relation to specific policy are in the first instance for the relevant Minister who has policy responsibility in that area. <\/p><p>From an overall expenditure perspective I would highlight the level of expenditure provided by the Government to support public services and individuals is &euro;87 billion in 2022. This expenditure includes additional provision to support individuals and the economy to address the challenges of Covid as we emerge from the pandemic. <\/p><p>Regarding Social Protection supports, investment in the sector for 2022 is expected to reach &euro;23.3 billion, including amounts allocated for Covid supports.<\/p><p>Looking at the impact of Social Protection expenditure, I have been advised by the Department of Social Protection of the following in relation to the impact of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Scheme Covid-19  supports, and social transfers more generally, on the At Risk of Poverty Rate. These Covid -19 supports had a significant impact on the At Risk of Poverty rate. The At Risk of Poverty rate for 2021 was 11.6%. This would have been 19.9% without these Covid-19 supports. <\/p><p>These Covid-19 supports also had a positive impact on the median household disposable income in SILC 2021. The median household disposable income in 2021 of &euro;46,471 increased by 5.8%, but would have decreased by 6.2% without the Covid-19 income supports.<\/p><p>Including social transfers show the wider impact of the system on the At Risk of Poverty Rate. Social transfers include income from Department of Social Protection (DSP) sources such as jobseekers related payments, state pension, family and children related allowances, as well as other state supports such as education related allowances and housing allowances. <table>    <tr>       <th>At Risk of Poverty Rate %<\/th>       <th>2021* <\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Before Social Transfers<\/td>       <td>38.6% <\/td>       <td>36.5% <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>After Social Transfers<\/td>       <td>11.6% <\/td>       <td>13.2%<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The 2021 SILC data show that social transfers performed well in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate, from 38.6% before social transfers to 11.6% after social transfers. This equated to a poverty reduction effect of 70% in 2021. <\/p><p>In comparison, the 2020 SILC data show that social transfers performed well in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate, from 36.5% before social transfers to 13.2% after social transfers. This equated to a poverty reduction effect of 63.8% in 2020.<\/p><p>* Up until 2019 the CSO used the ESSPROS definition of 'social transfers'.  This means that occupational pensions, redundancy and retirement lump sums and social transfers from other countries were classified as social transfers. From 2020 we have moved to a national definition of social transfers, which includes transfers from Department of Social Protection (DSP) sources such as unemployment related benefits, state pension, family or children related allowances, etc., as well as education related allowances and housing related supports, but not occupational pensions or redundancy or retirement lump sums from employers.<\/p><p>Regarding housing investment the Housing Programme has more than tripled since 2016, from just under &euro;1 billion to over &euro;3.6 billion in 2022. The Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to tackle the housing crisis is evidenced in the funding allocated to the Department of Housing in the revised National Development Plan. This is an unprecedented level of funding for housing provision.  In 2022 the Department of Housing will receive a record c. &euro;6 billion in Exchequer funding. <\/p><p>Housing for All commits to investing unprecedented amounts of funding to expand the State&rsquo;s role and achieve the Government&rsquo;s objective of delivering sustainable, good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price. The Plan targets the delivery of over 300,000 new homes by 2030. Including over 90,000 social homes and 54,000 affordable homes. This is the most ambitious social and affordable housing build programme in the history of the State. <\/p><p>In relation to childcare the Government recognises that there are significant challenges facing the childcare sector including the costs of childcare for parents. In response to this the Government has continued to increase the level of investment in the sector. Since 2015, the levels of State support and investment in Early Learning Care and School Aged Care has increased by 166%, rising from &euro;270 million in 2015 to &euro;719 million in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[25933\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if an OPW inspector will contact a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In circumstances where a dissolved company is restored to the Register, the Companies Act 2014 provides that such a company shall be &ldquo;deemed to have continued in existence as if it had not been struck off&rdquo;.  In such circumstances, the company may assert that the property of the dissolved company is no longer vested in the State under Section 28 of the 1954 Act and for this reason the Minister is limited in dealing with the property while restoration is an available remedy.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the limited knowledge which the Minister has in respect of this property, it is suggested that  enquiries be made with the former directors and secretary of Whitony Limited (dissolved).  It may also be possible that the property in folio DN30239F has been taken in charge by Dublin City Council, given it contains the roads and common areas in the estates.  If the property in the folio has been taken in charge, this would not be apparent from the folio.  <\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the State Property Act 1954 ensure that property is never ownerless but this does not mean that the State enters into occupation of these properties.  The State is not in occupation of this property.  Accordingly, the Minister is not liable for any loss, damage or injuries that may occur. <\/p>  <p>  My officials will contact the owner of the residential property and seek more details of the issues encountered on her property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Government Communications","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[26116\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the Ministerial contact details for persons (details supplied).

The OPW, as a matter of course, consults with the Land Development Agency, Local Authorities, the Health Service Executive, the Department of Education and other State bodies in advance of any decision on the future of a property.  <\/p><p>In 2021, the OPW also engaged with the Department of Rural and Community Development to discuss the use of the former Garda stations.  The OPW provided the Department of Rural and Community Development with a list of former Garda stations which closed as part of the 2012 and 2013 Policing Plans. This was provided in order for that Department to evaluate the properties for community use and\/or regional hubs.  The OPW has not been made aware by the Department that any of the properties are required for regional hubs.  In addition, a list of vacant properties and sites has been provided to the Departments managing the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine.  <\/p><p>Once it has been established that surplus properties are not suitable for alternative State use, the OPW then considers if open market disposal is a viable option.  Prior to disposing of a property, the OPW may re-evaluate the property&rsquo;s potential and decide whether there may be a benefit to retaining a strategic property or site for future use or development.  In this specific context, the OPW must take a long-term view on the potential future utility of such properties rather than seeking short-term commercial gain.  <\/p><p>Finally, the OPW may consider community involvement, subject to a detailed submission that demonstrates that the community or voluntary group seeking to use the property has the means to insure, maintain and manage it in order to reduce costs to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>The table below lists those properties that are being planned for disposal during 2022\/2023, unless alternative State use is identified in advance of disposal. <\/p><p>In relation to properties being prepared for disposal on the open market, auctioneers are appointed by the OPW following a procurement process.

","asker":"1497","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181, 182 and 185 together.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2022, the Minister published the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 which will, inter alia, dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and establish a new regulator, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, which will be responsible for overseeing updated regulations for broadcasting and video on-demand services and the new regulatory framework for online safety created by the Bill. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill will also transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive into Irish law. Article 13(2) of that Directive gives Member States the option to levy media service providers under their jurisdiction or which are not under their jurisdiction, but that are targeting audiences in their territories, to fund the production of European works. Following a Regulatory Impact Assessment provision was made for a content production levy within the General Scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Section 53 of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 provides for the imposition of a content production levy (termed the &lsquo;European works levy&rsquo;) on media service providers (i.e. providers of broadcasting and video on demand services) to fund a scheme (termed &lsquo;the European works scheme&rsquo;) to support the production of European works, including Irish works. The Bill provides that both the levy and the associated scheme would be administered by Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that any levy system will have to abide by the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination under EU law. Accordingly, any levy will be imposed equally on all on audiovisual media services targeting the Irish market, both Irish based and those based outside Ireland. This means that Irish media service providers such as RT&Eacute; and Virgin Media Television will also be subject to this levy. In addition, both Irish and services established elsewhere in the European Union would be eligible to apply to the content production fund established as a result of the levy. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it should be noted that any levy will only apply to income earned within the State. For example, if a provider such as Netflix earns 2% of their overall EU revenues in the State, the levy can only apply to that 2% of their overall revenues.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the aforementioned factors, it is not envisaged that the content production levy would be put into effect until Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n has carried out independent research into the viability of such a levy in an Irish context. One of the initial priorities of An Coimisi&uacute;n will be to carry out this research and to present recommendations to the Minister in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Given the importance of An Coimisi&uacute;n, Government has approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. While An Coimisi&uacute;n will, as set out in the Bill, ultimately be funded through levies on regulated services I secured &euro;5.5 million in Budget 2022 to provide start-up funds to resource the establishment process. <\/p>  <p>  The immediate priority in this context will be the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise to establish and lead An Coimisi&uacute;n and to lay the groundwork for the commencement of its functions as set out in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  It will be necessary to have such key staff in place to oversee research into the levy and make recommendations to the Minister in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":494,"content":"<p>Question No. 182 answered with Question No. 181.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ05000"},{"type":"question","counter":496,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[25706\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400071#WRJ05100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the dates of the meetings of the Audiovisual Action Plan steering group in each of the years 2020, 2021 and for the first five months of 2022; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The text of these Regulations is available online at:<\/p><p>Affordable Purchase homes are being delivered by Cork City Council in Boherboy, Cork City in the near future using Departmental Serviced Sites Funding.\u00a0 This includes 22 two- and three-bed dwellings to be delivered at a purchase price of &euro;218,000 to &euro;243,000. A further 15 units are be completed by year end, and will be sold according to the associated regulations, meaning they will be sold at a price related to applicants&rsquo; means, subject to a minimum set sales price. Under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, the difference between the market price and the sales price will be held as a percentage equity stake held by the local authority until redeemed. <\/p><p>Cork City Council have also indicated that they will deliver 36 Affordable Purchase homes in Cluain Chaoin, Tower in two phases this year, with indicated prices of &euro;237,000 for a 2-bed, &euro;275,000 for a 3-bed, &euro;300,000 for a 4-bed Affordable Purchase home.<\/p><p>In addition to the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, the First Home shared equity scheme will be available nationally on a demand-led basis and it will help applicants to afford new homes in the private market through the use of an equity share model. First Home will only support purchases of homes within regional price ceilings, set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by first-time buyers in the area.

The Passport Service also receives a small number of paper-based applications through our network of embassies and consulates across the world. All paper-based applications are processed through the centralised automated passport service system, regardless of the channel through which they are made.<\/p><p>The Passport Service has received 60,000 paper-based applications since 1<sup>st<\/sup>January 2022. Of these, 43,000 are Passport Express applications made by persons residing in the State.<\/p><p>There are currently 35,000 paper-based applications in the Passport Service system. Of these, 29,000 are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. A further 6,500 applications are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting on the applicant to submit required supporting documents. \u00a0<\/p><p>The target turnaround time for Passport Express applications is 8 weeks. When an applicant is requested to submit additional supporting documents, these documents are prioritised upon receipt by the Passport Service, and the Passport Service then aims to process the application within 15 working days. <\/p><p>The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens worldwide who wish to apply for a passport. These include a postal application system, online passport application service, in person counter application facilities at the passport offices in Dublin, Cork and London, and the network of Irish Missions worldwide.<\/p><p>Some 90% of all passport applications, including first-time applications, are now being made online. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including a mail-in, paper-based service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use online passport services. Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service can be accessed by all first-time applicants, including children and adults, in over 50 countries worldwide. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. Passport Online offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to four times faster than the paper-based passport renewal application system.<\/p><p>While there is a very high volume of applications in the Passport Service system, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is proactively managing the current demand for passports and has put in place resources and structures to address the estimated significant increase in demand for passports in 2022 in this essential citizen service.<\/p><p>The Passport Service has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand since June of last year. A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway over the past several months. This has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by 344 since June 2021.<\/p><p>In addition, the Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs). The interviews have concluded and TCOs recruited from this competition are being assigned on a weekly basis from Monday, 23 May. The first group of 20 new TCOs started work on Monday, 23 May. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the Passport Service to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the Passport Service in June of last year.<\/p><p>Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p><p>The Passport Service continues to implement further measures to deal with increased demand on its services:<\/p><p>-The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022<\/p><p>-The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.<\/p><p>-The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.<\/p><p>-A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.<\/p><p>-Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.<\/p><p>-There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.<\/p><p>-The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.<\/p><p>Since March of this year, the Passport Service\u00a0has reduced the processing time for first-time applications from 40 working days to 30. This\u00a025%\u00a0reduction\u00a0in processing times is a direct result of the substantial level of investment my Department has made in the service.\u00a0<\/p><p>I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022 and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400076#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":791,"content":"<p>Question No. 276 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":792,"content":"<p>Question No. 277 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":793,"content":"<p>Question No. 278 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":794,"content":"<p>Question No. 279 answered with Question No. 244.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":795,"content":"<p>Question No. 280 answered with Question No. 244.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":796,"content":"<p>Question No. 281 answered with Question No. 244.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":797,"content":"<p>Question No. 282 answered with Question No. 244.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":799,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[25871\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400076#WRO01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of staff working in the Passport Office each month since January 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":800,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[25872\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400076#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if there are plans to increase resources in the Passport Office ahead of the summer holiday season; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":801,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[26012\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400076#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department will recruit more staff to deal with the influx of passport applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[26302\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400076#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of whole-time equivalent staff currently employed in the Passport Office by role in tabular form.","asker":"1453","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283, 284, 294 and 315 together.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is proactively managing the current demand for passports and has put in place resources and structures to address the estimated significant increase in demand for passports in 2022 in this essential citizen service.<\/p><p>The Passport Service has been scaling up  resources to deal with anticipated demand since June of last year.

Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.<\/p><p>- A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.<\/p><p>- Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.<\/p><p>- There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.<\/p><p>Since March of this year, the Passport Service\u00a0has reduced the processing time for first-time applications from 40 working days to 30. This\u00a025%\u00a0reduction\u00a0in processing times is a direct result of the substantial level of investment my Department has made in the service.<\/p><p>I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to further reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022 and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p><p>The number of staff working in the Passport Office each month since January 2021 is outlined below in tabular form.<\/p><p><b>Passport Service staff numbers by month<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Staff Numbers by Month<\/th>       <th>2021<\/th>       <th>2022<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>January<\/td>       <td>477<\/td>       <td>726<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>February<\/td>       <td>470<\/td>       <td>730<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>March<\/td>       <td>468<\/td>       <td>726<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>April<\/td>       <td>466<\/td>       <td>705<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>May<\/td>       <td>465<\/td>       <td>725<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>June<\/td>       <td>463<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>July<\/td>       <td>463<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>August<\/td>       <td>482<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>September<\/td>       <td>502<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>October<\/td>       <td>519<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>November<\/td>       <td>569<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>December<\/td>       <td>617<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The number of Passport staff by role are outlined below in tabular form.

A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway over the past several months.

The interviews have concluded and TCOs recruited from this competition are being assigned on a weekly basis from Monday, 23 May. The first group of 20 new TCOs started work on Monday, 23 May.

The new EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) entered into force on 1 March 2021. It aims to intensify EU-Armenia co-operation in numerous sectors including the economy, business and trade, education. With the support of the EU, Armenia has agreed to undertake reforms in areas such as rule of law, democracy, good governance, judicial independence, anti-corruption, human rights, and the economy. The fourth EU-Armenia Partnership Council was held in Brussels on 18 May 2022.<\/p><p>The European Commission also has competence to act on behalf of Member States in relation to trade and investment treaties, including Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). Consequently, Member States have not concluded BITs with third countries since the adoption of the Treaty. <\/p><p>Armenia is set to benefit considerably under the EU&rsquo;s Economic and Investment Plan for Armenia. Announced in July 2021, &euro;1.6bn is available in grants, soft loans and guarantees for five flagship initiatives, with up to &euro;1bn potentially available in private sector financing. Armenia is also a member of the EU's Eastern Partnership mechanism.<\/p><p>The Irish Ambassador to Bulgaria, H.E. Martina Feeney, is accredited to Armenia on a non-resident basis and presented her credentials to President Sarkissian in October 2021. H.E.

Such unilateral action in respect of an internationally binding agreement is damaging to trust and will serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the Protocol is being implemented.<\/p>  <p>  At a time when people in Northern Ireland have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the Executive back up and running, the path chosen by the British government is of great concern. It undermines political stability and confidence in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy. This unilateral action is contrary to the wishes of people and business in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has indicated that it is ready and willing to resume talks with the UK at any time on implementing the Protocol. I urged the Foreign Secretary to engage constructively and in a spirit of partnership with the EU to resolve the issues that matter most to people and businesses in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I engage widely and regularly with political, business and civic society contacts in Northern Ireland. I have listened carefully to the genuine concerns of people and business in Northern Ireland around the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and having a greater say on how the Protocol works. There is a basis for solutions to all of these issues in the package of Proposals brought forward by the Commission last year. I fully agree with Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic&rsquo;s view that there is further potential to be explored in these proposals.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to undertake regular and extensive outreach with my counterparts across the European Union on this and other matters, as does Minister of State Thomas Byrne. It is clear that the EU remains united in its commitment to Northern Ireland. With the full support of the Member States, Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic and his team have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions.<\/p>  <p>  I note also that the Taoiseach remains in regular contact with both Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking to her on this matter on May 19, the President of the European Commission Charles Michel, with whom he spoke on May 16, and with Prime Minister Johnson with whom he spoke on May 10. We continue to urge the UK to engage in intensified EU-UK discussions to address issues relating to the implementation of the Protocol.

Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.<\/p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme builds on significant investment by the Department of Education in energy efficiency through the 2009\/10 Cavity and Attic Insulation\/Water Conservation Scheme and ongoing Summer Works and refurbishment projects.<\/p>  <p>  The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 51% emissions reduction.

The latter stage of the National Development Plan will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Schools can also avail of funding in respect of their accommodation under the Annual Minor Works Grant or the Summer Works Scheme.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account, for example, classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At primary level, the annual staffing schedule determines the allocation of teachers to schools.\u00a0The current allocation is on an average ratio of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.\u00a0 Budget 2022 has implemented a further 1 point reduction for the 2022\/23 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022.\u00a0 Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This Budget measure has brought the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the lowest ever seen at primary level.\u00a0 This is the second successive Budget which has seen an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an\u00a0improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 16:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015\/16 school year to the 2020\/21 school year.\u00a0\u00a0This compares favourably with the OECD pupil teacher ratio which is 1:15. In the same period the staffing schedule\u00a0improved from 28:1 to 25:1 for this school year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 23.3 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes for this school year, and statistics on this will be published later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400080#WRS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Facilities","counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400080#WRS02300"},{"type":"question","counter":950,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[25787\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400080#WRS02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an application has been received by his Department from a school (details supplied) to get funding in order to upgrade to three phase ESB connection; when a decision can be expected regarding same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Overall, this intensive intervention has seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, already opened nationwide for the 2021\/22 school-year. <\/p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide.

This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 provides funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs (in 2022)\u00a0to provide support to children with special educational needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs to 19,169 at the end of December 2022.<\/p><p>Provision for 19,169 SNAs as at 31<sup>st<\/sup>December 2022 will represent an increase of 81% since 2011 at which time 10,575 were provided.<\/p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.<\/p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs. \u00a0Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p><p>When a school has been allocated an SNA, the Board of Management, as the employer, is responsible for filling the vacancy and the decision on whether to employ a full time SNA to fill a full time post or to employ an equivalent number of part time SNAs, rests with the employer.<\/p><p>My Department acts as paymaster to over 3,700 schools who&rsquo;s Boards of Management are the direct employers of the SNAs in those schools. SNAs in the Education and Training Board sector are employed and paid by the ETBs. Information of the number of people employed to fill the posts allocated is not available. However, the NCSE publish statistics on SNA allocations to primary, post primary and special schools in tabular form, by county and by school, for each school year, this information is available on their website, <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>or by using the following link: <i>ncse.ie\/statistics<\/i>.<\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.\u00a0 SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.\u00a0Information of the number of pupils receiving the support of an SNA in mainstream schools is therefore, not available.<\/p><p>The SNA allocation to a special school can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enroll in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time. There is a prescribed special class to SNA ratio. ASD special classes have an allocation of 1 teacher and 2 SNA posts to cater for the educational and care needs of 6 students. Additional SNA support above the prescribed ratio may also be sanctioned by the NCSE where there are individual children who have significant care needs which require support above the level of support already sanctioned to the school.<\/p><p>As this question relates to the statistics on the allocation of SNA support, I have referred the question to the NCSE for its direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400081#WRT06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1053,"content":"<p>Question No. 386 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1054,"content":"<p>Question No. 387 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1055,"content":"<p>Question No. 388 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1056,"content":"<p>Question No. 389 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1057,"content":"<p>Question No. 390 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1058,"content":"<p>Question No. 391 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1059,"content":"<p>Question No. 392 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1060,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1062,"content":"<p>Question No. 394 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1063,"content":"<p>Question No. 395 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1064,"content":"<p>Question No. 396 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1065,"content":"<p>Question No. 397 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1066,"content":"<p>Question No. 398 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1067,"content":"<p>Question No. 399 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1068,"content":"<p>Question No. 400 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1069,"content":"<p>Question No. 401 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1070,"content":"<p>Question No. 402 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1071,"content":"<p>Question No. 403 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1072,"content":"<p>Question No. 404 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1073,"content":"<p>Question No. 405 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1074,"content":"<p>Question No. 406 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1075,"content":"<p>Question No. 407 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1076,"content":"<p>Question No. 408 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1077,"content":"<p>Question No. 409 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1078,"content":"<p>Question No. 410 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1079,"content":"<p>Question No. 411 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1080,"content":"<p>Question No. 412 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1081,"content":"<p>Question No. 413 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1083,"content":"<p>Question No. 414 answered with Question No. 385.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":1084,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400083#WRV00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1085,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[26092\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400083#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of teachers working in primary and secondary schools, respectively not including special education teachers in tabular form.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.  <\/p><p>A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022.  <\/p><p>Funding provided by the Department is for food costs only.  My Department does not impose any costs on parents.  All other aspects of the operation of school meals projects, including set up costs, are the responsibility of the school\/group.  The choice of school meals project and supplier to be used, as well as all financial and health and safety aspects, is the responsibility of the school\/group. <\/p><p>As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 children for the 2019\/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities. <\/p><p>In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Invitations for expressions of interest were issued to 705 primary schools (612 DEIS and 93 non-DEIS) in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children. <\/p><p>The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area. <\/p><p>Budget 2022 is providing for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the 81 DEIS schools that submitted an expression of interest but were not selected in the extension to 35,000 children as referred to earlier. <\/p><p>The number of children currently in receipt of hot school meals is 54,236.  This represents almost 10% of the total primary school population.  There are no secondary school children in receipt of hot school meals as it is aimed at primary schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  <\/p><p>The estimated additional cost of providing a hot meal to all the primary school children currently in receipt of school meals is approximately &euro;47.85m. <\/p><p>The estimated additional cost of providing a hot school meal free of charge to all DEIS primary school children is &euro;54.8m. <\/p><p>The estimated overall cost of providing a hot school meal free of charge every school day to every primary school child, secondary school child and every child attending a special school is contained in the attached tabular statement. <\/p><p>I am committed to continuing to grow the hot school meals element of the school meals programme for DEIS schools and building further on the significant extension announced as part of Budgets 2021 and 2022.  In this regard, I have commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme to be undertaken in 2022 to inform future policy decisions on the scheme. <\/p><p>Any extension of the school meals programme or the hot school meals beyond 2022 will need to be considered as part of the budgetary process. <\/p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position for the deputy.  <\/p><p><b>The estimated cost of providing a hot school meal to every primary, secondary and special school child<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>School Type<\/th>       <th>Hot Meal<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Primary <\/td>       <td>&euro;288.7m <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Secondary <\/td>       <td>&euro;181.4m <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Schools <\/td>       <td>&euro;4.4m <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Cost <\/td>       <td>&euro;474.5m <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400085#WRX04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1245,"content":"<p>Question No. 468 answered with Question No. 467.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1246,"content":"<p>Question No. 469 answered with Question No. 467.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1247,"content":"<p>Question No. 470 answered with Question No. 467.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1248,"content":"<p>Question No. 471 answered with Question No. 467.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Government Communications","counter":1249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400085#WRX05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1250,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[26122\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400085#WRX05300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the ministerial contact details for persons (details supplied).

The holding of an oral hearing is at the discretion of the Appeals Officer. <\/p><p>Oral hearings have been successfully conducted online and, as an alternative, by telephone since October 2020 and these types of hearings will continue.  This remote hearing approach has proven to be an effective way of facilitating an oral hearing previously achieved through the holding of an in-person hearing.  An in-person hearing will only be held in any case where it is deemed essential by the Appeals Officer.<\/p><p>It is not possible to state how many appeal cases may require an oral hearing at any one time.  However, for those appeals where it is identified that an oral hearing is required, a hearing can generally be arranged within approximately two weeks.  The length of time each individual oral hearing takes depends on a number of factors including the circumstances of the case and the number of attendees.  A fairly typical hearing takes approximately an hour to conclude.  The position in relation to the conducting of oral hearings is being kept under review by the Chief Appeals Officer.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  <\/p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, average appeal processing times have generally improved between 2018 and 2021 from 30.0 weeks for an oral hearing in 2018 to 25.5 weeks in 2021, and from 24.8 weeks for a summary decision in 2018 to 13.9 weeks in 2021.

This lead to a situation where there was variation in the number of ECCE weeks a child could qualify for, ranging from between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child; although in reality almost no children used the 88 weeks as this would require starting in ECCE in April, close to end of the programme year.<\/p><p>The introduction of a single entry point  aligned to the start of the primary school year ensured that all children could receive 2 full years of ECCE, or 76 weeks. This also ensures that all children can experience the full pre-school curriculum. In making this change, the minimum age was also reduced to 2 years 8 months. This has made the scheme more equitable in terms of eligibility than the older system.<\/p><p>A single entry point has also streamlined the administration process for providers, making it easier for them to operate and budget for the programme year. In addition it has made it easier parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.<\/p><p>The minimum eligibility age of 2 years and 8 months for the ECCE programme was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years education and care in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios.<\/p><p>The decision making process was informed by representations and feedback from parents, providers and other stakeholders received over the course of that particular approach being in place. Concerns raised generally related to the disparity of entitlements depending on month the child was born and the issues with integrating children into established groups in middle or towards the end of a programme year.<\/p><p>I would note that my Department is currently in the process of appointing a consultant to undertake a 12 month review of the ECCE programme. The purpose of the Review will be to assess whether the ECCE programme is being implemented as intended,  assess whether it is meeting its core objectives and identify any enhancements that can be made based on international evidence and experience.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400087#WRZ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":1333,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400087#WRZ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1334,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[25885\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400087#WRZ01800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the budget that has been granted to the International Protection Accommodation Services to meet the housing need of persons arriving here from Ukraine; the number of contracts for service the International Protection Accommodation Services has entered into for housing and catering services in respect of same; the duration of each contract; and if he will provide a schedule of all contracted service providers in this regard.

While the applicant may be living independently from his mother, SUSI found he does not meet the age criteria to be classed as an Independent Student he can only apply as a Dependent Student and as such must be assessed with reference to his own income and that of his mother. The student referred to by the Deputy has been awarded 50% Rate of Student Contribution by the awarding authority SUSI based on Dependent Status. If the student experiences a change of circumstances once his course commences, the student can then submit a request for an Internal Review under Change in Circumstances to SUSI.

Reforming core funding including the allocation model must be positioned within a wider context of performance, governance and reform across the tertiary education and training system being driven by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  At present the Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions. Funding is distributed via the Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM) which currently utilises a 'two pot' system. The Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM) is allocated through a funding formula. The formula is driven by audited prior-year student numbers. These are weighted for the relative costs of providing education in different disciplines.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) appointed an independent Expert Panel to review the current allocation model for funding higher education and to make recommendations on the most appropriate funding model for the future. The completed\u00a0review recommends reforms to the HEA funding distribution model. A key recommendation was that (in principle) the future funding model should adopt a universal approach to supporting all higher education institutions facilitated by the development of a Costing Model applied consistently across Higher Education Institutes.<\/p>  <p>  Aligned with the significant transformation of the sector in terms of the development and designation of Technological Universities, the implementation of this recommendation requires consideration in the context of\u00a0the sustainable model of funding for higher education.\u00a0 In this regard, on the 4th\u00a0of May I launched Funding the Future, a landmark policy on the future of higher education.<\/p>  <p>  Funding the Future, which was approved for publication by Government, settles the question on sectoral funding Higher Education. The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our commitment to addressing legacy issues in higher education and detailing our ambitious plans for investment and reform.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the framework, my Department will engage with the HEA to develop and implement the necessary changes and updates to the\u00a0funding distribution model to ensure it aligns with and facilitates key reforms necessary.\u00a0 The objective of this process is to ensure a\u00a0transparent funding model which reflects sectoral developments, encourages high quality teaching &amp;amp; learning provision, excellent research and the achievement of key strategic objectives.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This will be supplemented\u00a0through the development of\u00a0a comparable\u00a0reporting process\u00a0with the\u00a0sector, which will inform the consideration of future strategic policy objectives and outputs. This will build on the progress realised from the RFAM report and will be further\u00a0informed by\u00a0the recent report\u00a0between the HEA and the OECD on resourcing higher education.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to be clear that the funding model is the means to allocate the agreed level of available recurrent funding to higher education institutions. Changes to the allocation model may alter the allocations that are ultimately provided to individual institutions, however such changes should not, in their own right, be a cost increasing or decreasing measure in terms of the overall allocation that will be available for distribution to the institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400088#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Visas","counter":1384,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400088#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1385,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[26053\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400088#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has engaged with the Minister for Justice in relation to the situation in which  language students on stamp 2 visas are being forced to leave the State at the end of May 2022 after two years even if they have to return for a post-graduate course in September 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1386,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department regularly engage with their counterparts in the Department of Justice in relation to the student immigration system and this matter has been discussed in that context.

This announcement followed on from the publication of the results of a widespread consultation process, (which included in-depth consultations with various civil society and community groups, academics and experts), a public consultation process and a detailed comparative study of approaches to hate crime in five other jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the extensive consultation was to ensure the government&rsquo;s proposal was based on the lived experience of those impacted by hate incidents.<\/p>  <p>  On 16 April 2021 I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. The aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty, compared to the ordinary offence, and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.<\/p>  <p>  Following its publication, the General Scheme was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny, which took place on 17 November 2021. The Committee published its report in April and its recommendations are being considered as part of the drafting process.<\/p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the recently published Justice Plan 2022, I intend to publish the Hate Crime Bill in the summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400089#WRBB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence","counter":1488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400089#WRBB05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1489,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[26292\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400089#WRBB05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the expected timeframe for the publication of the new national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1490,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV) in all its forms, and to ensuring that people, particularly women and vulnerable people, feel safe and are safe in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I am currently leading work on a new whole of Government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.\u00a0The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners.\u00a0Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the\u00a0national drugs and alcohol strategy\u00a0\"Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025\". This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland.\u00a0The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach\u00a0- reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at\u00a0reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use.\u00a0While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across Government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continued unabated throughout the pandemic,\u00a0bringing\u00a0significant\u00a0convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that on 2\u00a0July 2021,\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy,\u00a0Operation Tara,\u00a0which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Recent successes of Operation Tara include:<\/p>  <p>  - Garda&iacute; arrested and charged 3 men in Co Louth following the seizure of an estimated &euro;90,000 worth of drugs on 10 May;<\/p>  <p>  - A man and a woman arrested by the Galway Divisional Drugs Unit on 11 May following a seizure of &euro;70,300 of suspected cannabis;<\/p>  <p>  - An estimated &euro;400,000 worth of drugs seized and two persons arrested in Cork on 09 May;<\/p>  <p>  - Approximately &euro;1.5 million found in follow up searches in the Newbridge area of Co Kildare after a man was arrested in Meath on the M1 with &euro;39,750 in cash in his vehicle.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All drugs seized are subject to analysis by Forensic Science Ireland (FSI).<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m, &pound;142,520 (UK) and $23 (US) was forfeited to the State in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to acknowledge the work of the Garda&iacute; in tackling the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. The reports of further sanctions from the US recently demonstrate the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  The cooperation on this investigation has been ongoing for four years or more, but the actions taken in recent weeks really show the degree to which the international criminal justice sector is focused on tackling the criminality associated with the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. We should not take for granted the huge achievement of the Garda&iacute; in patiently and quietly harnessing this necessary coalition of support for their work to combat this criminal group.<\/p>  <p>  The sanctions enforced internationally should send a very clear message to those involved in the gang, or associated with the gang; that your criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400090#WRCC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1518,"content":"<p>Question No. 561 answered with Question No. 560.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1519,"content":"<p>Question No. 562 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1520,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400090#WRCC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1521,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[26494\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400090#WRCC02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of cold cases currently under investigation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1522,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Serious Crime Review Team was established in 2007 under the direction of Detective Chief Superintendent, Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and its primary purpose is to assist Senior Investigating Officers in the investigation of serious crime by identifying new and investigative opportunities which require consideration of progression.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The process of serious crime review is also intended to shape future investigative and operational practices based upon the lessons learned and the identification of good practice for dissemination back in the investigative and operational units.

The HSE&rsquo;s Incident Management Framework is applied to the management of individual incidents and is the mechanism for incident investigations in the HSE, including maternal deaths.

The OEST has an initial staffing requirement of 4 Whole-time Equivalents (WTEs) including a Clinical Director, Midwife and case managers. Funding of &euro;540,000 was provided to support the establishment and expansion of the OEST from Budget 2022 through the Estimates process. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the OEST is to support the networks as they respond to the events in terms of overseeing and advising on appointment of the review panel, family engagement, conduct of the review, finalisation of the review report and follow up. In addition to assisting the health services in responding to severe maternity related incidents and in the provision of appropriate supports for patients and families, the OEST aims to ensure appropriate expert level support is available nationally by enabling learning from adverse maternity incidents to be actioned at a national level and by promoting engagement with relevant stakeholders across the maternity network.

It will further inform progress on the Sl&aacute;intecare programme, which aims to support people to live in their own homes with dignity and independence, for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory home-support scheme, which the Department of Health is currently developing. The new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services for people based on their assessed care-needs.<\/p>  <p>  This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support services. With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view of bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.<\/p>  <p>  The aim is to ensure that service-users are safe-guarded and protected, and a responsive, person-centred, quality-driven home-support service is provided. This is central to the Sl&aacute;intecare objective of providing &lsquo;right care, in the right place at the right time&rsquo;. The regulations being drawn up by the Department and the standards being drafted by the HIQA both take cognisance of the diverse and often complex needs of those who require homecare and support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  HIQA has extensive experience in the regulation of social care services and has conducted wide-ranging research into the regulation of home-support services. HIQA ran a public scoping consultation in September 2021 to inform the development of National Standards for Home Support Services. HIQA has convened an Advisory Group, with representation from the Department of Health, to assist in the process of developing the Draft National Standards.<\/p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites.\u00a0The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.\u00a0 The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme.\u00a0A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400095#WRHH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1859,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400095#WRHH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1860,"qnumday":675,"qnumall":"[26439\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400095#WRHH03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the provision of transitional plans to ensure that young persons with a disability who wish to reside outside of nursing home settings and who wish to live independently have sufficient choice and options available to them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1861,"content":"<p>Nursing homes are an appropriate care option where the person concerned has a clinically assessed complex medical and social care requirement which cannot be supported in the person&rsquo;s home.

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical\/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multifaceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT). The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Based on information provided by companies involved in the recent HRT shortages, we now appear to have entered a stabilisation period in supply. During this stabilisation period, it is essential that patients do not seek supplies of medicines over and above their normal requirements as doing so will disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for others. Following a meeting with key stakeholders involved in the supply of HRT products to the Irish market it was agreed to establish a multi-stakeholder group to closely monitor the supply of HRT until the issue is fully resolved. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400095#WRHH06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1887,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400096#WRJJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1888,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[26471\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400096#WRJJ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of community optometrists contracted to provide services by CHO area in 2020 and 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1889,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400096#WRJJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1890,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400096#WRJJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1891,"qnumday":685,"qnumall":"[26474\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400096#WRJJ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) can expect further correspondence from the HSE in relation to a complaint that they submitted via Your Service, Your Say on 27 April 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1892,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400096#WRJJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":1893,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400096#WRJJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1894,"qnumday":686,"qnumall":"[26479\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052400096#WRJJ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the situation being reported in County Wexford in which no dentists are accepting new patients with medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1895,"content":"<p>I am aware that a significant number of dentists chose to leave the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) during the pandemic and that this led to some medical card patients having difficulties accessing treatment under the Scheme.
