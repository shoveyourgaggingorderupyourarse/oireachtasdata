The Deputy is correct.  The average farm income last year, as estimated, is directly related to the fact that in the dairy sector the average income has fallen from nearly &euro;68,000 in 2014, which is a very good income for an average farm income, to &euro;47,000.  However, there has been better news in all of the other sectors.  There has been an increase in the cattle rearing, other cattle, sheep and tillage sectors.  Incomes were increasing in all sectors except dairy last year.  Farmers will be aware that there was a very significant drop in dairy commodities internationally and the base price for milk prices fell substantially.  As a result, the sector that is traditionally the highest income sector is still the highest income sector but the average income has fallen from nearly &euro;70,000 to approximately &euro;47,000, which is still quite a good average compared to the other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  That said, the dairy sector is in transition at present.  Many farmers are investing to expand and grow.  There has been investment of approximately &euro;1 billion over the past three to five years on Irish dairy farms in preparation for expansion and growth post-quota.  That is happening.  Last year, despite the dairy price drop, there was a 13% increase in dairy output, so there is still a great deal of belief and confidence in the dairy sector.  We introduced a &euro;25 million package to support the dairy and pigmeat sectors.  Due to the price drop farmers received a support payment of approximately &euro;1,400 each, with a top-up of &euro;800 for young farmers.  We are supporting this sector.  The sector understands price volatility and that this is a temporary problem.  It also understands that we will help it get through it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100003#A00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1453368600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We are talking about a drop of income in the dairy sector from &euro;68,000 to &euro;48,000.

With regard to income in the other sectors increasing, the Minister will be aware that incomes in those sectors are very small.  Is he concerned that this huge drop in income in dairying will put many farmers, particularly new entrants, in dairy farming under pressure, just as they have made these big investments?  The amount of money paid in the package is very small compared to an average loss of &euro;20,000 in income.  What will be done here and in the EU to address this issue after the abolition of quotas?  It is a serious issue.  They are not all in the same situation.

I speak to representatives of co-operatives and to dairy farmers on a regular basis.  To put this in context, in 2013 and 2014 there were exceptionally high global prices for dairy products, and dairy farming was a profitable business with average incomes of nearly &euro;70,000.  In 2012, the average income was &euro;49,000, which is very similar to what it was last year.  The price drop last year, which was very dramatic, was disguised somewhat by the fact that we had a very good grazing season.  Grazing right up to December was good on many dairy farms, so the quality of milk was very high.  Farmers were getting bonuses on top of a low base price, which was disguising the fact that the base price had fallen so low.  The concern this year is that when spring milk comes out, the farmers are unlikely to have that quality of milk because animals will have been kept in on silage, so a very low base price would be concerning.  Obviously, we must do everything we can to work with the Commission to ensure we use the market intervention tools available to the European Union to try to get the base price for commodity traded dairy products back to some type of normality, which is significantly higher than the level at present.

I have had meetings with all the CEOs of top banks in Ireland and they have made it clear to me that they see their role as helping dairy farmers who have high debt.  Most dairy farmers do not have high debt but some of them do.  They see it as their role to help those dairy farmers get through what they see as a temporary pricing problem.  In the medium term, everybody is still optimistic and confident around where the Irish dairy industry is going.  We have had a difficult year last year from a volatility point of view, which is continuing into this year.  The predictions are that in the second half of this year there will be an improvement in price and dairy factors have to factor that in, in terms of how they manage their businesses.  Banks that are financing the expansion in some of these businesses also have to factor that in and I believe they will.

The National Inshore Fisheries Forum has invited the Department of Social Protection to its meeting today to discuss social protection policies relevant to the inshore fishing sector.  <\/p>  <p>  The new Seafood Development Operational Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund was adopted by the European Commission in December 2015.  That programme provides a comprehensive range of supports for the seafood sector worth &euro;241 million, including a dedicated scheme of supports for the inshore sector to address the various economic and sustainability challenges facing the sector.  In regard to specific measures to support fishermen affected by significant losses arising from adverse weather events, the EMFF and the operational programme provide for the establishment by fishermen of a mutual fund for adverse climatic events and environmental incidents, which when established can provide aid to fishermen affiliated to the fund in line with pre-defined rules.  The operational programme will co-fund the mutual fund, together with subscriptions from member fishermen.  In that sense, the viability of such a mutual fund is dependent on the extent to which fishermen commit to membership of that fund.<\/p>  <p>  Following the December adoption of the programme, I launched the initial tranche of schemes last Thursday at the Government press centre with the support of the European Commission.  Further schemes will follow during 2016.  For some of the inshore fishermen, particularly in the Celtic Sea, where there is a artisan herring fishery, we have sought to carry over a quota that could not be caught in December into January and February to ensure that what they lost because of bad weather in December carries over into this year.

I give the Deputy a commitment that I will explore the opportunities available, but it will not be easy for us to say the European Union has to give us a quota, given the fact that there was a basis for the decision made and that bluefin tuna stocks are about the most sensitive in the Atlantic.

The market determines the price for beef.  Let us consider the performance in price in the past five years and compare Irish beef prices versus the EU 15 countries or 28 countries.  We have seen that in the past five years for the first time we have pushed on past 100% of the average price of the EU 15 and EU 28 countries.  In previous periods under previous Ministers, the figures were far lower.  In 2009, we were at 90% of the EU average and in 2010, we were at 91% of the EU average, whereas in 2012, 2013 and 2015, we were well above the average.  We need to put this into context in terms of how Irish beef is seen.  I am keen for it to be seen as a premium product and for it to be higher priced than the average across the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, we have an important relationship with the United Kingdom because more than half of our beef exports now go to the UK.  I am keen to see the gap closing rather than opening up but there is a series of reasons there is a price gap.  The main reason is that British consumers want British beef first.  After that, they are happy to take Irish beef, which they see as very good.  All of the research shows this.  As a result, most of the retailers want to buy British beef first.  Then they will buy Irish beef to meet the extra demand that exists.  Therefore, there is a higher percentage of British beef going onto the shelves of supermarkets in Britain and that is the highest price segment for beef.  The higher the percentage that goes into that higher price segment, the higher the price those involved can pay for British cattle versus Irish cattle.  It does not take a genius to figure that out.  Given the country of origin labelling rules, this is the reason all British supermarkets want to sell British beef first.  Only three of them actually stock Irish beef but they are the big three and that is why we have huge volumes going in there.  Exchange rates have added significantly to this in the past 12 months but the main reason is that there is a far higher percentage of British beef going into the higher value markets in Britain, which is the highest value market for beef in the world, than the percentage of Irish beef.  We will continue to market and work to get more Irish beef into that higher value market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100006#D00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1453370400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>It is funny that others in the European Union are not half as sanguine as the Minister about the dominance in the market of a small number of retailers and processors.

Actually, we have facilitated the live export trade in recent years.

Livestock was also lost in the floods.<\/p>  <p>  While the problem of preventing regular flooding of agricultural lands at risk is one that requires an integrated inter-agency response, the immediate problems facing the worst affected farmers must be dealt with directly and at first hand.

To deal with this problem, I operated an emergency welfare scheme to provide the worst affected farms with short-term emergency feed.  To date, 136 farmers have benefited from this scheme, receiving 360 tonnes of concentrate in total, some of which was dropped in by helicopter in south Galway.<\/p>  <p>  As the floods continued unabated, a significant number of farmers experienced damage and losses to stocks of fodder and feed.

As of Tuesday last, 183 applications for support had been received under the scheme.  On-farm visits will be undertaken by Department personnel in all cases to confirm the quantities of fodder lost due to flooding.  The closing date for applications is tomorrow, Friday, 22 January.

Another factor is that US beef prices have fallen back from the peaks recorded in early 2015, which makes beef imports less competitive.  More important, the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe in 2015, particularly in the UK, meant US buyers may have been priced out of the market, as Irish exporters chose to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent.  While the volume of beef exported to the UK in 2015 was largely the same as in the previous year, it increased in value to represent 54% of the exported beef from Ireland compared to 47% the year previously.

I am conscious there is huge frustration in Donegal and in the north west generally about this fishery, which extends to the Aran Islands.  There is frustration because the Celtic Sea fishery has been profitable and progressive in recent years with strong quotas and so on.  We had a robust and difficult conversation about the north west fishery last month.  The science has changed and the advice is that the basis for the setting of quota or, in the case of the north west herring fishery, the non-quota, for the past number of years, is flawed in terms of understanding the two herring stocks off the north of Scotland and the south of Ireland and how they interact with each other.<\/p>  <p>  We have agreed with the Commission that we will determine what quota is allocated on the basis of a new estimate of our understanding of how the two stocks interact with each other and allowing time to produce a more accurate assessment.  I have insisted that the southern stock will get at least 30% of whatever is allocated.  Last year, the northern or Scottish quota was 20,000 tonnes and, therefore, it has gone from that to zero.  We have stayed at zero but I hope we will have a figure in February.  It will be much less than 20,000 tonnes but we will insist on a fair share of that.  I promise the Deputy that when we do, the inshore fishing fleet will get a fair share of whatever we secure to ensure we have an inshore fishing option for small boats off the north west coast right down to the Aran Islands to catch herring.  Everybody knows that I have made it clear to the big boys and the small boys that this is what I want to do.  We will have a good news story for the inshore fishing fleet towards the end of February when we will have a number.  I will make a commitment and even if I am gone from this office, I hope it will be followed up.  This will be a new option for the inshore fleet in the north west.

Our dairy system, which is the fastest growing sector in Irish agriculture, is producing milk at the lowest emissions intensity on the planet along with Austria and New Zealand.<\/p>  <p>  The point I am making is that we need to get better at doing that in agriculture.  We need to reduce the emissions intensity.  We are the only country in the world to measure emissions intensity at a farm level.  We are measuring the carbon footprint of the herds on 46,000 beef farms - the emissions coming from those herds.  Every dairy farmer in the country - all 17,000 of them - has signed up to a dairy sustainability programme which will involve a sustainability audit system on farm in those dairy farms to understand emissions, feed conversion efficiency, efficiency of the herd generally, animal health, protection of biodiversity and all the other measurements and benchmarks around sustainability.  This is the way it should be.  We need to keep pushing and encouraging farmers to do more around sustainability.  We are spending &euro;4 billion in the rural development programme.  Some 70% of that money is focused on sustainability, on a GLAS or a beef genomics scheme, and on more efficiency and on ensuring we produce more efficiently at reduced emissions.  <\/p>  <p>  When I come across as being a bit defensive about our sector, it is not because I do not believe in the awesome challenge of climate change and the need for agriculture to respond to that.

To support the sector, the Government committed itself to taking various actions to rebuild competitiveness, grow business and increase employment.  The first of these measures to reduce value added tax, VAT, on tourism services from 13.5% to 9% was taken in 2011 and has greatly enhanced the competitiveness of the industry.  This measure was complemented by a radical change in our approach to visitors from developing markets through the visa waiver programme.  The programme has made travelling to Ireland and Britain easier and more convenient for visitors from these developing long haul markets, such as India and China, which are important markets for the future.<\/p> <p> In 2013, we had The Gathering which, as Deputies know, was a highly successful initiative because it was backed not only by the Government but by communities in every county.  It brought hundreds of thousands of extra visitors to events across the country, as well as a substantial increase in visitor spending.<\/p> <p> In the 2013 budget, the Government extended the employment and investment incentive scheme to include tourism accommodation.  The scheme allows investors to claim income tax relief on qualifying investments.  It was extended for a further three years in budget 2015.  <\/p> <p> The zero rating of the air travel tax, announced in budget 2014, has also had a very welcome impact on increasing air access to Ireland.  It led to the provision of additional capacity on many existing routes, as well as the introduction of more than 20 new services.  <\/p> <p> In tandem with the hard work of the industry and the tourism agencies, these initiatives have helped to support very welcome improvements in the numbers of overseas visitors and revenue.  From a position in 2010 where the number of overseas visitors had fallen to a low of 6.1 million, we have seen their numbers increase every year since 2011.  In 2014, we attracted 7.6 million overseas visitors to Ireland and these visitors contributed an estimated &euro;3.5 billion to the economy.  I am pleased to report that the picture for 2015 was, again, very positive.  The most recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures for overseas travel show that there were more than 8 million visits, an increase of 14% for the first 11 months of the year when compared to the same period in 2014.  Even without the final month&rsquo;s figures, we know that 2015 was a record year for overseas visitors, with an expected figure of 8.2 million visits, surpassing the previous record year of 2007.<\/p> <p> Spending in Ireland by overseas visitors has also increased strongly.  It was worth &euro;3.58 billion in 2014 to the economy, an increase of 22% on the 2010 figure of &euro;2.9 billion.  When combined with domestic tourism, the industry is worth approximately &euro;5 billion a year.  The figures for 2015 look very promising, with revenue for just the first nine months standing at more than &euro;3.3 billion.  I am confident that when the final figures are available, it will be another high point for Irish tourism.<\/p> <p> The increased activity in the past four years has also meant that tourism has been a major contributor to job creation.  The most recently published figures by the CSO show that employment in accommodation and food services in the third quarter of the year had increased by 18,800, or 16%, to 139,900 since 2011.  In total, taking into account other areas of tourism and hospitality, F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates 205,000 people work in the tourism and hospitality sector.  These jobs are spread across the country, often in places where other opportunities are limited.  These jobs are also available to people with a range of skills.<\/p> <p> The great progress made in the past five years does not mean, however, that the Government can divert its attention away from the sector.  We cannot become complacent or rest on our laurels.  Continued growth is not guaranteed.  To fully develop the potential of the sector in a sustainable way, we need to constantly review our policy and the investment required.  With this in mind, I will turn to the new tourism policy which the Government has developed to ensure tourism will remain a central part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth.<\/p> <p> Last March, the Taoiseach launched the Government&rsquo;s new tourism policy statement entitled, People, Place and Policy, Growing Tourism to 2025.  It provides a framework for the tourism industry to thrive in a changing global tourism marketplace.  The three headline targets of the new statement are: spending by overseas tourists in Ireland to rise to &euro;5 billion per year by 2025, net of inflation; that there will be 250,000 people employed in the tourism industry by 2025; and that we attract 10 million overseas visitors to Ireland by 2025.  To achieve these targets, we have looked at Irish tourism and asked how we can make the most of its two key strengths: its friendly and welcoming people and the quality of things to see and do.  The new policy is focused on building on these twin strengths of people and place.<\/p> <p> In this regard, the Bill is essential to delivering that policy because it will allow continued capital investment to develop and improve the attractiveness of Ireland as a place to come and in which to holiday.  Fundamentally, it is the quality of the destination that is the primary factor which inspires potential visitors to come to Ireland or holiday at home.  More specifically, virtually no one goes on holiday because of the quality of the hotel bed in which he or she sleeps.  Important as that is, the real driver of holiday visitors is the number of places to see and things to do.  Our challenge is to maintain and enhance the quality of our range of attractions and activities.  Our core tourism offering must continue to improve and change to stay relevant to what potential visitors are looking for.<\/p> <p> Tourism capital investment has been and will continue to be central to keeping Ireland as a great place to visit.  Capital investment in tourism can improve the visitor experience and support economic development.  When this will not happen on a commercial basis, the Government needs to step in to support it.  As set out in the tourism policy statement, our focus in developing Irish tourism in the coming years will be on the most promising potential visitors in each of our priority markets.  The new experience brands of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East and Dublin - A Breath of Fresh Air have been designed with these potential visitors in mind.  Accordingly, as set out in the new policy, future capital investment will support the development of these experience brands.<\/p> <p> The success of the Wild Atlantic Way shows the potential of this approach.  It has already exceeded our expectations in how quickly it has caught the imagination of tourists, as well as communities along the route.  We are continuing to invest in the route and the things to do along it and its profile gets stronger every year.  The lessons learned during its development have guided the development of Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, the aim of which is to build on the rich history of the south, east and midlands in places such as Clonmacnoise, Newgrange, mediaeval Kilkenny and Waterford.  The vision is that it will give visitors the opportunity to experience 5,000 years of European history in a small, compact area.  It is early days but it has the potential to attract a significant number of visitors to these areas and generate revenue and jobs in many rural communities.  As with the Wild Atlantic Way, businesses and communities in Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East need to become fully involved to make the most of the initiative.  If they do, I have no doubt that it will be a big success.<\/p> <p> Dublin also is the subject of a major brand experience project.  We all know that last year was a really good one for tourism in Dublin, with the city thronged with tourists and hotels full throughout the summer.  However, we need to look to Dublin&rsquo;s long-term appeal and guarantee that, whatever happens in external markets or however currencies fluctuate, it will continue to attract visitors and compete with other city destinations overseas.  The new brand for it will show off its unique position as a vibrant capital city that is also incredibly close to mountains and sea, an experience not found in most other cities.  Capital investment will support this brand development.<\/p> <p> Future capital investment focused on these key areas will play a vital role in developing Ireland as a destination, as it has done in the past.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Since F&aacute;ilte Ireland was established, almost &euro;140 million has been invested in projects such as walking and cycling routes, tourist visitor attractions and facilities for visitor activities.  Among the notable projects that have been allocated grant aid are: the Dublin heritage trail; Waterford Viking triangle; Sliabh Liag cliffs in Donegal; Athlone Castle; Mizen Head Bridge in west Cork; the great western greenway; King John&rsquo;s Castle in Limerick; Castletown House in County Kildare; the historic towns initiative; the development of the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East; Killarney House; the medieval mile in Kilkenny; and Spike Island.<\/p> <p> Spread across the country, these investments have enhanced their local areas and regions and strengthened their tourism sectors.  It is essential to provide for capital investment in such projects into the future and this gives rise to the need for the Bill before the House today.<\/p> <p> I will now deal with the purpose of the Bill in detail.  The National Tourism Development Authority Act was passed in 2003 to dissolve Bord F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann and CERT Limited and establish the National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Section 24(1) of that Act gives the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the power to advance, out of money provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine.  Section 24(2) limits the total amount of money over a series of years that can be advanced by the Minister to F&aacute;ilte Ireland as capital expenditure on projects or enterprises.  However, annual funding allocations are made in the normal way through the Estimates and budgetary process.  This limit on total capital funding was originally set at &euro;65 million but was later increased to &euro;150 million under the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Act 2011.<\/p> <p> Taking into account the 2016 capital allocation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, investment in tourism capital is now approaching that limit.  Once the spending limit has been reached, no further voted capital moneys may be advanced to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for tourism capital investment projects.  Accordingly, it is prudent to legislate now for an increase in this limit.  Taking into account the allocations under the Government&rsquo;s capital plan - Building on Recovery Infrastructure and Capital Investment - the Bill proposes raising the limit to &euro;300 million to cover anticipated annual allocations over the life of the plan.  The Bill also clarifies that it is now with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, rather than the Minister for Finance, that the Minister may advance moneys to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I am introducing this Bill to make these necessary legislative changes and I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100010#H01900","speaker":"1074","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453374000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill before the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the Bill, which is technical in nature.  Its purpose is to enable the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to advance a higher aggregate budget allocation to the National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting enterprises and projects relating to the development of tourist traffic and also tourist facilities and services from &euro;150 million to &euro;300 million.  I have sought this in the past and it makes eminent sense.  We support the increase in the advance budget cap for the authority and will support the passage of this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's tourism industry has seen its visitor numbers grow consistently in recent years.  Overseas visitors spent an estimated &euro;1.535 billion in the State in the first half of 2014.  Revenue from overseas visitors grew by nearly 9% between January and June of this year, which is an additional &euro;123 million compared with the same six-month period in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  We are always concerned about visitors' length of stay.  I understand visitors have been staying longer in recent times.  The number of nights spent in Ireland by overseas travellers increased by 13.4% in the second quarter of last year compared with that period in 2013.  Much of this is testament to the fact that throughout Europe, people are moving out of a recessionary environment and the concept of controlling their spending to a great degree.  We are well poised to benefit from that.  During harsher times and times of austerity, even people who have money are much more controlled in how they spend and they limit their holidays to an absolute minimum.  That has reduced the number of nights people stay.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il in government launched A Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, many of the proposals of which have resulted in the upswing in tourist numbers in recent years.  We are pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has worked on that strategy document and added to it as he saw appropriate.  We have largely taken a bipartisan approach to this aspect of our economic development.<\/p>  <p>  In order to remain competitive in the global tourism market, Ireland must ensure that the quality of our services remain high, that prices remain reasonable and that access to our ports and airports increases.  The savings created by the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector must be passed on to the consumer.  Obviously, with an upswing in certain sectors of the economy, the people in that sector must be mindful of the burden placed on a particular sector to provide that 9% VAT rate.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of its introduction, I disagreed with it being taken from the pots of private pension holders, putting many of those pension funds in a perilous state.  Many people are only now realising that measure will reduce their pension delivery in perpetuity.  Even though the money was only taken for a three-year period, it was taken from the capital base of those pension funds and will impact on the pay out from those funds for the lifetime of those receiving them.  It is vital that the industry is cognisant of the burden placed on those people and that it continues to pass on the savings from that reduced rate.<\/p>  <p>  While the tourism experience offered in Ireland is unrivalled, we cannot rest on our laurels.  Since The Gathering, the Government has neglected tourism product development and domestic and overseas marketing.  I do not say that ignoring the context in which the Government had to manage its budget.  As the economy is starting to recover, the focus must be on the development of the product.  As sure as night follows day, tourists will not come back for the same experience, save in very rare circumstances.  They want to see enhancements, new developments and new opportunities.  Even those who have the greatest connection to this country expect to see the experience enhanced and evolve with modern thinking and generational expectations.<\/p>  <p>  This is reflected in a 17.5% reduction in funding since 2012.  While recent trends in tourism are encouraging, there is a risk that a proportion of the increases in visitor numbers is due to the euro devaluation against the dollar and sterling.  While we can all complement ourselves - I can do so in respect of the previous strategy that was developed and the Minister of State, his party and the Government can take credit for their input into that strategy - collectively, we must all be mindful of external factors such as the cost of oil, which provides cheaper access to the country by air and sea.  Reduction in fuel prices at the pump encourages and increases domestic activity.  From a broader perspective the differential between euro and sterling and the dollar certainly makes Ireland attractive as a destination in addition to what we have to offer.  We must be cognisant of that in coming years.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot afford to neglect the overall quality of the tourism offering in the country.  The Government has a key role in supporting tourism product development, regional balance and domestic and overseas marketing.  I am minded of a product development fund of approximately &euro;50 million that existed in the past.  Even though it was done under the Administration I was part of, at the time I felt the money was spread too thinly - trying to have something for everybody, which is a frequent tendency for any Government.<\/p>  <p>  In the future, we need to look to the big bang approach.  We need to be very careful in the spending of such money.  It should not be seen like the sports capital programme, which is important in terms of putting money into every community.  I might have differed with the Minister of State on the exact way some of the moneys were spent.<\/p><p>It was based on per head of population and the Department used a <i>pro rata<\/i>algorithm to disperse funding.  We cannot take the same approach to a product development fund from a tourism perspective.  We have to look at the country as a whole and the major attractions that would increase the tourism influx to a greater extent if we had these signature offerings.  If the Minister of State occupies the same portfolio after the general election, I hope he will give cognisance to major signature attractions that would benefit the entire country.  Then with the smaller tourism opportunities we can target people when they are here.  Nationally, we have to portray ourselves to an international market that is looking at the major attractions.  Further innovative projects such as the Wild Atlantic Way are required, with the goal of increasing tourism numbers overall and, more especially, promoting a more even distribution of tourists across regions.  Undertaking targeted initiatives to promote a more balanced regional distribution of visitors is a key plank of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s tourism policy.<br\/><br\/>The figures for overseas tourists are strong, with an 11% increase in 2015 compared to 2014.  Those of us involved in politics should not be taking all of the credit.  We must recognise the staff of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the fantastic work they do.  It is comparable to the work done by IDA Ireland in attracting foreign direct investment.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland does an excellent job in marketing and targeting particular sectors overseas.  At over 8 million, the number of overall trips to Ireland was up 14% in the first 11 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.  The number of visits from mainland Europe grew by 15.9% in the period January to November 2015 to 2,850,000.  North America registered an increase of 14.2% in the same period, with almost 1.5 million visits.  The number of visits from Great Britain was up by 12.5% to over 3,250,000.  We had a difficulty for several years in working the UK market.  Some of this was due to the fact that parts of the United Kingdom were suffering the same economic circumstances as we were.  The differences between the sterling and euro exchange rates have been helpful in rectifying this.  However, we need to build on it.  The number of visits from the rest of the world, mostly from long-haul and developing markets, totalled just short of 500,000 for the first 11 months of 2015, which represented an increase of 13%.  There is a considerable amount of latent capacity in the Middle East and Asian markets.  It is an area we have failed to capture and not mastered, as well as our neighbours in the United Kingdom.  There are issues around visas and access, but we should not exclude it from our sights.  I know that it is a costly market to target, but our ex-pat community could be energised more in spreading the word and encouraging activity from these regions.<br\/><br\/>The figures should primarily be seen as a vote of confidence in the quality, attractiveness and novelty on offer from the Irish tourism, hospitality and food sectors.  Without doubt, the 9% VAT rate has helped to keep costs more manageable in the sector in the past few years.  However, I have heard many outlandish claims by Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies that the special 9% VAT rate is the sole reason for the surge in the tourism industry this year.  It is a contributory factor for sure, but it is not the sole reason.<br\/><br\/>While the 2015 numbers are remarkable, without a well placed strategic vision for tourism development and promotion, there are significant risks to future growth in the sector.  It is a constantly evolving market and we need a Government that understands the role of tourism policy.  Rather than smugly trumpeting short-term gains in tourism figures, the Government needs to put in place a strategy for developing new products and capturing new markets.  Current tourism policy strategy is not well placed to develop new tourism products and respond to changing tourism patterns.  After all, there are significant risks to achieving the 2025 target of attracting 10 million overseas visitors.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s chief executive, Mr. Michael Cawley, recently highlighted the risks when warning of a possible downturn in tourism figures due to capacity issues, potential price gouging and a lack of regional balance.  Record numbers of visitors in 2015 were due to a low VAT rate and the strength of the dollar and the pound.  According to the Mr. Cawley, the 11% growth in visitor numbers last year was &quot;fuelled largely by factors external to the tourism industry,&quot; including the weak euro, in particular.  This, he said, &quot;masked an underlying cost creep&quot; in the tourism sector, something we need to address.  His background is well recognised and his capacity for cost containment in growing markets, particularly given his experience in the aviation sector, is legendary.  When someone like him expresses these concerns, it is not done on the basis of something he has read but is innate to his DNA.<br\/><br\/>We need a more ambitious tourism policy.  The recently announced national tourism policy, People, Place and Policy: Growing Tourism to 2025, is lacking in ambition.  The Government aims to increase the number of overseas visitors to 10 million per annum by 2025.  However, it should be more ambitious, given the wider outlook for tourism in Europe.  With additional resources, we believe Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland could be well placed to meet these targets by 2020.  The long-term sustainable growth of Irish tourism is being put at risk by a lack of adequate funding for tourism marketing and development.  I hope increasing the borrowing limits may provide the agencies with greater capacity in this regard.  Since 2012 annual Government funding for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland has been cut by 17%, or &euro;25 million, to &euro;119 million, resulting in significantly constrained budgets for tourism marketing and development.  With the economic upturn, more revenue is available and it is important that we fight for a fair share of the funding at the Cabinet to develop this important sector of the economy.  This has come at a time when tourism has shown itself to be an excellent investment, contributing over &euro;6.45 billion to the economy annually and employing 205,000 people.  Every euro spent on tourism marketing and development by the State supports &euro;54 in tourism revenue in the economy, an excellent return on investment by any standard.<br\/><br\/>Tourism is a changing market and we need to develop new products to reflect this.  The current tourism policy strategy is not as well placed to develop new tourism products and respond to changing tourism patterns.  We especially need to spend on research and marketing budgets to tap into new markets.  The Asia-Pacific region will be one of the fastest growing outbound tourism markets in the next 15 years, expanding by 6.5% a year.  Visitors from this region are particularly attractive for Ireland.  On average, they stay twice as long, spend and travel more within the country than visitors from nearer markets.  However, we do not know nearly enough about tourism patterns to tap into new markets to take advantage of emerging trends.  As Mr. Michael Vaughan, former president of the Irish Hotels Federation and a fellow Clare man, said:<\/p><blockquote>We know more about the travel patterns of the 6.8 million cows on the island than we do about the 6.5 million visitors to our shores each year.  It is shocking how little we know about tourism.<\/blockquote><p>He is right about that.  This is expensive.  The infrastructure and architecture that was put in place to track our livestock was built up over years with a good deal of investment.  We need considerable investment not only in our analytics but in our data capture and in our approach to capturing that information.  It would be money well spent and provide a valuable resource to the marketing gurus within the various State agencies and those in the private sector who act also as ambassadors for this State.<\/p> <p> While F&aacute;ilte Ireland has set aside &euro;5 million specifically to promote conference tourism, it is unfortunate that we have a major catch up to play in this area with the loss of the Web Summit next year.  I am on record on this and the Minister of State and I have largely agreed on the impact its loss will have on our reputation internationally and it is difficult to know what impact its ultimate loss will have on tourism to the capital and the rest of the country next year.  However, it is unlikely that F&aacute;ilte Ireland even with this new budget will be able to make up for the loss of such a prestigious, high profile event as the Web Summit.  It has put Ireland centre stage for the past four years, bringing the chief executive officers of large multinationals as well as the small start-ups from the world's most innovative technology companies and has shown them the best that Ireland has to offer.  It also represents a huge loss from the tourism point of view with an immediate loss of &euro;100 million to the economy next year.  It is unfortunate that more was not done to keep the Web Summit in its home and that the Government, and more specifically the Taoiseach, could not step up to the mark and secure its future for Ireland.<\/p> <p> I do not want to get into the politics of it and we have talked about it in the past.  It is a significant loss from a reputational point of view and it shows to some extent a lack of flexibility, notwithstanding perhaps the difficult demands that were made at the time.  As the Minister of State will be aware, requests were made several times to have four specific issues addressed to secure the long-term future of the summit in Dublin.  These included traffic management, public transport, hotels and Wi-Fi, all which were raised constantly during the last four years with the Government.  None of these requests should have proved insurmountable.  The Government has failed Ireland with the loss of this highly reputable global event.  It has failed to secure future business in Dublin worth over &euro;100 million annually.  Ireland's loss is certainly Lisbon's gain.  In the medium term I am sure the bed nights will be filled some other way.  The prestige attached to the Web Summit had benefits that far outstripped the bed nights or the restaurant covers that are lost.<\/p> <p> Another pressing challenge facing the industry is the need to attract more visitors to the regions.  Unfortunately, recent growth in overseas visitors has not been spread evenly across the country and many rural tourism businesses continue to face tough trading conditions.  Tourism is one of the world's fastest growing industries, and its potential for the Irish economy is very significant.  As a labour-intensive sector, it has a strong role to play in employment creation across a range of skill levels in every part of the country.  This is a major challenge given the vital social and economic role that tourism employment plays particularly in rural areas outside the main urban centres.<\/p> <p> Developing further regional initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way in an effort to spread the increasing tourist numbers across the country are a key priority in the area of tourism for our party.  A regional balance in tourism visitors makes sense from the point of view of promoting sustainable tourism as well as increasing the benefit to under-developed local economies from the sector.  Initiatives designed to distribute tourism across regions will also ease congestion in particularly popular areas at peak season.<\/p> <p> The development of our canals, walkways and forests as further tourist attractions should be a priority in this regard.  The success of the greenway in the Minister of State's county of Mayo is a good example of innovative thinking resulting in increased tourist numbers in the regions.  A significant amount of work has been done in developing a lighthouse on Loop Head in County Clare and it has created a nice attraction and has attracted quite a few visitors.  Clare County Council also recently purchased an island, Inis Cealtra, on which there was once an ancient monastic settlement.  The island is located on Lough Derg and the intention is to develop it as a tourism attraction.  That will require money from the State.  If I am fortunate enough to be re-elected to the next Parliament, I will push whoever is in government to secure appropriate funding to develop that attraction and the ancillary services that will be required.  As it is an island, significant investment will be needed on the shoreside to put in place an interpretative centre for the island and to provide visitor access to it.  Many of these types of initiatives grow from local interests, from small local groups getting together to identify potential.  That needs to be very much part of the thinking around product development. <\/p> <p> Internationally, the Ireland brand does not distinguish between North and South so our tourism strategy should also look to greater co-operation on tourism on both sides of the Border.<\/p> <p> Another good example of an initiative to distribute tourism was the Wild Atlantic Way, a tourism trail on the west coast.  The 2,500 km driving route passes through nine counties and three provinces, stretching from County Donegal's Inishowen Peninsula to Kinsale, County Cork, on the Celtic Sea coast.  Along that route there are places and attractions previously little known to tourists, which have been designated as points of interest for travellers.  The creation of the Wild Atlantic Way has increased tourist numbers along the route and has acted as a counterbalance to the pull of Dublin to tourists.<\/p> <p> There is a need for the tourism agencies to identify, appraise and pursue new areas of potential in regions with low tourism numbers, which may have a particular competitive advantage, including food tourism, eco-tourism, film and television production, cruise tourism, the wider Irish diaspora, music, literature and the arts and the niche markets, for example, retired travellers, activity tourism and the health and wellness sector.<\/p> <p> One of the Government's signature achievements in tourism marketing, The Gathering, was thought-out and developed in 2009.  The Government has worked well with that strategy.  If our party is successful in the election, I am sure we will continue to embrace and build on any of the work the Government has done with that strategy that was developed.  That is in keeping with that bipartisan approach to tourism development in this State.<\/p> <p> Similarly the comprehensive interdepartmental policy, A Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, was a blueprint of my party when it was in government and was published in September 2010.  Many of the recommendations contained in this strategy were implemented by the Minister of State and I compliment him on that.  Those include the excise tax reductions on short-haul flights to encourage visitors from price sensitive, established markets, particularly the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain; increasing return on investment in attractions by enhanced packaging, joint marketing and by making access easier through times, passes, tickets, transport, signage and websites; enhanced opportunities to market and compete for business tourism, including packages specifically promoted such as meetings, incentive travel, conferences and events, and trips that result from more generic promotion where the trip includes both leisure time and business time, an example being the development of the Conference Centre; and the promotion of cruise tourism which included gateways as well as some of the rural harbours and ports and some expansion of that especially in Dublin. <\/p> <p> As a country, we have many challenges in continuing to make our cities, towns, villages and countryside some of the most attractive places in the world to visit.  For the most part, it is the people who are working in the tourism and hospitality sector, as well as the people of Ireland, who will do the most work to meet this challenge.  However, the Department, the tourism agencies and local authorities have a key role in devising tourism promotion strategies and policies.  For all these bodies, we cannot get carried away with the success we have had in attracting tourists during the past number of years and we must not rest on our laurels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100012#K00200","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453375200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Tourism is ferociously important right around the country.  In fairness, in recent years many proactive initiatives have been taken.  Many times we come into the House and attack Ministers for things that are not done but, in fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has been proactive.  I refer in particular to the VAT rate which has been of considerable importance to struggling hoteliers around the country.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State shares my concern about bed spaces in Dublin.  The prices are rising.  Increased numbers of tourists are coming to Dublin but there are other places around the country that might not have benefited to the same extent.  It is necessary to strike the balance and to remain competitive.  We cannot return to the previous high price of hotel beds.  We must be competitive in order to encourage people to keep coming to the country rather than going elsewhere.  We must be aware of the balance required once the price of beds begins to get out of control.  We must also ensure that we focus on the areas that have not benefited as much.<\/p><p>That is a challenge that faces the country.<\/p> <p> As a nation we must ensure that if one sector begins to improve, we do not lose the run of ourselves and damage the sector.  There have been tourism benefits due to the strength of sterling and the dollar.  We must ensure we take an aggressive approach in order to capitalise on getting more people from England and America to come here.  This country is an attractive destination at the moment and we must put our best foot forward and sell the country well.<\/p> <p> When a film was being made on one of the islands many do-gooders were trying to stop people from going there.  We must ensure that we encourage the film sector and other initiatives which will benefit the country's tourism in any way.  That is of the utmost importance.  Many people visit Scotland and there may be things we can learn from the Scots.<\/p> <p> The Wild Atlantic Way has been a great success.  It is a trophy project that can be shown to all.  In that context we must ensure that the likes of Knock Airport becomes a hub for people, which will boost the area as well.  The River Shannon has considerable potential.  In the context of the recent flooding I suggested constructing a canal from the Atlantic Ocean in order that cruisers and other boats could move along the Shannon and along the canal to Dublin.  That could be a new tourism initiative and is worth thinking about.  Initiatives are required on the rivers Shannon and Suck, as County Roscommon needs a boost.<\/p> <p> I agree that bed space has been a major problem in many counties.  During the recession hotels got in trouble and were closed or taken over by the banks.  In fairness, many of those premises are starting to open again and we must ensure we have incentives in place.  In fairness to Roscommon County Council, it is helping people to get up and running step by step.<\/p> <p> I would like to see a renewed focus on counties that do not get as many tourists.  Every county has something unique about it.  We must put our heads together to see how we can ensure tourists who are in Dublin for a day will go to Mayo, Kerry or Roscommon for another day.  We must get the most out of people while they are here.  I am involved in a hotel project in Roscommon which with a bit of luck will be open in the next couple of months.  It is like building a house in that one must put in foundations before one can bring people there.  There are some great people involved in the hotel industry.  For example, Gleesons in Roscommon has constantly gone abroad to promote the area.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland must liaise more with such people.<\/p> <p> We must ensure we have the infrastructure in place.  For example, it would be of great benefit if we had rail links to ensure connectivity.  In the west there has been a missed opportunity in the context of trans-European transport networks, TEN-T funding, as we might have been able to extract some money from Europe to put infrastructure in place.<\/p> <p> The web summit will be a loss to this country but that will not be felt this year or next year because bed spaces are full.  I do not wish to get into the blame game of who lost or won it but we must ensure we learn from where we went wrong in that regard and see whether we can rectify the situation.  Sometimes one must swallow one&rsquo;s pride and go to a person and get him or her on board again.  There will always be toing and froing and arguments but ultimately, it is about getting people into the country.<\/p> <p> In the west, Roscommon, for example, has potential because of the rivers Shannon and the Suck.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland must try to work with people.  One issue on which I was vocal as I found it very hard to accept is the approach taken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to planning.  It made life difficult for businesses that wished to put up signs.  The Department took a hard line with people who put up roadside signs advertising that they were open for business for meals or other services.  We must ensure that we are not foolish in that respect.  It does not make sense to tell a person to take down a sign when it is for their business and they are generating money.  We must ensure that things are done properly but we should not obstruct people at a time when they are trying to get off the ground with their business.  People need to advertise their businesses in all parts of the country, especially in those areas where fewer people travel.<\/p> <p> Infrastructure is of the utmost importance around the country.  The tourism sector is going in the right direction.  Tourist numbers are on the increase, which is good.  It is a success story and I will not give out about it.  However, if one is going well, one must ensure that one has a plan to go even better.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, if he is in the job after the election, or whoever else is in the job, must keep up the pressure.  We are starting to develop something that can be even greater if we keep exploring new approaches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100014#M00300","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453375800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Deputy Jim Daly is sharing time with Deputies Anthony Lawlor and Jerry Buttimer.

The investment of an additional &euro;150 million in the tourism sector is a very good story.  However, I must ask who knows about it.  We are inside in our little bubble but there is very little traction for this in the real world.  I have my own view on how F&aacute;ilte Ireland does its job and it is not always positive.  I have some experience of it over the years dating back to a time before I was a public representative when I was the head of the tourism body in Clonakilty district Chamber of Tourism.  The experience of F&aacute;ilte Ireland is that it is overly bureaucratic, there is too much paperwork and too much use of language which puts challenges and difficulties in people&rsquo;s way.<\/p>  <p>  This country&rsquo;s most unique selling point is our people.  Visitors who come here love the scenery but what most of them talk about is the friendliness of the people.  Tied in with that is our unique community spirit.  The allocation of an additional &euro;150 million to F&aacute;ilte Ireland is a missed opportunity.  I would much prefer to see even a third of it - &euro;50 million &ndash; going to communities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, oversaw one of the most successful ways of tapping into community spirt and getting a real return for money, namely, sports capital grants.  Every community is involved and goodwill is engendered.  Many good ideas come together and people work together to generate new sports initiatives.  I would like to see a similar approach taken to tourism.<\/p>  <p>  West Cork is the area I represent and it is heavily reliant on tourism revenue.  There are many wonderful community groups with good ideas for generating tourism products but their hands are tied because there is no opportunity to get funding.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland refers to iconic movements but it does not deliver to communities on the ground that want to grow products in order to attract people to their areas.  We are all very proud of what we have to offer.  We have wonderful scenery in west Cork, amazing heritage, history and geography but we want to sell it.  I would love to see these funds being passed down to smaller communities to harness the enterprising spirit not just of people in west Cork but all over the country.  However, that will not happen with F&aacute;ilte Ireland because in my experience it is too difficult to access funding for community groups.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness to local authorities, they are very proactive but their funding stream is minimal.  It is very difficult for people to access funding to develop a capital project to grow a tourism product.<\/p><p>In west Cork we are trying to develop the west Cork walkway which I envisage will one day rival the Camino in Spain.  One will be able to get off an aeroplane at Cork Airport and walk all the way to the Mizen Peninsula.  We will not build greenways or anything like them; rather we will provide signage and take some very low-key safety and practical measures to allow people to have a real and genuine experience in west Cork.  There will be massive demand for such a product.  I have been talking to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, but it is impossible to get any encouragement from it.  It uses a lot of jargon and highfalutin language, but I get no concrete assistance from it.  To be fair, I have asked the local authority to head up a local forum to include Cork Airport, the council and a number of other bodies in the area, to try to progress a west Cork walkway as an aspiration.   The CEO, Mr. Tim Lucey, and his team have been extremely proactive and helpful in trying to develop the concept.  It would be a real product and I use this occasion to commend everything that has been done.  <\/p> <p> I agree with all previous speakers on the great successes of the tourism industry.  I was elected not only to continue in the current vein but also to question what we do, how we do it and whether we could do it better.  Capital could be expended better and allocated better to communities.  We could better tie in with the community entrepreneurial spirit to grow the product in local areas because there is a wonderful spirit of volunteering throughout Ireland.  Unfortunately, as I have no faith that F&aacute;ilte Ireland will do this, I would like the Minister of State to examine the proposal and the possibility of introducing something like the sports capital grant in order that every community would be aware of the available moneys and be able to apply for them to develop a tourism product in order that Tourism Ireland could be even more proud to sell the product abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100015#N00300","speaker":"994","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453376400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and acknowledge his enthusiasm.  He seems to be present at every event associated with tourism or sport in which he encourages people to become actively involved.  <\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy Jim Daly, I will speak more about what Tourism Ireland could do locally rather than nationally.  More than 8 million people visited Ireland in 2015, but one must remember that there is an indigenous local tourism industry.  Instead of travelling abroad, people stay in Ireland - most families stay local.  I will focus on where the sume of &euro;15 million could be spent locally.  We have a very good body in Kildare - Kildare F&aacute;ilte.  It struggles to obtain funding from local authorities and would love to get its hands on some of the additional &euro;150 million being given to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The body which is run by Phil Donnelly of Newbridge Silverware and which also involves Bridget Loughlin in the Kildare heritage office has identified a number of facilities in Kildare where funding could prove useful.  There is Ireland's Ancient East and Castletown House which we have identified.  There are so many things around Castletown that people could visit, but there is no funding available to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for local projects, something at which we could look.<\/p>  <p>  When I look at what Kildare has to offer, two of the main thoroughfares through it are the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal.  I welcome the transfer of funding from Galway to Maynooth and Mullingar.  The Grand Canal links Dublin almost the whole way to Waterford and one can either walk or cycle it.  We need funding to open it up in order that people will be able to use that facility, whether they are local or from outside.  Last week I highlighted Arthur's Way which extends from where Arthur Guinness was born in Leixlip to where he is buried in Oughterard, along the Grand Canal.  It is a great facility, but we need to extend it further.  <\/p>  <p>  Many tourists pass through Kildare on their way from Dublin to places like Westport and do not have an opportunity to stop.  We would like them to stop at the facilities we have available.  I will list them.  As Deputy Jim Daly said, they receive very little support from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  There are racetracks such as Punchestown where a well known international meeting is held every year and which brings attracts tourists from all over.  It works hard at this, but it needs assistance from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We have bogs such as that at Lullymore which is a tremendous facility.  We also have the National Stud and, as I said, the canals.  I would like the Minister of State, if possible, to transfer some of the money going to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to the NTA in order that it could open up these routes, whether for international or local tourists who use the facilities all the time.  It is important that funding drop down to organisations such as Kildare F&aacute;ilte which could distribute it to local communities and which is actively encouraging people, locally and internationally, to use the facilities mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100016#O00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1453376400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>We are privileged to have a Minister of State with such vision and calibre in the Department who can listen to people like Deputies Jim Daly and Anthony Lawlor and me and take on board our views.  Deputy Jim Daly is correct and I thoroughly concur with him on the ability of F&aacute;ilte Ireland to deliver, in the case of Cork, a strategy and joined-up approach to the promotion of the tourism region in Cork.  From my experience, Cork city and county councils have been very proactive and are willing to engage and, to borrow the clich&eacute;, walking the talk in terms of investment and plans.  The Bill is about advancing moneys to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for the tourism sector, but for some time I have been saying both to the Minister of State and in public that we must, in the case of Cork, market it as a single destination and the gateway to all of Munster when it comes to attracting tourists.  I accept that we are getting closer and that some work has been done.<\/p>  <p>  Next week the Cork strategic tourism task force will launch at Cork Airport a collective strategy for growing tourism in Cork.  Having a collective strategy is key.  We must use this opportunity to in the next decade market Cork as one region, including west Cork, the city, Blarney, north Cork and east Cork.  The marketing of Cork has not been treated with the urgency it has deserved by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  With the new strategy, we must have in place an implementation team to put it into action.  In the news this week the DAA, Mr. Kevin Toland and the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, extolled the virtues of Dublin Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority.  In the south we have a duty to represent and advocate for our region.  Do the Minister of State, the Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have responsibility for ensuring the strategy being launched for Cork is a success?  Deputy Jim Daly made reference, both directly and indirectly, to the fact that nobody had legal responsibility for growing tourism in Cork.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will state it deals with the bigger picture regionally and nationally.  The two councils have put strategies in place.  In Cork City Council Mr. Damien O'Mahoney and his team have been tremendous advocates and workers and have a great blueprint and vision to promote and develop tourism, but who is responsible?  To whom do we go and who we do hold to account on tourism numbers and for the promotion and marketing of Cork?  We can have all of the tourism strategies in the world, but if the buck does not stop with someone, the strategy will gather dust on a shelf and not be worth the time and effort given to it.  <\/p>  <p>  We now have an opportunity to develop what Deputy Jim Daly wants in west Cork and what I have done in the city.  The Deputy has been a tremendous advocate for west Cork and Cork Airport, as I have been in the city.  If we can do it on our own and hold meetings with stakeholders and engage to get buy-in, why can F&aacute;ilte Ireland not do so?  The time has come for the reports that have been compiled, talked about and launched to be put into real, concrete action.  This is about a Government which delivered for the tourism sector in its first budget.  This month we all received e-mails about the hospitality sector increasing hotel room rates in this city.<\/p><p>After the direct benefits given to the industry, is this what will happen over the next five years?  I challenge the hospitality industry to be realistic and not to be part of rip-off Ireland any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100016#O00300","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453377000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100017#P00200","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1453377000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>If managing tourism really is contemplated, explicit responsibility must be assigned in respect of developing and growing the local tourism brand, about which the Minister of State has spoken passionately and which he has implemented in his Department.  Aside from the Minister of State, a tsar also is needed to work with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and to resource that body and the councils, which are being asked repeatedly for matching funding.  There is only so much funding councils can give to promote tourism when there is an umbrella body, namely, F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I question the role of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in training people to work in the hospitality sector and in promoting the regional and the local.  I commend those who work in that agency, many of whom I know well.  While they are tremendous people, there appears to be a collective managerial buy-out about developing the local and the regional and this cannot continue.<\/p>  <p>  To revert to Cork city and county councils, I invite Members to consider the marketing focus they have brought to bear with regard to west Cork and Cork city.  They should consider the tremendous success of Cork City Council's Glow Christmas celebration this December, which brought people into a hive of activity.  Cork held a Christmas market and people wanted to visit and to be there, to sample the atmosphere and to engage in the festivities.  While unfortunately the weather was not so good, Members should note what it achieved.  Moreover, they should consider what the aforementioned councils do in respect of many other initiatives and festivals in Cork city and county.  I will provide the Minister of State with a simple example, namely, a website for Cork.  Where do tourists who wish to visit Cork go to see, to explore and to engage online to plan their trip before coming?  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has set up a group to put together the strategy for developing Cork.  While it has great tourism potential, it really is time to see boots on the ground in terms of tourist numbers and it is about time that the opportunities were examined along the lines of the Grow Dublin task force.  There have been years of false starts and the Minister of State might forgive some Members for being sceptical but they wish to see such an approach embraced.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to Cork Airport because having a proper tourism strategy also will help efforts to continue to grow passenger numbers at that airport.  I commend the airport management, which has been highly proactive and has engaged globally in its attempts to attract new passengers and new airlines, to open new routes and to generate new business.  In recent months there has been a significant series of announcements and the airport management has expressed confidence and is hopeful about the growth in passengers in the next couple of years and next year in particular, arising from new destinations and new airlines.  The most striking announcement was that of Norwegian Air International's plans to operate a direct Cork to Boston flight from May 2016, as well as a new Cork to New York route in 2017.  This is something towards which Cork Airport has been working for many years and when it comes to pass, it will pay a huge dividend in tourism and business for the city and county of Cork and the areas beyond them in Munster.  I raised the matter yesterday with An Taoiseach on the Order of Business and was delighted with his response to the effect he has raised the matter at the highest level in the United States.  It is a matter for the US Secretary of Transportation.  While I have not yet had the opportunity to speak to the Minister of State in this regard, I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I believe the Minister, the Minister of State and the Taoiseach should not merely approach the ambassador, H.E. Kevin O'Malley and the US Secretary of Transportation.  They also should go to the White House and speak directly there to ensure that Cork Airport gets this transatlantic link.  The US-EU Open Skies policy agreement is about facilitating airports such as Cork Airport to have this type of business, which is no threat to Shannon or Dublin airports at all.  Other recent announcements in respect of Cork Airport include direct flights by CityJet, which is offering regular flights to London City Airport.  Moreover, for the summer of 2016 it will fly to La Rochelle and Nantes in France.  Aer Lingus also has increased its capacity in 2016 in respect of Paris, Barcelona, Palma and Faro.  It is a positive development that Cork Airport is beginning to achieve passenger growth and this can be augmented and increased by a proper tourism strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I conclude by expressing my complete agreement with the remarks of Deputy Jim Daly - he and I may be singing from the same hymn sheet - by reiterating that furthering tourism in Cork will require F&aacute;ilte Ireland to change its cultural and attitudinal behaviour with regard to Cork and the surrounding region.  There is buy-in from the councils, the Department and public representatives but what is needed is the prioritisation of Cork as a tourism destination.  Cork has the urban streetscape, the shopping and retail and will have a convention centre.  It has a tremendous road network and rail line, hospitality, food, scenery and the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte of its people.  What is needed is for the authority, that is, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, finally to come on board and agree to deliver together with the people in Cork.  I am confident that with the leadership of the Minister of State, this will be delivered.  This represents a wonderful opportunity for Cork and is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the next 20 years to project and promote Cork in Ireland, across Europe and the world in order that it can be a gateway for Ireland.  This opportunity should be used and that strategy should be developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100017#P00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1453377000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Costello is sharing time with Deputy Conaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100017#P00400","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1453377000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>That is correct.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2015.  It is a short Bill but is quite important because it will double the amount of the State subventions that can be made available for enterprises and projects relating to tourism traffic and tourist facilities nationwide.  That is important because although we had a good year in 2015, for which I offer congratulations to the Minister of State and his senior Minister, nevertheless it is a sector that can be highly fragile and that always has received good support from the State.  This was demonstrated in 2011 when the Government entered office through the reduction by one third in the VAT rate charged in the hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%.  This was welcome and certainly incentivised and stimulated much tourism and tourist activity and I note we have reached a figure of approximately 8 million visitors per annum.  However, I do not believe the hospitality sector has responded in kind.  At the time the Government introduced the VAT reduction, Ireland was one of the cheapest hospitality sectors in Europe but is now one of the dearest.  In particular, the price of hotel accommodation has shot up and I note figures from Trivago suggest an increase of 28% in a 12 month period in Dublin, making it the ninth most expensive city in Europe.  Moreover, when one considers the exorbitant charges that are being put in place by the hotel sector, I am sure this is getting worse by the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100017#P00500","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1453377000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I am afraid I must interrupt the Deputy, as the clock is against us, and ask him to move the adjournment of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100017#P00600","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453377000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1453377000,"counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100017#P00750"},{"type":"speech","time":1453377000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice - the proposed boundary change between County Roscommon and County Westmeath; (2) Deputy Joe Costello - the reason local authorities refused 4,000 homes offered by the National Asset Management Agency that could have been used to tackle homelessness; (3) Deputy Michael McNamara - low-cost loans for farmers and rural enterprises through the rural development programme; (4) Deputy Brendan Griffin - outstanding issues relating to the management of Beat 3 of the River Laune, County Kerry; (5) Deputy Mick Wallace - the risk of a terrorist attack on Ireland by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria due to the ongoing use of Shannon Airport by the military of the United States of America; (6) Deputy Mattie McGrath - measures to process the backlog in farm payments including in the single payment scheme; and (7) Deputy Robert Troy - eligibility criteria for the Red Cross disbursement for flood relief for businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Michael McNamara, Joe Costello, Michael Fitzmaurice and Robert Troy have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100017#P00800","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1453377600,"counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100018#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453377600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The floods in December destroyed homes and businesses across the country, including farmlands and farm buildings.

Many do not have insurance and are facing a huge burden as a result of additional costs.  The families had the cost of renting or purchasing pumps during the peak of the storms.  Electricity use increased as heat was kept on in flooded homes and additional fuel was required for pumps and boilers that were kept going around the clock.  It was an unimaginable burden for many families.  The water has done insidious damage to family homes.  Carpets are destroyed and wooden floors and tiles have had to be thrown out and replaced.  Families have faced increased heating bills as a result of their efforts to tackle damp.  In many cases, septic tanks have overflowed.  There is the additional burden, from a health and safety point of view, of making safe people's lawns and the areas surrounding their homes as a result of leakage and leaching of toxicity from septic tanks.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, said the Government would be generous and fair with applications for assistance to help people deal with the damage, while all claims will be means tested.  The Irish Red Cross managed the applications for assistance for small businesses which were not insured and I understand this has had a drawdown of approximately 75%.  Families who suffered damage to their property and need assistance have had to apply to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection's Department.  This seems to be a far more detailed process and people are anxious that it is taking too long.  My personal experience is that the community welfare officers are doing the best they can but families are saying the waiting times are extensive and the criteria set do not seem to match the costs incurred and the burden placed on them.  <\/p>  <p>  I have a number of simple questions for the T&aacute;naiste.  Has she assigned any additional staff to assist the community welfare officers in the processing of these claims?  Will she issue new guidelines to the community welfare officers to cover all the reasonable costs of those who were uninsured?  Will she provide money upfront to people who are insured but who are waiting for insurance companies to process their claims so they can pay their bills?  If she has to put a lien on a claim at a later stage, that is fine, but she should take the burden from people who are facing bills for oil, electricity, pumps, replacement carpets and getting their homes back to some kind of normal state.  The T&aacute;naiste's Department has a responsibility to meet the basic and obvious costs associated with the trauma these people have suffered.

As a matter of interest, we initiated our emergency plans in Clare and in Tralee in County Kerry on 6 December.  In both instances, there were small-scale levels of flooding during the week of 4, 5 and 6 December.  If Deputy Dooley wishes to draw individual cases to my attention, where he would like to see families getting more, he might give me the details.  Certainly, the cost of pumps have been supplied.<\/p>  <p>  I have attended a number of the community welfare service clinics in rural areas and I have met and spoken to the community welfare officers who were on the ground during the floods right around the country.  Our staff and the senior staff in charge have also been around the country.  They have gone to all the co-ordination meetings of the Government group and agency groups dealing with the flooding.  As we speak, a significant number of payments have been made and, at this point in time, there have been payments to approximately 250 families to 300 families.<\/p>  <p>  We are expecting more claims to come in.  Our experience is that in the initial stages, many people do not make a claim or, if they do, it is for small-scale stuff such as bed clothing or clothing that has been destroyed.  If contaminated water has passed through a property, the claim is to replace foodstuffs and so on that have been contaminated.  There is then the second stage.  White goods, for instance, fridges and freezers on a ground floor, may have been destroyed.<\/p><p>What we do there is ask people to get estimates of what has to replaced and we work with those estimates as flexibly as we can.  That really depends on people bringing the estimates forward, although often people are not in a position to do so for several weeks, until the house has dried out.  In extreme cases, it could be longer and where there is very significant damage to a home, it could be months as it might be necessary to get engineering opinions and the OPW's opinion.  We have done that, for instance, in counties Clare and Galway, particularly south Galway, on previous occasions.  As Minister, I dealt with the aftermath of the disastrous floods that took place in the west in 2009 and the subsequent flooding in 2010.  In approximately 20 cases, families were given sanction to move home on the advice of the OPW, local authority engineers and their own engineers.  To date - I am talking about 2012 - approximately 14 families have moved and rebuilt homes on ground safer from flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100018#Q00900","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453378200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Is the T&aacute;naiste confident that her Department has issued the appropriate guidelines to community welfare officers to the effect that all reasonable costs associated with the damage done to homes can now be claimed from her Department?  It is a simple question.  She seemed to indicate that there may be a delay in some of the claims coming forward.  Will she pay on account, so that as people receive bills and have to pay the costs associated with the damage to their homes, her Department will pay an element of the cost at that time, while more moneys will be forwarded to families as and when they have a better understanding of what all the costs are?<\/p>  <p>  In simple terms, I want to know that the community welfare officers have a very clear understanding that the Department will cover all reasonable costs for those who are uninsured and that it will provide upfront payments for those who are insured, notwithstanding the potential for the home owner to make an insurance claim at a later stage, which does take time.  How that would work between the insurance companies and the Department is a matter which I am sure she can address.<\/p>  <p>  My greatest concern is for the people at the coalface who have suffered the trauma and pain associated with this.  More particularly, I am concerned about the additional costs associated with trying to get back into their homes.  They should not be placed in an intolerable situation of trying to borrow the money, being unable to borrow it and perhaps in some cases having to look to moneylenders or whatever to assist them.  We do not want that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I need assurance from the T&aacute;naiste that the community welfare officers have available to them the resources to deal with all reasonable costs.  In some cases, the costs will go beyond bedclothes or foodstuffs that are contaminated as a result of the waters.  They will include floor coverings, damage done to doors and the cost of cleaning up the toxic substances that have been leached around lawns and driveways from septic tanks.  Some of those costs are additional and they are real.  There are also the costs associated with running pumps 24\/7 for three or four weeks.  There are the additional electricity costs, all of which need to be factored into the Department's ready reckoner, as it were, to provide the community welfare officers with a very clear understanding of what the T&aacute;naiste's is talking about when she says all costs will be covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100019#R00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1453378200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, it is essentially a three phase process.  First is the immediate emergency, for which payments tend to be small, covering things like foodstuffs and essentials that may have been destroyed or contaminated as a consequence of the flood.  In the second phase, it is up to people and it depends on how quickly the floodwaters recede.  Often people may stay elsewhere while leaving one person in the house.  It may be some weeks before they then claim for material damage to items in the house.  Such items can range from floorboards to white goods and electrical goods and furniture.  The third phase is when more substantial work may be required to the property.  In that case, there will almost always be some engineering or technical building advice required.  If the severity and the repetition of the floods are such in the particular location that there is a need to look at wider solutions, then in conjunction with the local authority and the OPW, the Department can do that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Dooley spoke about the issue of septic tanks.  Certainly, that issue has been raised on a number of occasions in the co-ordination meetings, both by representatives of the City and County Management Association and by Irish Water.

There is no better way of doing this than giving a comparative rundown to show how my county of Donegal has fared since the Government came to power.  There are 31,000 people suffering from fuel poverty, up 10,000 since 2014.  In 2013, 18,700 people were suffering from food poverty, according to a survey carried out by Mandate and Unite.  Outpatient waiting lists at Letterkenny University Hospital have soared by 70%, while the number seeking day case appointments has increased by 50%.  Some 60% of the population of the county have medical cards, while 16,241 were on the live register in December.  Up to 20,000 young people have emigrated from the county, leaving, according to the NASC, high levels of deprivation and high dependency ratios behind them.  Only eight of 149 electoral divisions have figures above the national average for deprivation indicators.<\/p>  <p>  The level of Enterprise Ireland supported job creation increased by 2% in the north-west region in 2015.  Ballybofey, County Donegal has the highest commercial property vacancy rate, at over 28%, according to An Post's geodirectory survey.  Some 52% of households in the county will have to rely on State intervention to get broadband and will have to wait until 2021 to see this objective realised.  Disposable income in the county is at 80% of the national average.  Social transfers make up 40% of household disposable income in the county.  A total of 1,485 farmers depend on farm assist to supplement their incomes, while 101 primary schools are working with reduced teaching staff.  Approximately 67% of third level students from the county are in receipt of SUSI grants.  According to the Central Bank, in February 2015 some 15% of homeowners were in serious mortgage arrears, with hundreds of repossession cases before the courts every month.  Add to this the cuts in expenditure, including the reduction of &euro;182,000 since 2009 for the Donegal Centre of Independent Living, and the resulting inability to provide care supports for people with disabilities in a county in which over 21,000 people are suffering from a disability.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, on the T&aacute;naiste's watch, according to the CSO, the top 10% of income earners in the country hold over 54% of income, with the top 1% holding 15% of its entire wealth.  Budget 2016 has accelerated this trend, with tax changes such as the cut in USC benefiting those on incomes of &euro;70,000 and above.  Is this a record of which the T&aacute;naiste is proud?  Based on this, why should the people of County Donegal and Ireland allow Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il another term in office?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100021#T01700","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1453379400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that commentary on County Donegal where he mentioned many people depended on social transfers.  That is the reason, as Minister for Social Protection, I was delighted to be able to restore the Christmas bonus, particularly for older and retired persons in the county who relied on their State contributory or non-contributory pension.  I was delighted to increase the percentage to 75%.  This meant payments for pensioner couples of &euro;320 before Christmas to help with Christmas expenses.  For a single person, the amount came to &euro;170.<\/p>  <p>  Thankfully the cost of oil and other fuels has fallen in the past year.  Notwithstanding this, because of the level of economic growth, on 1 January I raised the fuel allowance by &euro;2.50 per week.  Of the 400,000 households that will benefit from the improvement in the allowance, many of them are in County Donegal.  In addition, I was able to grant a small increase in the weekly pension rate to people aged over 66 years of &euro;3.  Many of these payments will find their way to people living in County Donegal.  Also, for those who do not have medical cards, last year we introduced doctor cards for children under six years and people aged over 70.  We hope that, if the electorate chooses to return the Government to office, during the life of the next Government we will be able to extend these cards to all primary schoolchildren and, ultimately, all children and various categories of older people.<\/p>  <p>  Having visited County Donegal this summer and spoken to many of those managing social protection offices and people working in the hotel business, I know that the county has seen a singular renaissance in tourism as a consequence of the Government's development of the Wild Atlantic Way.

This legislation would provide for a plebiscite to take place in the affected area and the results to be legally binding on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, has a set up a review to examine the county boundaries between Waterford and Kilkenny; Carlow and Laois; Louth and Meath; and Westmeath and Roscommon.  The people of Roscommon are very annoyed at this proposal, not least because they believe it is undemocratic.  The report to be presented by the boundary review committee is not legally binding on the Minister.  He must take note of it but he ultimately makes the decision under the Local Government Act 1991.  The Local Government Act 2001 would force a vote on that in the House but it has not been enacted.  The people and their representatives have no way of expressing their views on this except by making public submissions.  My Bill would facilitate that process.<\/p><p>I am completely opposed to the proposal to remove one in nine of the population of my county, as are the vast majority of public representatives and the people of County Roscommon.  It would make County Roscommon the poorest county in Ireland.  We are not talking about moving the town of Monksland into an urban district council in Athlone because the urban district councils have been abolished.  We are talking about making it a very small local area in a much bigger municipal district of south Westmeath.  It is not a case of putting like with like.  It is moving the town from one county to another.<\/p><p>This contravenes the proposals set out in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s policy document, &ldquo;Putting People First&rdquo;, which states that each municipal district should have at its centre an urban area.  It is proposed to move this urban area from the Athlone municipal district of County Roscommon into County Westmeath.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government recently responded to Roscommon County Council and was extremely complimentary about the local area plan developed for the Monksland area.  The Department&rsquo;s comments are unique and yet another arm of the Department seeks to move that into County Westmeath.  <\/p><p>The State has signed up to the European Charter of Local Self-Government which became legally binding on 1 September 2002.  Article 5 of the charter states: &ldquo;Changes in local authority boundaries shall not be made without prior consultation of the local communities concerned, possibly by means of a referendum where this is permitted by statute.&rdquo;  I am putting forward this legislation to permit it by statute.  The basic requirement that the people of Monksland and the surrounding areas should have is to be able to express their opinion by a vote on whether they wish to remain in County Roscommon or be annexed into County Westmeath and that decision will be legally binding on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>This measure is undermining the close co-operation that exists between Roscommon County Council and Westmeath County Council in respect of the RAPID programme, emergency and fire services, road maintenance, planning, water services and transport.  It is pulling the rug from under this co-operation.  If the Minister believes there needs to be stronger co-operation, let him provide for that through a statutory process rather than annexing part of one county. <\/p><p>There are several bluechip employers in the area.  Monksland is the midlands centre for the biopharmaceutical, food and information technology, IT, industries, employing close to 1,000 people, all of whom unanimously oppose this move.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to speak to her colleague, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and ask him at the eleventh hour to withdraw this proposal rather than proceed with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100025#X00500","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1453381200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>If it is in order to say so, I support this Bill.

laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 15th January, 2016.<\/blockquote><p>The ministerial order, which is before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, is a technical instrument.  Its purpose is to allow the D&aacute;il to approve formally the expenditure by Departments and agencies in the current financial year of capital moneys carried over from the previous year.  The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.<\/p><p>It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that, for a myriad of reasons, capital projects may be subject to delays.  The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys, which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year.<\/p> <p> As I said, this is a technical exercise.  The Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, generally requires the surrender of unspent Exchequer moneys to the Central Fund at the end of each financial year.  However, section 91 of the Finance Act 2004, which gives legal effect to capital carryover, allows the carryover of unspent voted Exchequer capital to the following year of up to 10% of capital by Vote, by deferring this surrender requirement, subject to certain conditions.<\/p> <p> Among those conditions are that the amounts of capital carried over by each Vote be specified in the annual Appropriation Act of the year from which the carryover is proposed.  The actual decision in principle on the amounts of carryover by Vote is therefore made in the Appropriation Act, which we debated last month.  The D&aacute;il again has the opportunity to endorse the amounts in its decision on the Revised Estimates Volume which shows the capital carryover amounts separately in the relevant Votes.<\/p> <p> The carryover amounts provided for in the Appropriation Act are required to be confirmed in an order to be made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by 31 March of the following year, after approval of the order by the D&aacute;il, to allow expenditure to take place.  The order sets out the amounts by subhead consistent with the amount by Vote specified in the Appropriation Act.  Capital carryover within a Vote does not have to be spent on the same subhead or programme where the saving occurred.  It may be spent on a different programme depending on progress and priorities.<\/p> <p> The order we are discussing today sets out where Departments and agencies propose to spend the capital carryover amounts specified by Vote in the Appropriation Act 2015.  The total amount proposed in the draft order for 2016 is &euro;111.8 million or 2.9% of the 2015 expected outturn.  The total 2016 gross Exchequer capital provision allocated in budget 2016 amounts to &euro;3.8 billion.  The capital carryover of &euro;111.8 million will bring the total Exchequer capital available for spending in 2016 to over &euro;3.9 billion, and allow projects to proceed in a number of Departments.<\/p> <p> Departments and agencies have delegated responsibility to manage their capital programmes and projects within the terms of the delegated capital sanction as set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The availability of these capital carryover amounts in 2016 will assist them within this framework in tackling economic and social infrastructural priorities in their respective areas.<\/p> <p> I commend the order to the House, as it will allow Departments and agencies to get on with the business of spending capital that the House has already allocated to deliver much-needed projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100025#X02500","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453381800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I welcome the Government's U-turn in allowing this debate today.

What is at issue today is the carry-forward of &euro;111.768 million of unspent money.  He made no reference whatever to why or in what areas this unspent money occurred.  There is no time for questions and answers.  It is a technical motion outlining what happened under the old legislation.  He did everything but refer to the reason for the carryover.<\/p>  <p>  We accept that such a carryover happens.  However, the Government is seeking approval for &euro;111.768 million of unspent capital money to be carried forward into 2016.  Shockingly, there is an underspend of &euro;41.078 million by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, primarily on housing.  Is it any wonder that there is a housing and homeless crisis when after all that happened last year with homelessness and people dying on the streets of the capital city, he was given &euro;41 million and could not spend it on the housing programme?

However, Sinn F&eacute;in was happy to vote with the Government on that and to vote for the deferred surrender of this &euro;111 million on that occasion.  I cannot see how it will have any problems with it today, given that Sinn F&eacute;in voted for this deferred surrender in the week before Christmas.  I will listen with interest to see what its Members say today having done something different then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100026#Y00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453381800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I am moved that the Deputy, it seems, is hanging on my every word.  I can assure Members that is a very rare occurrence in this Chamber and beyond, let it be said.<\/p>  <p>  We have no issue with the carryover of moneys that need to be spent and invested.  It is as simple as that.  We spend much of the time in the cut and thrust of political debate legitimately highlighting those areas that are screaming for further investment, whether that is capital investment or increased current spending.  The Deputy will not be surprised that I would not mindlessly oppose the Government for the purposes of opposition, knowing full well that these areas are screaming out for investment.<\/p>  <p>  I note from the Minister of State's contribution that the order identifies the areas where it is proposed to spend these moneys and make the investments.  I would have liked to seen from whence the underspend originated.  I hope the Minister of State is not presenting the figures to us in this manner to take the bad look away from certain things.  Certainly it is very necessary for the &euro;7 million for flood risk management to be invested, but we know that moneys that had been earmarked have not been spent at the scheduled rate.  While I understand there are reasons for it, above all else I understand the misery in recent times of so many families and communities.  This money needs to be invested.<\/p>  <p>  I note that in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, our friend, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, had an underspend of over &euro;41 million.  It is now proposed to spend that on the housing programme.  Bravo for that; it is not before time.  We know that there has been underinvestment and more than a reluctance on the part of central Government to come up trumps for local authorities and to invest in social and affordable housing.  I read this figure as symptomatic of the Government's approach.<\/p>  <p>  I note that there is more than &euro;6 million for the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p>There is a proposition for cultural infrastructure and development in the decade of centenaries commemorating 1912 to 1922, the centrepiece of which is 1916.<\/p> <p> Since we have this &euro;6.158 million, I suggest the Government, or the incoming Government, gets its act together and moves beyond the narrow definition of the national monument on Moore Street.  I suggest the Government moves to create a proper commemorative revolutionary quarter, encompassing the terrace and based from the GPO back as far as Parnell Square.  That would be a far more compelling development of that part of the city, which I happen to represent.  It makes cultural sense.  Kilmainham Jail is now a mecca for tourists, visitors, historians and the curious alike, despite the fact that back in the day, the State would have been quite happy to see that go.  Such a quarter in the heart of Dublin's north inner city would be an incredible tourist draw.  It would also be a massive economic driver for that part of the city which, historically, at least in parts, has been impoverished going back a century.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, will take on board what I said.  I think he is a sensible individual, more sensible than many of his colleagues.  As he is also a lot younger than many of us in this Chamber, I hope he would have an open mind in respect of what I am proposing.  It simply makes sense.<\/p> <p> This is a technical instrument which reflects the ebb and flow, the rhythm, or lack thereof, of government investment and spending.  As for Deputy Sean Fleming and Fianna F&aacute;il, I will not oppose the carryover of much-needed resources to be invested in critical infrastructure.

Ireland is a small trading economy and is more dependent on exports than any other economy in the European Union.  Our exports of goods and services represent about &euro;200 billion, which is more than the whole of our national income put together.  That shows the importance of the scale of exports.  When one looks at our export-oriented companies, between them, namely, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland companies, they employ 400,000 people.  Exports are at the very heart of our economic activity.  It is commonly recognised that for every job within the export-oriented sector, another one is created in the various supply chains and services.<\/p><p> Some 800,000 jobs are directly or indirectly dependent on trade in this economy.  That is a huge portion of our economy.  Members can understand why free trade and free trade agreements are very important to our country.  The negotiation of access to new markets historically has been a big driver of economic development in Ireland.  Members will recall that when we joined the European Union many years ago and this was a relatively closed economy and very dependent on agriculture, we had only 1 million people at work throughout the economy.  Now we have 2 million people at work, a doubling of the number of those at work.<\/p> <p> We have dramatically diversified our economy.  We have seen a huge growth in living standards and conditions in our country.  Opening up Ireland to trade has been a major part of our historical development.  The Acting Chairman will recall, as he has been around long enough as have I, that many of the negotiations around joining the European Union were hotly contested and many people opposed to joining argued to the best of their beliefs that our joining it would sacrifice employment, but we have seen employment double in the economy in the ensuing years.  There is a long history of people being concerned about trade agreements and that is appropriate but it also is appropriate to bear in mind that where trade barriers come down and countries get the chance to trade it is to the mutual gain of both countries.  The first lesson one learns in economics is about the mutual gains that people get from trade and the potential for growth and development of one's economy.  While it is right that negotiators should be vigilant and prepared for every eventuality in a negotiation, it is also important to bear in mind the potential gains that can take place, as our history clearly illustrates.<\/p> <p> When one embarks on a strategy of being open to participation in global trade, it imposes certain requirements and disciplines on the way in which one runs one's economy.  The recent history of Ireland's boom and bust gives us a very fresh reminder of how a small open economy can forget the importance of being competitive in export markets, and that it will do so as its peril.  In the early 2000s when the so-called Celtic tiger economy was at its height, only 1% of the jobs with respect to the jobs growth during the unprecedented growth between 2000 and 2007 were coming from exporting sectors.  This was building up an unsustainable reliance on sectors such as construction, the public service and other areas that was not underpinned by a trading competitiveness that is essential for any small open economy.<\/p> <p> By contrast, the recovery we have seen in recent years has shown a very different shape.  Some 40% of the 136,000 people who are now back at work are directly employed by export oriented companies and one can add another multiplier to that 40% with respect to indirect employment.  The recent history of our recovery has been very much centred around our capacity to compete and win in global markets at a time when there was very few sources of buoyancy in our economy.  Export growth was the key.  That is the context within which Europe has approached the free trade agreement and it has a comprehensive list of trade agreements it is seeking or, in some cases, has already negotiated.  Europe has also been struggling for new sources of growth.  Opening trade to new markets is crucial for Europe's long-term capacity to create and sustain jobs.  <\/p> <p> It is commonly recognised that 90% of the growth in the world economy will be outside Europe in the years ahead.  We have to negotiate better access and become more committed to those markets where growth will occur in the future.  That is very much true of the potential of the EU-US trade corridor as well.  About one third of all world trade occurs on that corridor, therefore, it is one that has huge potential importance for Europe and Ireland.<\/p> <p> The US is one of Ireland's largest trading partners.  Irish goods exports to the US are worth &euro;21 billion.  We have very close historical relations with the US and we stand to gain significantly from a successful emergence of a trade agreement provided it does the right things and opens up opportunities for us.  It is important we are vigilant in the course of that negotiation.  An independent study commissioned by my Department has flagged very significant potential gains, up to &euro;2 billion in terms of GDP, up to 10,000 in terms of extra jobs in exporting capacities and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  Significantly positive opportunities can be achieved through such a trade agreement. <\/p> <p> I was particularly pleased that I was in the chair of the EU Presidency when the negotiation of this agreement occurred.  It is worth reiterating to the House that when that mandate was negotiated it was founded on some important principles that have shaped the whole debate ever since and that are the bedrock of it.  One is that there would be no erosion of the protection of workers or of health, consumer and environmental standards.  A very important principle set out at the outset was that there would be no undermining of the right of Europe to regulate in the public interest, nor would there be any undermining of the procedures through which those regulations are developed in a democratic process and that there would be no erosion of the right of countries to run public services in whatever way they choose.  That has been endorsed since by a common declaration by both Mike Froman and Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m.  Also, there was a commitment that there would be greater transparency in the process of developing this agreement than there was in any previous one, and that has been very much a characteristic of this.  In addition and very importantly, any agreement must be approved by the European Parliament and must be agreed in each member state by whatever system that member state has for ratification of those agreements.  Those are very important principles and they have continued to dominate the consideration of the negotiations every since.<\/p> <p> To summarise the process of what has happened, the purpose of this agreement is to generate jobs and growth by reducing barriers to trade and investment.  It started with the appointment of a high level group in 2001, which did the scoping work on it and identified the areas where potential could be developed.  We then secured a mandate from member states.  A unanimous mandate was given to the European Union, to the Commission, to start negotiations on a very ambitious, historic, deep and comprehensive agreement, and there was very wide ambition on both sides to see this through.  To date, there have been 11 rounds of negotiations and they have focused on three separate pillars, namely, market access, regulatory co-operation and rules.<\/p> <p> Market access involves what we all would know about with respect to tariff, or non-tariff, barriers to trade in good or services.  In terms of the progress on that, a second tariff offer was exchanged, excluding agriculture, and both sides have now arrived at a level of proposal covering 97% of tariff lines.  Significant progress has been made on that.  In addition, teams have been finalised working through revised services and investment offers which aim at improving the conditions for transatlantic trade in both areas.  There has been some discussion on public procurement but, as Members will know, that is particularly important from a European point of view, it is a sensitive one from a US point of view but, from an Irish point of view, it is an area where there are real opportunities to be gained.<\/p> <p> The second bloc is around regulatory issues and, essentially, it is focused on co-operation in the area of how regulation is conducted.  It is not to change the regulations in either country - those are copperfastened by the principle that each bloc has the right to set its own regulatory approach in terms of public interest - but to reduce the cost of unnecessary red tape by making it easier for companies to comply with both EU and US laws while ensuring food, animal and plant imports are safe within the rules of each respective bloc.<\/p><p>It is about looking at where a pharmaceutical company, for example, has to run through all of the same tests in the United States that it has already completed against the same criteria within the European Union.  The intention is to recognise the equivalence of ways in which tests are calibrated, among other issues.  There are real opportunities in the more regulated sectors to have some common approaches to develop whereby there will be a recognition of the tests that occur in either.  That will not be at the expense of consumers or lowering standards.  Under an EU-US trade agreement, there would be no dilution of labour or environmental standards, no change to genetically modified organisms, no dilution of the right to regulate and no interference with public service provision.  That was set out in a joint declaration by Mr. Mike Froman and the Commisioner, Ms Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m.  The agreement also underpins the EU regulatory and democratic process, in other words, the way in which regulations are developed will remain the same.  It is significant that non-tariff barriers of the type in place are probably five or six times greater in terms of economic significance than tariffs.<\/p> <p> The third area is rules for trade-related issues and cover such matters as intellectual property rights, for example, so-called geographical indicators, in other words the right to call a product Parma ham if it was not produced in Parma, and energy investment.  These issues are the third strand.<\/p> <p> To outline some of the progress made, the one issue that has probably caused the most controversy in this House and which will no doubt be a feature in this debate is the investment protection system that it is proposed to include in the treaty.  It is right that people are anxious about it and will look very carefully at what is negotiated because there have been some very bad investment protection treaties negotiated in the past.  What the European Union is clearly setting out to do is to rectify the defects in some of them.  The principle is easy to understand.  If an Irish company is trading in 50 US states, it wants an assurance that it does not have to depend on every single state enacting into its law the protections set out in an agreement with the United States.  Having an investor dispute settlement system clearly has attractions for Irish companies which will be trading, for example, in the public procurement system and which might face obstacles that are unfair or discriminatory.<\/p> <p> The European Union has been very clear, as will be seen in the Canadian agreement, on when such agreements can be utilised.  They are very restricted.  There must be a denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings; a fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency in judicial administrative proceedings; manifest arbitrariness; targeted discrimination on manifestly wrong grounds such as gender, race or-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100027#Z00800","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453383300,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Minister has one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100029#BB00400","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1453383300,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Okay.

The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the principles of the TTIP.  However, there are certain caveats.  The successful conclusion of the EU-US free trade agreement, TTIP, depends on maintaining proper food standards and ensuring the jurisdiction of our courts will not be undermined.<\/p>  <p>  An agreement on the TTIP could boost the European economy by more than &euro;100 billion annually and create up to 10,000 extra jobs in Ireland.  As an exporting country, Ireland stands to benefit disproportionately from the potential for expanded market access, given that 49% of our non-EU exports are to the United States.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union and the United States are negotiating a trade and investment deal which would create the world&rsquo;s largest free trade area, but the many challenges faced and the increasing public opposition put the successful conclusion of an agreement in doubt.  In February 2013 EU and US leaders announced the start of procedures for negotiating an ambitious and comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership, following the final report of the EU-US high level working group.<\/p>  <p>  After a positive impact assessment by the European Commission, the Council approved the Commission&rsquo;s proposed mandate for negotiations in June 2013.  Talks, led by the European Commission and the US trade representative, started in July 2013; a fourth round was completed in March 2014 and a fifth is scheduled to be held between 19 and 23 May.  Observers are sceptical, however, about the 18 to 24 month timeframe to reach a deal.  Although negotiators are aiming for an agreement to be struck before the end of President Obama&rsquo;s mandate in 2016, officials are privately pessimistic as to the reality of that deadline.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will only support a TTIP deal which upholds fully food safety standards and the way the European Union sets them.  The European Union must ensure food standards would not be diminished in Europe by the agreement.  This country must raise its voice to defend our interests in agriculture and the agrifood sector in the negotiation of th deal.<\/p>  <p>  A number of key facts and figures for the agriculture industry are as follows: in 2015 Irish agrifood and drink exports increased by an estimated 3% to approximately &euro;10.8 billion.  The figures were prepared by Bord Bia in 2016.  The United Kingdom was the main destination for Irish agrifood and drink exports in 2015, accounting for 41% of all exports.  A total of 31% of exports went to continental EU markets, while the remaining 28% went to international markets.<\/p>  <p>  The latest estimates for the distribution of our agrifood and drink exports in 2015 by sector are as follows: dairy products and ingredients, 30%; prepared consumer foods, 17%; beef, 22%; live animals, 2%; beverages, 12%; pigmeat, 5%; poultry, 3%; sheepmeat, 2%; seafood, 5%, and edible horticulture and cereals, 2%.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 Ireland exported an estimated 524,000 tonnes of beef worth approximately &euro;2.19 billion.  In 2015, 178,000 cattle were exported live from Ireland worth approximately &euro;135 million.  The Irish sheep flock showed a rise of 1.3% and totalled 5.16 million head, with the breeding flock decreasing by approximately 1.1% to 2.56 million head according to the June 2015 livestock survey.<\/p>  <p>  During 2015 Ireland exported an estimated 47,000 tonnes of sheepmeat valued at approximately &euro;230 million.  In 2015 Ireland exported an estimated 230,000 tonnes of pigmeat worth an estimated &euro;570 million.  In 2015 the United Kingdom was the main market for Irish pigmeat, taking 40% of our total exports.  In 2014 total milk output was estimated at 6,161 million litres.  From this total milk output, 480 million litres was consumed as liquid milk.<\/p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>In addition, 166,000 tonnes of butter, 71,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder and 215,000 tonnes of cheese were produced in 2014.  In 2015 total dairy and ingredient exports increased by an estimated 4% to &euro;3.24 billion.  Quotes from Teagasc highlight the importance of agriculture to the economy and it needs to be protected and supported.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il will only support a TTIP deal which upholds fully food safety standards and the way the European Union sets them.  The Commission has stated current EU law on GMOs or hormone-treated beef will not change with the TTIP.  This is a pledge which the Union must be robust in enforcing.  Similarly, the chief EU negotiator has ruled out mutual recognition of chemicals between the European Union and the USA.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine reports that the agrifood sector in Ireland contributes &euro;24 billion to the national economy, generating 6.3% of gross value added and almost 10% of Ireland&rsquo;s exports, and provides 7.7% of national employment.  It is one of Ireland's most important indigenous manufacturing sectors.  According to the Teagasc website, it includes food and drink firms throughout the country that export 85% of our food and seafood to more than 160 countries worldwide.  <br\/><br\/>The TTIP's expected benefits include its stated aim of expanding trade and investment across the Atlantic, increasing employment and competitiveness and enabling a common approach to rules for global trade which third countries could also adopt.  Another goal is strengthening overall EU-US relations. The EU-US trade and investment relationship is considered the largest and most important in the world.  The two economies account for nearly half of global gross domestic product and 30% of world trade, with US and EU trade flows in goods totalling &euro;497 billion and in services totalling &euro;315 billion.  The level of foreign direct investment is even greater, with total FDI stocks of &euro;3.2 trillion in each other&rsquo;s economies.  The transatlantic economy sustains about 15 million jobs, which illustrates the importance of the potential agreement.  Nevertheless, the TTIP&rsquo;s proponents claim there is untapped potential in the relationship.  The European Union argues that significant gains would arise from further liberalising transatlantic trade.  An EU commissioned study asserts that a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP would bring overall annual GDP gains of 0.5% for the European Union and 0.4% for the United States once fully implemented in 2027.  That amounts to an extra &euro;545 per household in the Europeand Union per year. <br\/><br\/>Reducing non-tariff barriers and further liberalising services and public procurement would constitute around 80% of the benefits.  The TTIP would positively affect global GDP by a figure of &euro;100 billion and labour markets.  Other studies also point to major benefits for income levels and job creation in the European Union and the United States but also in those countries which stand to lose from the TTIP.  The TTIP would also create opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, mainly through trade facilitation.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il wants to ensure the new opportunities to be created by TTIP would not just accrue to large companies.  Such opportunities are especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden small firms which have fewer resources to overcome them than their larger counterparts.  It is welcome that there would be a dedicated chapter on SME issues within a TTIP agreement. <br\/><br\/>The negotiations cover market access, comprising the elimination of tariffs on goods and new access to services and public procurement; regulatory convergence and NTBs; and rules for global trade.  The negotiators are discussing how to ensure the compatibility of existing and future regulations to reduce unnecessary costs and red tape, while achieving the levels of health, safety and environmental protection each side deems to be appropriate.  In particular, five aspects are highlighted.  They are sanitary and phytosanitary issues, including food safety, animal and health regulations; technical barriers to trade - technical regulations, conformity assessment and standards; specific sectors of goods and services, for example, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, automobiles and chemicals; cross-cutting disciplines and transparency; and a framework for future regulatory co-operation.<br\/><br\/>The United States stresses horizontal and transparency issues, while the European Union is prioritising the sector-specific pillar.  Moreover, a US proposal to allow business more input earlier in EU rule-making, implying significant unreciprocated changes to the EU regulatory system, is opposed by the European Union and European business. <br\/><br\/>Another difficult topic is agriculture.  The United States denounces EU policies and measures on genetically modified organisms, hormone-treated beef, pork fed with ractopamine and chlorine washed poultry as unjustified scientifically and a barrier to US exports.  Therefore, the United States is seeking to eliminate EU SPS barriers to US meat exports.  Clearly, it will be one of the most significant debating points in negotiating the agreement.  The standards we apply here should be upheld.  We owe it to the population of the European Union and I hope the US negotiators will recognise its importance.  <br\/><br\/>US industry has been very vocal on the issues mentioned in criticising the European Union's approach and its refusal to open up such issues for discussion.  The new US ambassador to the European Union has stated the European Food Safety Authority agreed with the belief of the United States that GM foods were safe and that the United States wanted the European Union to listen to its own scientific advice.<br\/><br\/>The TTIP is intended to set rules on investment protection, trade facilitation, intellectual property rights, labour and the environment and energy and raw materials which may eventually set global standards.  Of these, the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions seems to be the most contentious.  In the face of growing opposition, the European Union adapted its position and announced the suspension of the ISDS talks pending a three-month public consultation process on the issue from March 2014.  Fianna Fail shares the concerns of citizens about the controversial investor-state dispute settlement mechanism and the ability of powerful companies to sue foreign governments.  It is concerned about the abuse of investor protection provisions and the lack of transparency surrounding arbitration processes.  We welcome the recent European Commission proposal to lead the way in reforming the global investment regime into a public investment court system which will operate like traditional courts. <br\/><br\/>One of the crucial issues in the United States regarding trade negotiations is trade promotion authority, or fast track, which allows the President to put a negotiated document before Congress to approve it without it being able to make amendments.  Trade promotion authority needs to be granted to the President by Congress.  A Bill to do this has been introduced, but the White House is facing a lot of opposition, not least from Democratic Senators.  The Commission has stated trade promotion authority will in the end be essential in concluding a deal, but as the negotiations are nowhere near a conclusion, the issue is not crucial at this time.<br\/><br\/>Another important aspect in the United States is the independence of regulatory agencies.  This is important in the negotiations because it means that agencies such as the US Food and Drug Agency will have to be closely involved in them as they play an important role in creating rules, regulations and procedures.  Relations between the federal and state governments will also play a part, especially in opening up public procurement markets at state level to EU companies.<br\/><br\/>We are of the strong belief the TTIP agreement should not lead to lower levels of consumer, environmental, social and labour protection that those offered in the European Union.  We welcome and fully support the firm commitment of the European Commission and the other 27 member states that EU standards are not up for negotiation.  Ireland must work with its European partners to ensure this commitment will be upheld.  We will only support a TTIP deal which upholds fully food safety standards and the way the European Union set sets them.

According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, 120,000 jobs have been created in the State since 2011, not 135,000.  In addition, during that time, the number of people in activation schemes has risen from 50,000 to 80,000 and, therefore, it is reasonable to believe a good part of the aforementioned 120,000 jobs are activation places.  This would bring the number of jobs created in the State down to 90,000.  It also is important to contrast it with the fact that 147,000 people net have emigrated and that 105,000 are underemployed, that is, work for a few hours per week and seek full-time jobs.  In total, the broad group of people who have been affected by Government economic policy is approximately 600,000 in number, which constitutes one quarter of the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  Trade can be good and can be a way to ensure that people come out of poverty.  It can mean that wealth and prosperity spread throughout the country and society and around the globe.  It also means citizens can reach their full potential, either through work or through the propagation of new technologies and innovations.  However, trade is amoral and it can be used in negative or positive ways.  If it is structured unfairly, it can accentuate the imbalances in society.  It can decrease safeguards in areas such as workers' rights, food quality and people's health and safety.  Trade also can alter the political and economic landscapes of a country and can be used as a weapon of war.  Consequently, as a liberal democracy, it is important to seek to construct the trade infrastructure of the planet in a fair manner.  Oxfam's research has indicated this is a time of extreme inequality in which 62 people have the same level of wealth as 50% of the people on the planet.  That is an incredible figure.  Moreover, the wealthiest 1% of people now are as wealthy as the other 99% of the population.  This situation is shocking and is progressively worsening.  This is not just the typical left-right debate that happens with regard to poor and wealthy people in the State.  This is the most radical over-concentration of wealth in the hands of a small group of people and no matter on what side of the Chamber one sits, there is a real need to focus on and eradicate that problem.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than eradicating that problem, my worry is that agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, accentuate the problem even further.  This concentration of wealth in the hands of a few is not happening by accident.  It is happening on the basis of the rules of society and the trade rules.  TTIP is the biggest negotiation on the largest trade agreement in the history of the planet and the level of opposition to it that has arisen recently is phenomenal, as more and more countries such as France, Germany, etc., realise that both their interests and those of their citizens are in trouble.  It also is worth noting the entire process has been shrouded in secrecy.  Corporate bodies have been given unfettered access to the European Commission.  I believe 600 meetings behind closed doors have been held between the Commission and different lobby groups, 88% of the latter being large businesses.  It is incredible that my MEP, who is responsible to me, can go into a secure reading room and read tracts from the negotiations.  However, were I to ask the MEP what is the content of such reading, that MEP would be prohibited from giving me the full information.  Consequently, the process by which TTIP is being negotiated is the antithesis of open and transparent democracy.<\/p>  <p>  As for the projected benefits and so on of TTIP to society, the Copenhagen Economics report outlines the one-off increases in GDP levels at approximately 1.1%.  It states, without providing proper evidence, that there could be between 5,000 and 10,000 additional jobs here.  It is interesting because the Minister opened his remarks by noting Ireland currently is extremely successful in exploiting the opportunities available in the Atlantic trade corridor.  That possibly is an argument against making such a radical change as is contemplated in this regard.  In any event, 5,000 jobs amounts to 0.5% of total employment here and the Centre for Economic Policy Research, CEPR, study reckons that over the period of time, families would benefit by &euro;545 on foot of full liberalisation by 2027 - in other words, an extremely small amount of money over that time.  In an important point for this country, which is overexposed in respect of the level of its exports emanating from the foreign direct investment sector, the Copenhagen Economics report indicated that sector will overly benefit from any changes on foot of TTIP.  Six out of eight sectors in which exports come from indigenous Irish organisations are likely to see a fall in exports as a result of TTIP.  The report projects that under TTIP, economy-wide growth attributed to foreign firms will be ten times that of Irish firms and this will continue the damaging trend that already is happening in society.<\/p>  <p>  There is so much to talk about and so little time in which to so do but the dangers of the inclusion within TTIP of the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism cannot be overstated.  It represents a horrendous ceding of sovereignty and power not merely to a another political state or to a Union but to multinational corporations.  For the first time, we are stating we do not believe our courts system is an adequate space in which disputes between citizens and corporations can be dealt with.  If this is the case, we must make the necessary reforms to make the courts fit for purpose; not cede that power to an organisation that has no democratic responsibility back to us.  I have no doubt but that this entire process, regardless of whether it is used to a significant extent, will have a chilling effect on nations' parliaments with regard to the policy decisions they make.  All Members will have heard of the cases pertaining to Egypt, whereby the authorities there rowed back on changes to minimum wages, etc., due to the perceived threat of the investor-state dispute mechanism.  It is interesting that the Minister today accepts some possible reforms may have taken place with regard to the aforementioned dispute mechanism.  However, before those reforms were written, the Minister signed a letter encouraging the European Commission to commit to this process.  The Minister had played his cards before the negotiation there had even happened.  Members also will have noted the problems with big tobacco companies using this process around the world and the effect this can have on governments.  Therefore, it is unbelievable that the Minister was party to a letter written to the European Commission pleading for the inclusion of a investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  European citizens have the right to be part of a democratic process and to have a parliament and jurisprudence over which they have oversight and this proposal reduces such oversight in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  There is another major problem, whereby the Government refers to the reduction of non-tariff barriers.  There are different types of non-tariff barriers and standards form a significant element of such barriers.  Recently, the European Commission ditched any efforts to strengthen its rules on pesticides, the logic being that the Commission came under pressure from US officials because differences in standards would be perceived as being a non-tariff barrier.  Even if the mechanics of the TTIP process are not directly related to downward pressure on those regulations, for the US and the EU to get rid of non-tariff barriers fully, the two parties will be obliged to reach a common denominator.<\/p><p>The fact of the matter is that the common denominator is likely to be lower than the standards in this country.  This affects areas including the environment, workers' rights, the quality of foodstuffs and the testing done on products.  Take, for example, Volkswagen.  Even with two standards systems in two jurisdictions, it took the US to identify that Volkswagen was cheating when it came to the levels of emissions from its cars.  The whole process will be reduced to a lowest common denominator and, as a result, the citizen will suffer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100031#DD00200","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453385100,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The more I read about and listen to the discussion on TTIP and ISDS, the more the word that looms large for me is \"why\".  The Proclamation of Poblacht na h&Eacute;ireann declared, \"the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible\".  I do not think any of us here would argue with that declaration.  If we accept that is the way it should be, why would the Government of an independent, democratic, sovereign republic willingly cede the power to determine and implement policy to anyone that is representative of the interests of international big business, profiteers and shareholders?<\/p>  <p>  What threats, inducements or promises were made to somehow convince the Government and other European governments that TTIP and ISDS, with the consequential loss of sovereignty, could be viewed in any way as a good deal?  Does a trade agreement have to contain trade provisions that provide that the ability of a democratically-elected Government to determine and implement policy can be usurped by big business?  It is clear a trade agreement does not have to contain those provisions and it is equally clear that it should not contain such provisions.  Despite the chorus of voices supporting it in this Parliament and others, TTIP and ISDS is not in the interest of the people of this republic.  <\/p>  <p>  A central tenet of TTIP is the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS.  Under ISDS, a company is able to sue a state if a government introduces legislation which the company feels might be damaging to its business interests.  Companies are able to bypass the national court system and go directly to the international, investor-based, tribunals.  It is not just conspiracy theorists who are talking and writing about it.  A moratorium on fracking was introduced in Quebec in 2012.  Due to an ISDS arrangement which is part of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada is now being sued for 250 million Canadian dollars for loss of potential profit.  Approximately 63% of ISDS cases which have been brought against Canada have been due to environmental protections Canada introduced and which the companies feel have been hurting their profits or potential profits.  The use of this tactic is to force democratic governments to comply with the will of multinational business and thereby thwart the democratic process.  This is the reason I ask why.  If any proof were needed that we should stop the fundamentally flawed and compromised EPA study into fracking and ban fracking for ever, Canada is it.  Think of the 250 million Canadian dollars, stop and study and then stop fracking forever in this country.  <\/p>  <p>  The beef industry supports more than 100,000 family farms.  Any changes to it will certainly have an impact, and in my view an adverse one, on the agrifood industry in this country.  We have meat from clean, grass-fed animals in this country and we are known throughout the world for it.  Within TTIP and ISDS, a steer reared on a farm in Montana and fed artificial food will be as valuable as a grass-fed cow in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  As a democratic institution, we have a solemn responsibility to ensure the democratic process is upheld.  As the inheritors of the men and women of 1916, we must demand that the will of the people is to the foremost of all decisions made in this country and not the will of some backroom investors who are keen to walk all over the democratic process of this country and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100032#EE00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1453385100,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I regret there is so little time available for this debate.  As the Whip for the Technical Group, I have been raising it at the Whips' meeting for more than six months.  During the last throes of this Government and D&aacute;il, we are being allowed a tiny amount of time to talk about this significant issue.  The Social Democrats and I accept that as small, open economy Ireland is required to trade with the rest of the world and we require trade agreements.  However, that we are opposed to TTIP does not mean we are opposed to trade.<\/p>  <p>  There are three primary reasons for our opposition.  First, what has happened to date has been cloaked in far too much secrecy.  There has been a lack of transparency.  One needs to question why.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the investor state dispute settlement process is a key issue and of major concern.  It is the most controversial element in TTIP's design.  All trade agreements contain dispute resolution mechanisms.  However, TTIP will contain an ISDS process that will hand inordinate power to large corporations to interfere with the democratic right of state parties to adopt policies contrary to the commercial interests or potential commercial interest of such corporations.  The ISDS process will allow corporations to legally challenge governments of state parties and prevent the adoption of certain policies.  While the Commission says that forcing policy change is not possible through the ISDS, it will be possible for the panel of international arbitrators to require a state party to pay compensation to a company where it finds that the company was treated unfairly by the Government.  However, the definition of \"unfair\" is unclear.  Many multinationals have turnovers comparable to the GDP of a small European nation.  I include ourselves in that.  It is not clear what levels of compensation may be awarded.  This is a serious transfer of power and we have major concerns about it.<\/p>  <p>  The third point I wish to highlight concerns regulatory co-ordination.  This includes, for example, food standards and employment rights.  There is a major concern in this regard.  Many environmentalists are concerned that challenges could be brought against, for example, domestic energy policy.  A large automobile company could challenge the decision of the Commission to require cleaner emission standards.  An American nuclear power investor may challenge a decision by a state to pay a party to phase out nuclear power and get compensation.  This is just an example.<\/p>  <p>  Those are the three primary reasons for our opposition.  We completely accept that trade agreements are necessary but it is what is contained in TTIP that makes it most objectionable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100032#EE00300","speaker":"1202"},{"type":"speech","time":1453385700,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I have raised TTIP with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on many occasions: he has probably got tired listening to me.  I have been highlighting my fears about the negative impacts it could have, while he has been concentrating on the jobs and growth that are supposed to spin out of it.  To support his claims, the Minister repeatedly cites the now discredited research by the Centre for Economic Policy Research on behalf of the European Commission, and a study by Copenhagen Economics commissioned by the Minister's Department.  Both these studies use the same economic modelling framework, the general equilibrium model, which even first year economics students learn is pretty useless for assessing reality, although it is very suitable for neoliberal policy makers.  It works on the ridiculous assumption that the market is self-correcting, although we know it is not.  The model assumes a fixed labour supply and perfect labour mobility.  It assesses regulations which protect workers' health, food quality and the environment as \"costs\", while the removal of costs is calculated as economic gain.  Basically, it is neoliberal, free-marketeering corporate welfare, yet the Government keeps telling us everything is great.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's Department has promised that regulatory co-operation will not lead to a watering down of protections for the environment, public services, public health or privacy.  However, the fact is that since regulatory co-operation between the US and the EU began in earnest in 1998, it has been responsible for steadily lowering our protections and standards.  I will give a few examples which have recently been highlighted by Corporate Europe Observatory.<\/p>  <p>  Privacy has been attacked by regulatory co-operation.  The European Court of Justice recently struck down the safe harbour agreement, which was concocted under regulatory co-operation.  The court argued that the agreement did not safeguard citizens' right to data privacy and God knows, given the revelations by Snowden last year, including the fact that just about every phone call in Ireland can be recorded thanks to tapping into the fibre-optic cable in the sea just off Wales, we have plenty of reasons to be concerned about citizens' data protection.<\/p>  <p>  Another aspect is financial regulation.  In 2004, for example, US financial institutions managed to secure an agreement that would allow them to operate in the EU while being monitored by US supervisory authorities.  One of the end results was that, when the financial crisis reached its peak in Europe in 2008, it was revealed that neither US nor EU financial authorities had any idea what assets the US insurance giant AIG had on its books.  The collapse of this co-operation marked a key drama in the crisis and led to a bailout of $186 billion.  These guys can fail as there is always a State there to pick up the tab for them.<\/p>  <p>  On environmental protections, a proposal on electro-scrap chemical waste was watered down in 2002.  The precautionary principle was sidelined in the process, as the final version made it impossible for member states to adopt a ban, even when a substance is deemed dangerous.  A proposal to move faster on ozone-depleting substances was struck down in 2000.  The EU&rsquo;s 2013 proposal that airlines should pay for emissions was immediately attacked and effectively stopped by the US through the regulatory co-operation mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  What is really scary is that all these attacks on protections happened when regulatory co-operation was based on voluntary rules.  The TTIP will change all that and lock us into a disastrous situation in which the unspoken motto of neoliberalism, \"profit before people\", will become law.  There is no doubt that neoliberalism suits fine for the present Government and it suited fine for Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party before it.  It has been the driving philosophy for some time and gives the people plenty to worry about for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100033#FF00100","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1453385700,"counter":338,"content":"<p>What we have here is a massive transfer of powers and an erosion of democratic rights.  This charade in the Chamber today is nothing more than a sop and a pretence that our Parliament is discussing the matter.  I find it quite insulting.<\/p><p>As George Monbiot has put it, where once trade agreements promoted free trade by removing trade tariffs, &quot;now they promote the interests of transnational capital by downgrading the defence of human health, the natural world, labour rights and the poor and vulnerable from predatory corporate practices.&quot;  This is the neoliberal project unleashed, the endgame of that project, whereby there has been a chipping away at many of the rights that people came to expect.  The damage is found in polluted rivers and seas; overheating economies; temporary, low-paid jobs; air pollution; and the transfer of wealth from the majority into the hands of a very small and shrinking minority.  With this deal on the table, the social democratic facade of the EU is being finally dismantled.<\/p><p>The Government and other international leaders have said to those of us who have raised objections not to be worrying about it, and have told us it is not going to be as bad as we all think.  However, with other agreements like the trans-Pacific partnership, TPP, and so on, we heard exactly the same thing and, once the details were published, they were actually worse than what people had thought.  We have been given a variety of assurances about investor-state dispute settlement, renamed the investment court system, which renaming is just cosmetics really.  We have been given assurances about public services, genetically modified organisms, GMOs, and food standards but it is very difficult to take those assurances at face value given what has happened with TPP and other agreements.<\/p><p>A fundamental problem here is that there are a lot of reassurances that turn out to be utterly worthless.  For example, last May, talking about the TPP, Barack Obama said:<\/p><blockquote>critics warn that parts of this deal would undermine American regulation - food safety, worker safety, even financial regulations.  They're making this stuff up.  This is just not true.  No trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws.<\/blockquote><p>He was of course utterly wrong; when the text of the TPP was published it emerged that many of the commitments they were talking about had been stood on their heads.<\/p><p>The Minister told the Oireachtas jobs committee back in May that everything was going to be grand, we should not be worried and that the negotiations were utterly transparent.  That is not true; they have not been transparent.  While we have had sight of the Commission's position papers and negotiating texts, we have not seen the US side.  We certainly have not had full and free public access to the draft of the agreement.  MEPs are able to get access to a draft text only in confidential reading rooms where the texts are stored, and even if they do go to the bother of looking at them they cannot tell the public what they have actually seen or take notes beyond what they can scribble down with a pen and paper when they go in.  Is that transparency and accountability?  If everything is so great with the deal, why is it shrouded in secrecy?  The only conclusion one can reach is that everything is not so great with it.  We can base that on what has happened in other trade agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100033#FF00200","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1453385700,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Finally we have a debate - two and a half hours on what is the most serious attack on the environmental, labour, consumer and democratic rights of almost 1 billion people.  That is how seriously the Government takes it.  In reality, among all of the governments in the European Union, the Government is one of the biggest fans of TTIP and all its most odious parts.<\/p>  <p>  TTIP is a charter for corporate rights.  It very consciously places the right of big corporations to profit above the rights of ordinary people to decent wages, a safe environment and proper consumer rights.  It gives the corporations the right to sue governments that interfere with their right to profit and also gives them special access to the writing of regulations so they are written in the corporations' interests.<\/p>  <p>  There is free trade between the EU and the US.  The average tariff for US imports into the EU is 3.5%, while the other way around it is 5%.  This is not about free trade; 80% of the so-called estimated benefits of the agreement come from what are called \"non-tariff barriers\".  Non-tariff barriers are those things that the rest of us would call environmental legislation, labour legislation, health, consumer and financial regulations.  This is a race to the bottom of the Atlantic in all of those regulations in the interests of major corporations.  These are not negotiations between the representatives of ordinary people in the EU and in the US.  As John Hilary said, TTIP is correctly understood not as a negotiation between two competing trading partners but as an assault on European and US societies by transnational corporations seeking to remove regulatory barriers to their activities on both sides of the Atlantic.  The big corporations are dominating the meetings with the Commission.  Some 90% of the meetings the Commission is having with so-called stakeholders are with representatives of the big corporations.<\/p><p>The way they will do it is precisely through the ISDS mechanism.  We can rename it whatever we like but, in reality, what this means it is a right to sue any government that interferes with the right to profit, where expropriation is defined extremely broadly and includes measures tantamount to expropriation, indirect expropriation and regulatory expropriation.  If a country does anything that interferes with their right to maximise profit, they can sue, as they have been doing under existing agreements in a whole range of highly controversial cases.<\/p> <p> The other point I want to highlight, because it is sometimes lost in all of the justified focus on ISDS, is the question of regulatory co-operation.  This is the back door by which they will agree GMOs, chlorine washed chickens and hormone fed beef.  They will not sign up for it in the first instance but it is a living agreement.  They set up a regulatory co-operation council, which is populated by so-called experts who are representatives of the big corporations and, from then on, they get a first say in the writing of laws.  It is giving corporations the right to write laws on things that affect the rest of us.  This must be a key issue in the election.  People should not vote for any political party that refuses to take a clear stand against TTIP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100033#FF00300","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453386300,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Surprisingly, I find myself in agreement with much of what the Sinn F&eacute;in speakers had to say.  I am not that surprised to find myself in agreement with Deputy Michael Colreavy, who is somebody I have worked closely with in the agriculture committee.  I understand he is not seeking re-election and I want to pay tribute to him and his very positive contribution in the House and, in particular, at committees, where he has been a very reasonable and reasoned voice, although having been a reasonable and reasoned voice has not in any way diluted what he had to say or the strength with which he argued it.  He is a colleague with whom it has been a pleasure to work over the past five years.  Perhaps it is simply because we are both representatives of rural Ireland in the area west of the Shannon that he is somebody with whom I personally found a lot of common ground.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the specific debate on TTIP, the Minister opened the debate by talking about the benefits of the European Union and he stated that certain parties were against Ireland's entry to it.  He is right.  My own party, the Labour Party, campaigned against Ireland's entry to the European Union.  With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps it was wrong, or at least it was wrong for a period of time because, of course, the EU was more than a mere trade agreement or trading body.  That remained the case for at least a period of time, when it enjoyed a greater degree of legitimacy than it does now.<\/p>  <p>  States derive their legitimacy from the democratic mandate of those who govern them but also from vindicating the rights of their citizens.  While there is a democratic deficit at the heart of the EU, it has also been very much about vindicating the rights of its citizens.  The social democratic movement in Europe, along with the broader European left, would have very much favoured the social Europe which evolved and which is now, unfortunately, in retreat, given the make-up of the current Commission and of the previous Commission under President Barroso.  That social Europe which was brought about was certainly something I would have favoured and it was also favoured by the majority of citizens in Ireland who would see the benefits of the EU, by citizens across Europe and by all those on the left who consider themselves to be internationalists.  While I am sure we could have a big argument in this House about who is on the left and who is not, I believe most of us - I say \"us\" - would see ourselves as internationalists but also as being in favour of a social Europe and of social protection.<\/p>  <p>  It is for that reason I would have concerns about TTIP and what exactly is proposed.  I would not accept that the Commission as it currently stands is about protecting small states, nor is it about protecting a social Europe.  It has been very much influenced by the mantra of big business.  I appreciate this is one of the issues that would most highlight the differences between the parties in Government.  For example, the Minister is clearly very much in favour of what TTIP can potentially do whereas I have a lot more concern about it.  While I am not sure if all those in my party have concerns, I dare say a majority would have.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is a great believer in trade.  He believes corporations are essential and that we need to do everything possible to attract corporations and not hinder them in any way.  I disagree with that.  I also disagree with the effect the large multinationals are having in rural Ireland, with Tesco vans driving out with deliveries and the fact that multinationals are selling below-cost alcohol and below-cost foodstuffs that are produced in Ireland.  From my time on the environment committee, I know members of the Minister's party also have grave concerns about below-cost selling of food and the lack of transparency in the food chain.  Legislation was introduced which could have been utilised to bring about greater transparency and a ban on below-cost selling of Irish agricultural produce, but that was not utilised.  I appreciate there are ideological reasons for that and while I respect the ideology the Minister holds, I do not agree with it.  I do not think it brings about a better or fairer society and I do not think it is in line with what is beneficial for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Colreavy spoke about the Irish people being sovereign.  Of course, we pool our sovereignty within the EU but we do not pool our right to govern or to introduce laws and regulations with people who represent only market interests, and who do not represent citizens and their broader interests, such as the right to health, to earn a decent living and to engage in work, all of which are fundamental to our Republic and to the social Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The example of Australia being sued under an investment protection treaty for introducing plain labelling on tobacco has been mentioned in the House.  This is of concern to me because it is one of the advances this Government has made under the Fine Gael deputy leader, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, who came out very strongly in favour of plain packaging and a greater unanimity in advertising for tobacco products.  If we continue down that road, will we in Ireland be sued?  If we introduced an order on minimum pricing for alcohol, will we be sued by market interests?  I believe most would agree the consumption of alcohol is widely accepted as a social activity in Ireland, but not the below-cost selling of alcohol, which results in binge drinking and in a greater burden for our health care system.  It also means people are being pushed by market forces into drinking more at home and spending their money on what is produced by multinationals, in a context where many of the alcohol companies and the big multinationals are not Irish.  As a result, the profits leave Ireland.  Is it on that basis and that basis alone that the sale of alcohol is to be regulated?  I do not think so.<\/p>  <p>  I am a farmer and come from a constituency where agriculture is hugely important, as is tourism.  There are huge concerns in this regard.  Irish farmers produce a very high quality agricultural product.  Again, I refer to Deputy Colreavy, who mentioned that we have grass-finished beef.  Grass-finished beef is a very different product even when compared to some of the beef that comes from the Minister's area, where cattle are fed rations in feeding houses.  There is a problem with the greater control that beef barons like Larry Goodman exert on that because they control more and more feeding houses.  As smaller farmers go under, they are forced to take a contract to feed Larry Goodman's cattle, and he then has a huge number of cattle.  Therefore, when the prices start to rise for the ordinary producer who produces a very high quality product, whether in Kerry, Leitrim, east Clare or west Clare, the beef barons can flood the market and drive the price down again.  The bottom line is that all beef produced in Ireland is hormone free and almost all cattle range naturally in the wild.<\/p><p>They see the sky over them and grass under them and do not live their lives with concrete under their feet, as do cattle in other countries.  They are not fed hormones or genetically modified food.  Is all of this to be jeopardised for investors?  These are legitimate concerns.<\/p> <p> The issue of tourism is also hugely important.  It is impossible to conceive of fracking in Ireland.  Of course, it would not be economically feasible now with the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia driving down international oil prices.  However, if and when oil prices start to rise again, as they will, people will start to talk about fracking again.  I believe it is impossible to conceive of fracking in west Clare where the landscape is a tourism product.  Will those that invest in fracking and the technology involved be able to sue Ireland if it chooses not to allow fracking?  That would be a preposterous invasion of our sovereignty, one that I would not accept.  We have seen the watering down of the 2009 fuel quality directive, which was meant to ensure that fuel is only extracted from relatively clean sources.  However, the fuel derived from the tar sands of Canada was allowed to be introduced into Europe on the basis of free trade and investor protection.<\/p> <p> These issues need to be balanced, but they can only be balanced if a treaty is discussed openly, rather than in the closed manner referred to, between democratically elected and accountable representatives.  The issues should not be left to representatives who are only accountable to big business and shareholders.  That is not the world I want to live in and is certainly not something I am prepared to countenance or accept, even in the name of free trade, because the legitimacy of the European Union was not just based around free trade, but around the protection and the vindication of the rights of every citizen right across Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100034#GG00200","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453386900,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin Ferris is sharing time with Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100035#HH00200","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1453386900,"counter":344,"content":"<p>It is hard, in such a short time, to express all the concerns I have about TTIP.  For a start, the fact that the negotiations are being held in such secrecy creates an uneasy atmosphere about the agreement that will finally emerge.  There are threats to workers' rights, to our food safety standards, to agriculture and to our very sovereignty, in the sense that investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, seems to bestow more power on corporations than sovereign governments.  We have seen some stark examples of this, for example when Veolia, a company that is also very active in Ireland, threatened to sue the city of Alexandria because the Egyptian government wanted to increase the minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  However, because I have limited time, I will focus on agriculture, related matters and my concerns about TTIP in that area.  The Irish beef industry is export-led and needs to be so to survive.  The entry into the EU market of beef from the United States of America can only do damage to the Single Market.  The American product is produced to standards far less strict than the European ones and the presence of hormones in the meat is a major factor.  Beef from the US will be cheaper than the European product.  This introduces unfair competition, which can only lead to a lowering of standards in the Union or damage to the market for home produced meat.  The reputation of Irish meat is second to none and this must remain the case.<\/p>  <p>  Consumer confidence is key to maintaining our market for Irish agricultural produce and any dilution of that is a serious threat to the industry, which is already threatened by lower prices, higher production costs and manipulation of the market by the big operators within it who have no regard for the maintenance of the family farm and the people whose lives depend on Irish agriculture.  Ireland is a small country, but where a meat processing cartel is in existence, it is able to manipulate the market, control prices to suit its agenda, have access to beef and cattle data and maintain feeder lots so as to ensure it can manipulate prices.  The magic number in this regard is 30,000 animals a week.  Effectively, if farmers or a farming organisation decide to hold back cattle in order to obtain higher prices, the cartel can supply cattle from its feeder lots to maintain the market in its own interest.  It is predicted that our beef sector will contract by something between 1% and 3%, the equivalent of from &euro;25 million to &euro;45 million, as a result of TTIP.<\/p>  <p>  We are also concerned at the threat that genetically modified organisms will be a more common phenomenon.  The opening of the EU market to food produce from the United States, where approximately 70% of all processed foods sold in supermarkets contains genetically modified ingredients, must have an effect and it seems that our own cautious approach to GMOs will be cast aside in the face of this deal.  EU plans to regulate hormone-damaging chemicals found in pesticides were dropped recently and there is concern that this too is a TTIP issue.  Food production in the European Union follows a preventative approach, ensuring high levels of hygiene at all stages of food production from farm to fork.  These standards must be maintained and demanded of any food coming into the EU market.<\/p>  <p>  Irish farmers must adhere to strict criteria.  From the moment a calf is born we have traceability.  We also have significant safety standards in regard to the eradication of any diseases.  In the United States, most cattle are treated with antibiotics for any type of ailment or are fed antibiotics to prevent illness.  They are also fed with GM produce.  These cattle then make their way into the market, often with stark consequences.  The standards we have must be maintained and demanded of any food coming onto the EU market.  We want to maintain these standards.<\/p>  <p>  We pride ourselves on the traceability of our produce.  Our consumers like to know where their food is coming from, but can we guarantee that with US produce?  I do not believe so.  The same goes for milk and other dairy produce.  The point must be made that the so-called opening of the US market to Irish beef has not materialised in the massive sales we were promised.  Early last year it was stated this market would be worth in excess of &euro;50 million a year, but in response to a priority question this morning, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, informed us this market was only worth &euro;11 million last year.  Therefore, the prediction was totally wrong.<\/p>  <p>  If our export trade is offset by our own market in Europe being flooded by beef or dairy produce produced cheaply to standards far lower than ours, we are in big trouble.  How do we know, when the Government is not telling us, that the interests of Irish agrifood manufacturing are being protected during these negotiations?  Does the Government even know what is being negotiated on our behalf?  I doubt it.  Are these negotiations being rural proofed on our behalf?  The big question around the whole issue of TTIP is in whose interests is this deal.  That is a question to which we have not had a satisfactory answer.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and five other committees were to debate this issue, but just three committees did so.  The agriculture committee raised questions regarding the motivation behind TTIP, who benefits from it and the ulterior motive behind it.  Given the tremendous record of beef, dairy and food produce in general within the European Union, its standards are second to none.  These standards serve us well from the point of view of our agricultural export programme.  We need to protect this position, not just for economic gain, but for our citizens so that they can be safe and be assured the produce they buy, cook and eat is of the same standard as we are compelled to produce.<\/p>  <p>  These questions need to be asked.  The Minister must take on board everything that has been said, not least what has been said by Labour Party Deputies, who for once have been inclined to agree with us.  I hope he takes that on board also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100035#HH00300","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1453386900,"counter":345,"content":"<p>As there is just a short time left in this slot, does Deputy Crowe wish to take that time or speak later?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100035#HH00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1453386900,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Can I have five minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100035#HH00500","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1453387500,"counter":347,"content":"<p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>We can give the Deputy extra time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100036#JJ00100","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1453387500,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The debate follows an attempt to have a cross-party committee motion on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  I was one of the first to raise this at committee meetings, as I had concerns about it.  It seems bizarre that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, of which I am a member, has never discussed TTIP.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform did not examine its impact on public procurement, financial services and customs, which again seems odd.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality could not investigate or report on the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism or data protection.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications decided not to examine how TTIP could affect regulations around fracking.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about a report that is approximately ten pages long, which is not very long.  It pales in comparison with some other European countries, which have produced much more detailed reports.  They have as many concerns as we do about where this leading.  TTIP is unprecedented in its scale and depth and the Oireachtas report should have outlined the positive and negative aspects of the trade agreement, as raised by Oireachtas Members of all parties and none.  Sadly, the report does not achieve that.<\/p>  <p>  Colleagues have already referred to a number of issues and I will reflect on the comments of other speakers relating to the ISDS mechanism.  That will allow companies to bypass national court systems and go directly to international investor-based tribunals and sue governments if they introduce new rules or laws after corporations make an investment in that country.  This process completely undermines state sovereignty and democratic decision-making.  Some examples were given during the debate but companies in the resource extraction industry could sue governments that implement more environmentally friendly policies.  That certainly raises some concerns.  For example, Lone Pine Resources Canada is suing the Canadian Government for $250 million after the Quebec Government introduced a moratorium that would ban fracking.  That is being done under the same ISDS mechanism in the North American Free Trade Agreement.  The TransCanada Corporation is suing the US Government for $15 billion because it cancelled plans to build the environmentally disastrous Keystone pipeline that would have affected very sensitive areas.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of being worried about this bypassing of the national courts, one Fine Gael MEP, Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, suggested that the ISDS tribunal could be located in Ireland.  He clearly does not have a problem with the nature of these tribunals.  The big question we all should ask is, what is wrong with our courts?  Why do we need these tribunals?  The argument is that the law would be undermined but I thought we are fairly well regulated in Europe.  There is no shortage of laws or regulations in Ireland, although many of us argue that there is a need to improve them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister would even assert that the mechanism that allows private corporations to sue national governments for potential loss of revenue or profits will not interfere with the right of governments to regulate.  The European Commission has had to back-track on its original ISDS plans because of the outcry of many European citizens but re-labelled ISDS plans will not fool anybody.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague in Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr. Matt Carthy, MEP, commissioned a formal legal opinion into the constitutionality of the European investment court proposed by the European Commission and we expect that it will confirm that an Irish referendum will be required as the new court would not engage with the national court and it would limit the ability of an Irish Government to legislate freely.  Nevertheless, the Government continues to champion this anti-democratic move, although it is not saying why.  It is worrying that it has no concerns about the compatibility of this court system with the Constitution.  I hope there will be a referendum, as it would be the only appropriate democratic process for citizens' engagement.  Sinn F&eacute;in, along with other parties and individuals in the House and millions of citizens right across the European Union, would welcome such a referendum.<\/p>  <p>  There are serious concerns relating to TTIP, as it was not properly examined or debated by a number of committees.  I attended meetings of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and there was serious engagement and as we tried to get different views.  However, it is like all these things in that trade is good and we cannot say anything about it because it will bring about more jobs, etc.  It will also mean deregulation and major changes as workers may potentially lose their jobs.  We should not let this go through on the nod.  We must discuss it seriously and whoever is returned following the election should seriously examine these trade agreements.  We should give everybody in the House a fair say and an opportunity to tease out the details of these agreements.  There must certainly be good elements in TTIP but there are also negative aspects.  It is a reasonable position to adopt.  I am disappointed that the Government used its majority on many of the committees to cut short or disallow debate on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100036#JJ00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1453387500,"counter":349,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that TTIP is being presented to us in very glowing terms but there are really serious concerns.  I listened to the Minister earlier but those concerns have not been addressed.  There are massive implications for workers' rights, food safety, agriculture, banking and education.  There are also implications for the environment and culture.  As it stands, this agreement will undermine and jeopardise the public good and it is a threat to our sovereignty.<\/p>  <p>  The ISDS mechanism is extremely worrying, as it means foreign investors will be able to sue a sovereign state - a democratically elected government - for a loss of profit resulting from public policy decisions.  I refer to what I and others in non-governmental organisations, trade unions, politics and civil society see as the aim of TTIP, which is to remove any regulatory barrier to profit and the profit-making potential of multinational and transnational companies.  There are examples of this and we know, the Canadian Government is being taken to court by oil and gas companies.  We have heard about the legal action being taken by tobacco companies relating to plain packaging.  We will see more countries being sued for massive amounts of money by multinational and transnational companies.  Countries need that money for vital services like health and education.<\/p>  <p>  There are real fears of an open door to a proliferation of private and for-profit schools and colleges.  TTIP has the potential to undermine the independence of our institutes of education and universities.  It can also limit the Government, the Minister responsible for education and the Department in framing our educational policy for the public good.  When I raised this educational aspect on Leaders' Questions with the Taoiseach, he stated that the negotiating teams were aware of the different elements and would consider this aspect.  Where are those negotiations and will education be excluded?<\/p>  <p>  There are also implications relating to culture as there is a strong possibility of cultural expression being damaged.  At the behest of France, there is a cultural exception protecting the tradition of French cinema from Hollywood blockbusters, so how can we protect our culture and theatre, for example, from the competition of major international production companies?  How can we protect Irish jobs in the cultural area, including those of writers, composers, directors, actors and musicians?  As it stands, they are very poorly paid and they have very unstable careers.  Their freelance status excludes them from many of the safeguards normally provided for those in employment and they will not be served well by TTIP.  There are also implications for the Irish language.<\/p>  <p>  I submitted a parliamentary question and the reply stated that, \"according to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive free trade deal between the EU and the US could, over time, boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum\".  The Centre for Economic Policy Research, on the other hand, has stated that EU GDP could grow by 0.48% over ten years.  This means a GDP growth of 0.048% per annum.  However, there is also a possibility of it being only 0.027% per annum.  The EU Trade Commissioner was also flying growth at 0.5% per annum.  It is all very misleading.<\/p>  <p>  There are real concerns about the loss of foreign direct investment because of TTIP, and a freedom of information request by a journalist suggested that the IDA had those concerns.  We need an honest and open debate on TTIP with real information about its effects on public services, education, health, food, farming, the environment and foreign direct investment.  There is also a danger that TTIP could allow the US multinationals to bypass Ireland to gain entry to the EU markets.  Are we sleepwalking into a disaster with misleading and inaccurate information?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's earlier comments about the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, did not allay the worries and concerns, especially regarding climate change.  I raised this on Leaders' Questions on 6 May 2015, at which stage the Taoiseach promised a debate.  It has been a very long time coming.  At the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I expressed fears that we would not get an opportunity to discuss all this in the detail it needs.  While the carrot is access to a potential market of hundreds of millions of people, giving corporations so much power over our democracies is a very high price to pay for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100036#JJ00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1453388100,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I slightly disagree with Deputy Crowe, although I generally agree with his analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100037#KK00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1453388100,"counter":351,"content":"<p>That was when I went off script.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100037#KK00300","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1453388100,"counter":352,"content":"<p>There is nothing to recommend TTIP, the Trade in Services Agreement, TISA, the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement or any of these so-called free trade treaties.  They are nothing more than the next phase in the corporate takeover of economic life with a very serious consequence for democracy, essentially bypassing and subverting normal democracy.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background to this, it is worth referring to the presence today of the Taoiseach in the luxury Swiss resort of Davos, where he is hobnobbing with the world&rsquo;s billionaires and the CEOs of the world&rsquo;s richest companies.  If they bothered to pay tax, we might have less global poverty and homelessness, less of a housing crisis and we might have the resources we need for our infrastructure and our public services.  However, because of these greedy oligarchs, whose greed seems to know no bounds and whose level of wealth and earnings is obscene in the extreme, our public services and infrastructure are chronically under-resourced.<\/p>  <p>  These people do not believe in paying taxes and their greed for profit is boundless, to the point that the 65 richest individuals in the world own more wealth between them than the poorest 50% of the world's population.  It is shocking and obscene.  Today, in Davos, the Taoiseach is sucking up to those greedy people.  Instead of asking corporation representatives why they do not pay their taxes, the Taoiseach is sucking up to these oligarchs and tax dodgers, and is facilitating, as are other EU leaders, the sort of agreements that will further advance the control the multinationals have over our economic life, public services and infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  TTIP is nothing to do with increasing trade.  Tariffs between the US and Europe are already very low, and more serious estimates of the trade increase that will result from TTIP put it at approximately 0.1%, which is negligible.  As the proponents of TTIP admit, it is about removing what they call barriers.  They are worried about barriers to the advance of the multinational corporations, particularly to grab control of public services, areas from which they have been excluded due to public provision.  This is where it relates directly to homelessness and our housing and health service crises.  Multinationals want to move into those areas and take over.  They want to expand private healthcare in order to make money from it and grab control of the housing market, and our Government is facilitating it with such agreements.<\/p>  <p>  The ISDS mechanism will be the means by which democratically elected governments representing the people will be unable to prevent the privatisation of services, defend the collective-bargaining rights of trade unions, enforce proper health and safety regarding food or protect the environment, among a range of other issues.  It relates to issues such as water.  Recently, as a result of an ISDS-style court decision, the Argentine Government was required to pay &euro;405 million in compensation to water giant Suez because it had reversed the privatisation of the Buenos Aires water utility after the corporation sought a 60% increase in water charges.<\/p>  <p>  Does this start to ring some warning bells about what is happening here and with regard to Government assurances that we will prevent our water services from being privatised?  No.  Once these agreements have been implemented, we will not have the right to protect our water services from privatisation.  Multinational giants, which are already privatising Irish Water through the back door, will be able to simply tell Governments they are not allowed to subsidise water services or infrastructure or keep the corporations out of the market for water, health, education or housing.  It will not be allowed.  TTIP will destroy jobs, small and medium enterprise, environmental protection, labour rights and trade union rights.  We must oppose it, root and branch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100037#KK00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1453388100,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on TTIP.  The debate has been a long time coming to the D&aacute;il.  It is interesting that it is only in the dying days of the D&aacute;il that a short amount of time has been allowed for it.  Much has been made of the TTIP ISDS mechanism and much public outcry has focused on how it provides for secret tribunals whereby corporations can take states to court for blocking their commercial and business interests.  Under the other free trade agreements, corporations that take states to court under the ISDS system win 60% of cases.  There has been a reaction to the public outcry about ISDS.<\/p>  <p>  Included in the TTIP negotiations is an equally insidious system of regulatory co-operation between the sides, which will enable decisions to be made without public oversight or engagement.  Businesses will be involved from the beginning of this secretive process, well before any public debate takes place, and will have excellent opportunities to ditch important initiatives.  I refer to the regulatory convergence which is included in the TTIP negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  Regulatory convergence comprises three main processes.  The first process is mutual recognition of standards by two trading blocs.  The second is harmonisation of standards.  The Government and the EU will make much of the fact that EU food production regulations are much higher and more stringent than those in the US, which will benefit us.  However, if mutual recognition is followed by harmonisation, the harmonisation may drag the higher standard down to meet the lower standard rather than the other way around.<\/p><p>Regulatory co-operation is the third aspect of regulatory convergence.  Under TTIP's chapter on regulatory co-operation, any future measure that could lead us towards a more sustainable food system, for example, could be deemed a barrier to trade and thus rejected before it sees the light of day.  Under regulatory convergence, businesses can at an early stage try to block rules intended to prevent, for example, the food industry from marketing foodstuffs with toxic substances or regulations to protect consumers.  These would typically be classified as non-tariff barriers.  New regulations would undergo an impact assessment primarily tilted towards the interests of business and should it go against their interests, the report will have to cite a detrimental impact on transatlantic trade as the rationale.<\/p> <p> The EU model gives business many tools that will allow them to object to an envisaged or planned regulatory act and even regulations under view.  A regulatory exchange must take place if a party is unhappy with the effect of a proposed rule on its trade interests.  A dialogue must take place and the party whose rules are under attack has no choice but to co-operate.  Businesses may also propose their own regulations or seek to rewrite existing ones.<\/p> <p> The European Commission proposes that \"the Parties shall endeavour to ensure compliance with this Chapter by authorities at levels of government lower than EU Member State or US State level\", i.e., municipalities and regional authorities.  This would broaden the scope of regulatory co-operation to affect city planning, public procurement, natural resources and environmental policies at a very local level.<\/p> <p> I think this process of regulatory convergence would render ISDS redundant in the long term as business will effectively be able to intervene at the drafting stage of new regulations or legislation, bring forward their own proposals for legislation or regulation and bring forward amending proposals for existing regulations.  At the very least, having revealed pending rule changes and given careful consideration to the response of business, governments would be susceptible to regulatory chill brought on by the perceived threat of ISDS cases if the corporations did not agree with what they proposed.<\/p> <p> We must look at TTIP negotiations and all other free trade negotiations in the context of globalisation and the growing inequality across the world.  Deputy Boyd Barrett outlined how 63 people hold more wealth than half the population of the rest of the world - 3.5 billion people.  The growth in income inequality across the world has deepened as all these free trade agreements have rolled out.  There is no doubt that TTIP is another step along that road to strengthen that inequality and for that reason alone, we should oppose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100037#KK00500","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453388700,"counter":355,"content":"<p>It interesting that we are having this debate when the wealthiest people in the world are congregating in Davos to discuss the world economic situation.  The recent Oxfam report, which showed a massive and increasing transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, was interesting.  People have mentioned different numbers.  The figures I have show that 62 people, 53 of which are men, have as much wealth as the poorest 50% of the world's population - 3.5 billion people.  The top 1% now own more than the other 99%.  What a world we are living in when we have a situation where that amount of wealth has been transferred to that top 1% over the past decade.  An Oxfam spokesperson said that this accelerating inequality was the result of policy choices and I agree with him.  These policy choices are the same policies being negotiated in TTIP.<\/p>  <p>  Essentially, TTIP is about strengthening the position of transnational corporations and further weakening the rights of workers and trade unions.  I am not the only one who believes this.  Many trade unions and non-governmental organisations also believe it is happening.  It has been kept behind closed doors since 2001 and only when people started asking questions were governments, ministers and MEPs forced to step out of that dark room.  It seeks to open up public services to these corporations and to reduce regulation across a wide range of matters like food safety, the environment, banking and the rights of national governments.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned mutual recognition and harmonisation.  I am particularly concerned about food safety.  I believe TTIP will attempt to introduce EU standards closer to those of the US.  A total of 70% of all food sold in US supermarkets contains genetically modified ingredients while food sold in the EU contains none.  The US allows growth hormones in beef while the EU does not.  The US has much looser regulation on the use of pesticides.  The EU bans 1,200 products for use in cosmetics while in the US, only 12 are banned.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has admitted that TTIP will cost jobs in Europe.  The North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, a similar agreement to TTIP involving the US, Canada and Mexico, has brought about the loss of 1 million US jobs as opposed to the increase that was promised when it was first initiated.<\/p>  <p>  TTIP is a threat to democracy.  One of its main aims is the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, which will allow corporations to sue governments if government policies cause a loss of profits.  This is the reason why it is there.  It is one of the most insidious parts of TTIP.  I simply do not believe the points made by the Minister earlier and his promises on workers' rights, safety and environmental laws, public service and regulations.  The entire purpose of TTIP is to weaken these areas to facilitate transnational corporations.  This is why MEPs in the European Parliament voted to postpone a decision on TTIP in the summer reflecting the huge concern among ordinary people and the pressure put on MEPs.

It is widely acknowledged not by me but by different farming organisations that if this goes ahead, it will put the farming community, particularly small family farms, under severe threat.  Do we want that to happen?  When we joined the EU, we had 300,000 farmers.  Now we have 100,000 or 110,000.  Do we want to wipe it out because of TTIP?<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that given the way this is going, Ireland will be shafted when it comes to multinationals because with the joined-up partnership between the EU and the US, they can sidestep Ireland.  We need to be wise to this.  The IDA is trying to bring in multinationals.  It is known that it is expressing real concerns about it.  Why do we not listen to these, acknowledge what is going on and stall the ball until things are done properly?  I would be very much opposed to it.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at the figures, SMEs would be under threat as well.  We must look at the overall picture around the world.  Something is not right about big corporate entities being able to take a government to court.  Smaller countries like Ireland will suffer.<\/p><p>Everything needs to be gone through line by line.  It would not be good for Ireland to be part of TTIP.  Europe is negotiating it but we should have a veto, some way of pulling the plug on it.  Many Members of the European Parliament opposed it in their debates on it.  Something is wrong when that comes from all sides in politics.  Approximately 3.5 million people have signed the petition.  They have not done that for the craic.  Politicians everywhere have a responsibility to listen to people.  There is no point regretting something we did wrong.  Let us make sure we do something right.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation needs to go to the European Commission and express the concerns of the Irish people and consider the fact of what this will do to our country.  Do we want to be in a market where we are overpowered?  We are not able to control one beef baron in this country, never mind taking on a country that will hammer us in the meat industry, especially one of the strongest countries in the world. <\/p> <p> Governments around Europe tend to agree with whatever the European Commission says it is doing.  The day has come to call a halt to that and make sure that we represent our people and country, not big corporate interests and not to fall into the hands of America.  We can do deals with America.  We export a lot of goods to America and there is no problem doing so.  Why then are we going down this other road, putting so much at risk?  We should stop it now.  The EU is trying to take away many of our powers but we should use whatever power or veto we have to block this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100038#LL00500","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453389300,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.

There were many such criticisms.  In Ireland 187,000 people are employed in multinationals.  Most of them set the standards in respect of the quality of the working environment.  Most are exacting about the quality of consumer and environmental standards they observe in running their businesses because they recognise that success, and that of any company, is built on its reputation for protecting workers and their environment.  We should not portray this trade agreement in terms of men in black hats and men in white hats, of extreme powers trying to undermine our society.  The truth is that two governments are coming together to see if the interests of the American people can be served by getting better trade flows with Europe.  The people representing Europe are considering the areas where there could be improvements to our mutual advantage.<\/p><p>Each side has different concerns.  We come wanting to see that our companies get a chance to bid for public procurement in the United States.  We have many wonderful software countries that could add great value if they could have fair access into some US contracts but they are kept out by America&rsquo;s policies.  Deputy Fitzmaurice knows better than most that the medical devices industry is very strong in the west of Ireland.  Someone who develops a medical device would like to see it recognised fairly quickly to promote it into the US and not to have to replicate all the tests to prove its worth for EU standards, at significant cost, in the US.  There are genuine opportunities for good companies to develop real changes that would help everyone.<\/p><p>The investment protection will not affect our right to make or change laws in Ireland.  Most of the commentary from our colleagues who have sadly left the Chamber inferred that under investment protection, there was an opportunity for companies to prevent governments from changing regulation.  The treaty states: <\/p><blockquote>1. The provisions of this section shall not affect the right of the Parties to regulate within their territories through measures necessary to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, safety, environment or public morals, social or consumer protection or promotion and protection of cultural diversity. <br \/><br \/>2. For greater certainty, the provisions of this section shall not be interpreted as a commitment from a Party that it will not change the legal and regulatory framework, including in a manner that may negatively affect the operation of covered investments or the investor&rsquo;s expectations of profits.<\/blockquote><p>It states very clearly that no company can challenge the right of the Government to change laws for environmental, health or workers&rsquo; protection.  That is written into the agreement, which is in the public domain.  I hear talk that this is being done under cover, there is no transparency but the documents are there for anyone to read. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100039#MM00400","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1453389300,"counter":363,"content":"<p>They have only been there for the past 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100039#MM00500","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1453389300,"counter":364,"content":"<p>There are some restricted documents.

There is horse-trading at the end of any deal and people will not show their bottom lines at the start.  Some things will not be revealed.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a lot of commentary on the ideologies that separate us.  I welcome our different ideologies and a genuine debate about this.  However, what I find frustrating about the debate is that no matter what our ideology it should not blind us to the text and what changes are proposed, yet much of the discussion ignores issues such as water.  It is explicit: the EU-US agreement will exclude water.<\/p><p>In all EU member states, services considered as public utilities at a national or local level may be subject to public monopolies or to exclusive rights granted to private operators.  That is copper-fastened into the text we already know about.  However, a few moments ago we heard Deputy Boyd Barrett pretend it was not there.  We have to be honest about the debate.  I am all in favour of more time to discuss this and tease it out, as many people suggested.  I have gone to all the committees and talked to their members.  I am happy to do that.  If I am here in a position of responsibility I will continue to do that.  In response to Deputy Fitzmaurice's question, I go to Europe to set out our concerns and investigate how particular items might affect us.<\/p> <p> Some people highlighted that a number of governments, including the Irish Government, have suggested that we should not be stampeded into dropping the ISDS without considering what an ISDS might do for it.  I think that was absolutely the right thing to do.  An investor dispute settlement system can protect small Irish companies trading with companies the US and have multiple states in which to deal.  It can be a good arrangement to protect them if they are being subjected to the sort of abuse I cited in my earlier speech.<\/p> <p> It is highly restricted.  A company must be subject to discrimination in a blatant form.  It is worth reading them out again.  There must be a denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings; a fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency; manifest arbitrariness; targeted discrimination on manifestly wrong grounds and so on.  Those are the only circumstances in which a company can take a case to an ISDS.<\/p> <p> When an organisation goes to the ISDS, the system will be overseen by people who are either judges or fit to be judges.  The procedures will be transparent.  There will be an appeal mechanism to an independent system where the US and the EU, representing the peoples of both jurisdictions, agree to the format of the court.  This is not some special deal to allow corporations to change laws and distort the will of ordinary citizens and the European Union has sought to set that out.<\/p> <p> I do not want my explanation of what is there and how it addresses some of the Deputy's criticisms to be portrayed as saying I go in dewy-eyed believing everything in this agreement is alright and we should sleepwalk our way to signing up to it - by no means.  We need to look at every line and every element.  That is why our officials are out there every month cross-examining the negotiators to see what is happening in different areas, protecting our interests and ensuring that when this deal is hopefully agreed, it will bring benefit to all our people.<\/p> <p> I know Deputy Wallace is no longer here.  I would love to debate what he described as general equilibrium models, which he tells me a first-year student would know are useless.  General equilibrium models are what they say on the packet.  They are an attempt to model how this might work.  They are not absolutely accurate and just give broad signposts.  There are no broad signposts in this agreement that suggest it will undermine employment, reduce wages, undermine environmental standards or any of the other things portrayed about it.  Anyone looking at this who seeks to see the signposts, sees benefit in it but also warns us that we need to protect ourselves and look at sectors that are vulnerable.  We need to support those sectors if challenges come their way.  That is the approach I will take.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for their participation.  This will remain a very hot topic in the future.  I hope that we can share some of the documents that are out there so the debate is at least focused on the genuine contents of the agreement rather than some of the strawmen that have been portrayed here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100039#MM00600","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2015: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1453389900,"counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100040#NN00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453389900,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1453389900,"counter":368,"content":"<p>The Government has always been very supportive of the tourism industry.  When this Government came into office in 2011, the first budget introduced a one third reduction in VAT in the hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%.  That stimulated and incentivised, and was an enormous success in bringing about record levels of tourism this year.  However, the hospitality sector has not reciprocated.  It has once again become greedy.  Hotel occupancy levels in this city are at an all-time high - Dublin has the highest bed occupancy of 50 cities looked at by PricewaterhouseCoopers last year.  This year is projected to be the same.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the doubling of money from the State from &euro;150 million to &euro;300 million, which will allow us to engage in extra enterprises, projects and services related to the tourism industry.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to point the Minister of State and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to what I regard as the greatest opportunity in Dublin at present.  In recent decades there has been neglect of the tourism potential of the Dublin docklands.  While regeneration has been going on for almost 30 years since the Urban Renewal Bill 1986 was introduced, nothing has been done about the potential of the docklands.  There are docklands not just in Dublin but throughout the country that have enormous potential.  However, Dublin is special.  While the docklands have been the subject of regeneration for almost 30 years, this has only consisted of bricks and mortar - office blocks and housing.  There is an enormously rich heritage on the docks, going back over hundreds of years, which has been totally neglected.  At the junction of the River Liffey, the Royal Canal and the Irish Sea, we have Dublin Port.  It has some incredible maritime, inland waterways and industrial history stretching back to the Vikings.  This year we celebrate the centenary of the foundation of the State in 1916.  The Lockout took place in 1913.  Throughout that period normal docker activity took place there.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Dockworkers Preservation Society is doing Trojan work to highlight the potential in that respect.  At present Dublin City Council is carrying out a heritage audit of the docklands under the auspices of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, following my request.  There is an enormous amount of paraphernalia and material associated with the docklands currently in the port and in other storage areas, with the Dublin Dockworkers Preservation Society, in folklore activities being done on an individual basis and otherwise, and we need to avail of that resource.<\/p>  <p>  We need to establish a Dublin docklands heritage trail that would attract thousands of tourists and could rival - I am sure the Minister of State will be delighted to hear me say this - the Wild Atlantic Way that has been set up in recent years and is a wonderful asset that attracts tourists to an area they might otherwise not visit.  It would also provide gainful and sustainable employment to the local docklands communities which, of course, have been ravaged over the years.  The regeneration that has taken place has largely left them behind.  With the extra funding being provided, this is something that F&aacute;ilte Ireland could seek to address.  It could establish one of the finest tourist attractions anywhere in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100040#NN00400","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1453390500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister of State on his hard work in the Department.  It is work that is being rewarded and noted across the country, particularly in the area of tourism where there has been a significant return to growth under his stewardship.  This revival is positive.  It is not confined to one place, one town, one city or one region, it is very diverse.  That is one of the characteristics of the current revival.  Every district is experiencing the return of tourists.  My sister in Donegal, who is familiar with the remoter parts of the county, told me the other day that the tourists are back.  This is welcome in our part of the country.<\/p>  <p>  We need to evaluate and develop new tourism products at macro level.  Historically, there has been an over-reliance on landscape and literature in the context of attracting tourists to Ireland.  We must diversify in a radical way and develop new tourism products and projects.  In that context, I suggest the development of industrial heritage tourism, an area which has been severely neglected to date.  That fact was borne out for me dramatically when I recently visited the Workshops Rail Museum in Ipswich, a suburb just outside Brisbane, Australia.  There they have all the great engines and rail technology with men working in a real live workshop with a museum alongside it.  We could not get in the first day we visited it because of the queues and had to go back the next morning.  There one can see all the old decorative carriages used to transport kings and queens, along with the entire range of rail technology, tools, etc.  There are men who have worked there for years, demonstrating how one can take lumps of stone and turn them into molten lava to shape materials in the making and restoration of rail engines.  Children watch this wide-eyed with schools queueing up for these direct experiences of technology and manufacturing.  There are also trips on the old trains.  It was a very enjoyable experience and the type of tourism project we should be considering.<\/p>  <p>  While I was there, one of the men working there asked me, because I come from Ireland, if I had heard of the Inchicore railway works.  I said I had because I live only five minutes from them.  He said the Inchicore railway works was the daddy of them all.  It was one of the great engineering complexes on this island, founded in the middle of the 19th century.  It has a great repository of skills and achievements, along with great output and feats of engineering and design.  Trains and carriages have gone all over the world from those works.<\/p>  <p>  When we are looking at new categories of tourism development, it would be appropriate that we might take a leaf out of the book of the Workshops Rail Museum in Ipswich, Brisbane, and see how that could be replicated in Inchicore.  The Inchicore railway works is on an 80 acre site with rows and rows of old buildings that are no longer used.  The staff at the works are keen to see such a development because, on their own, they cannot conserve and care for old engines and carriages properly because there are not enough resources going into it.  While railway museums are commonplace in the UK, we have neglected our industrial heritage.  This shows disrespect and a disregard for the skills, work and output of ordinary people across hundreds of years.  We are very good with our literature and our landscape but we must not forget the great output of ordinary people in manufacturing, probably best exemplified in places like the Inchicore railway works.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State consider getting behind the Inchicore railway works, the local community and the local heritage groups who have been developing many projects in the area such as the Royal Hospital, the memorial park and other clusters of tourism attractions?  Perhaps he might visit the railway works and see how a railway museum, which would be a fitting tribute to the achievements of that area, could be considered and developed over time.  This is a project which would break new ground and diversify our cultural tourism products.  We need to be innovative.  We have developed and exploited the tourism potential of our landscape and literature but we must diversify into new tourism projects.  The Minister of State has shown that he is not afraid to break new ground.  I hope he will visit the railway works at Inchicore and break new ground in industrial heritage tourism by developing a railway museum at the site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100041#OO00100","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1453390500,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Keating who is sharing time with Deputy McNamara.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100041#OO00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1453390500,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McNamara for sharing time with me.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2015, part of which gives additional funding to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and makes it more accountable to the D&aacute;il.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, for taking part in this Second Stage debate.  It is no surprise that tourism and sport are inextricably linked in a Department.  When we fund one, it helps promote the other.  For example, tourism would benefit if our application for the 2023 Rugby World Cup was successful.  I know 27,000 Irish fans have already applied for tickets for the European football championship this year.  One can see how tourism and sport are inextricably linked.  One of the Government&rsquo;s great successes has been in the whole area of tourism and sport.  In our first budget, we turned everything on its head by reducing the VAT rate for tourism-related activities to 9% which has been very successful.  From all quarters, we hear how our tourism prospects have been enhanced by that measure.<\/p>  <p>  In sport, the Minister of State has opened up a variety of different grants, including sports capital grants.  Recently, I had the opportunity of welcoming a Spanish family who were touring the country to my home community.  They have been in touch with me regularly and told me the other day they brought their children swimming.  Of course, they did not find a swimming pool in our local community but in Clondalkin.  I happened to have opened that swimming pool as deputy mayor of South Dublin County Council in 2007.  It is a wonderful facility which enhances the well-being not only of the local community but of visitors and tourists alike.<\/p>  <p>  I noted the Minister of State recently provided an opportunity for expressions of interests for a new swimming pool programme.  I have contacted my local authority to encourage it to meet the deadline.  Will the Minister of State look on its application favourably?<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I acknowledge the wonderful work that has been done by the local volunteers in the Pool4Lucan campaign.  As a councillor in 2006 and 2007, I held the plans for that pool in my hands.  I hope it is nearing an advanced stage and that it will be become reality in the very near future, thanks to 20 years of campaigning on my part and that of many others.  It will benefit the overall well-being of the community, visitors and tourists alike.  <\/p> <p> I accompanied the Minister of State on visits to many clubs.  Many clubs in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West will benefit from sports capital grants that the Minister of State's Department announced in recent years.  That will ensure that more local people, as well as tourists, will benefit from those quality facilities.<\/p> <p> A great concern I have about our tourism sector, to which my colleagues, Deputies Costello and Buttimer, alluded, is the high price of hotel accommodation.  I am a Dublin Deputy living in west Dublin, which is the gateway to tourism in the west.  Occasionally, when there are late sittings or early morning sittings, I stay in town, like many of my rural colleagues who must stay in town when the D&aacute;il is sitting.  I have seen the incremental increase in the price of hotel rooms.  I want to send out the strongest possible message about this and I ask the Minister of State to join me, in whatever appropriate way his office can, in appealing to the hotel industry to consider the damage that will be done to our tourism industry if those high prices are maintained.  We must put a stop to that.  <\/p> <p> We are investing a good deal in the tourism sector.  Reference was made to the Wild Atlantic Way initiative, which is a wonderful one.  Despite such investment, the high price of hotel rooms and, consequently, the high cost of visiting this country will be disincentive for many people to visit it.  We need to marry our natural resources and our natural environment, which is such an attraction for so many people in the world, with the initiatives being rolled out and the facilities we have in place.  We need to be very careful with respect to our hotel industry that we do not go the way we did a number of years ago and damage our prospects.  I will conclude on that point as I want to allow time for Deputy McNamara to contribute.  I thank him for sharing his time with me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100041#OO00300","speaker":"1012","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453391100,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, far from listening to Members speak about the delights of every constituency, the Minister of State wants to get back to County Mayo to see the delights of his own constituency and perhaps knock on some doors but whether that will be delightful will be up to him.<\/p>  <p>  Most Members support this amending legislation, the work being in tourism and the Minister of State's work in that regard, as do I, and I commend him on it.  I also commend the Government on the work it has done in the tourism sector.  I do not always agree with the Government but tourism is one of the areas where it has got it right and I am very happy to support it.  Deputy Keating mentioned the Wild Atlantic Way which is a route that goes through my constituency.  I would like to see it tweaked in places and more of the estuary included in it but it has been an excellent initiative.  I believe a civil servant in the Department came up with the idea and that it is a Civil Service rather than a political initiative.  Regardless of where the idea came from - civil servants do not always get praised in the House as politicians have a tendency to praise themselves and their colleagues rather than the Civil Service - this is an excellent initiative and one that is bringing tourists to the country.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to discuss a lakelands initiative, which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, when in the Minister of State's Department, advanced and I was very glad about that.  I grew up in east Clare beside Lough Derg and large numbers of tourists came to see Lough Derg and cycle around it.  There are much fewer tourists now than there was in the past, not only fewer in comparison to the number of tourists going to other areas but fewer in real terms.  It is an area that needs to be marketed.  There is a specific market for lakelands-based tourism, not only in Clare but across the country, including in Cavan, Galway and lakelands generally.  The Masurian Lake District in Poland is an area that draws a considerable number of tourists.<\/p>  <p>  A report that was published, which preceded this promotional drive, stated that Lough Derg lacked an iconic sight around which it could be marketed in the way that the Cliffs of Moher are pretty iconic to the Wild Atlantic Way.  It would be churlish not to acknowledge the work of Clare County Council at the Cliffs of Moher.  It recently bought Inis Cealtra or Holy Island, which is quite iconic when one is driving around Lough Derg.  It is quite clear that it should be the site around which Lough Derg is marketed.  Much more needs to be done in that respect.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Keating spoke about the link between tourism and sport and it is important that they are dealt with together.  It is also important that we deal with tourism and culture together.  I have been quite critical of the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and its failure to advance UNESCO World Heritage status for many of the sites on the tentative list, which includes Holy Island or Inis Cealtra but it is much broader than that.  I met the UNESCO personnel dealing with the Irish file off my own bat in Paris and they were surprised to meet somebody from Ireland.  That is not good enough and it does not demonstrate a sufficiency of joined-up thinking between Departments.  <\/p>  <p>  Very few tourists come to Ireland for the sunshine; nobody comes here to get a sun tan.  People are increasingly coming here for sport but many people come here for culture and we need to do much more to get our sites onto the UNESCO World Heritage list.  Currently, it is left to the county councils and the problem is that there is a number of cluster sights.  For example, with respect to the early monastic sites, I think Durrow, Clonmacnoise, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice are the five and with respect to western stone forts, if I am not mistaken, they fall across counties Kerry, Clare and Galway.  In the case of these early monastic sites, Offaly County Council is not that keen on idea of advancing Clonmacnoise and that is holding up all the others.  We need to be imaginative about this and if one council does not want to go forward with this, the other councils should not be hindered.  We need to drive this nationally because it is important not only for individual areas but it is hugely important to protect and promote Inis Cealtra, Clonmacnoise and Durrow.  All of those bring a benefit beyond the region in which they are located because they bring tourists into the country.  I would very much like to see this being driven.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that there is a potential to increase the budget of Bord F&aacute;ilte but we need to have more debate on what Bord F&aacute;ilte does and on having more joined-up thinking.  I appreciate the Minister of State wishes to get to Mayo and I will not delay him any further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100042#PP00200","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1453391100,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate and offered their views on the overall development of Irish tourism.

Deputy Dooley spoke about ensuring that we maintain value for money and, of course, we must do that.  We have a favourable external factor at present but that might not always be there and we must ensure we are competitive, that our pricing structure is competitive and that we have a quality product which will attract tourists.  I was delighted to hear his support for the Wild Atlantic Way and the signature projects.  In regard to tourism policy, we are aware of the risks.  A regional spread is very important.  In terms of capital investment, we need to invest more in the towns and regions to give people an opportunity to have the product they need to bring tourists to the regions.<\/p>  <p>  A theme common to all the contributions was the need to ensure we maintain value for money and the importance of competitiveness.  Deputy Fitzmaurice spoke about retaining value for money.  He also spoke about the River Shannon and the lakelands and the great potential they offer.  We are aware of that great potential and a study is being carried out to examine how we can get the most out of it, such as the Blueway tourism initiative.<\/p><p>Currently, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is partnering with Waterways Ireland and local authorities to develop tourism along the Shannon waterway and associated wetlands, and work is under way to develop an experience brand, such as Ireland's Ancient East or the Wild Atlantic Way, centred on the unique aspects of life along the river.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is currently working with Waterways Ireland as the lead on the development of blueways.  There has been a focus on greenways and the Wild Atlantic Way and the blueways will have something to do with water.<\/p> <p> Deputies Jim Daly and Anthony Lawlor referred to the importance of communities and getting them involved in tourism.  The Wild Atlantic Way would not have worked but for the fact that people and communities bought into it.  If that does not happen on the east coast Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East will not develop.  People cannot expect F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Government to do everything for them.  Communities, businesses and those involved in tourism in the area must buy into the concept in the coming years.  The Ancient Irish East has the same potential as the Wild Atlantic Way and I hope people buy into it.<\/p> <p> We are up against very stiff competition internationally but the Wild Atlantic Way is competing with the best in the world.  We are currently promoting Dublin and Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East and we are winning the battle.  In the context of tourism, one can talk about jobs, the Government, communities and the favourable rate of the dollar versus the euro at the moment.  However, we must thank the trade also.  Sometimes people on all sides of the House forget what the trade itself does.  I have been on trade missions with many businesses from this country.  The tourism sector does two things.  It works very hard and those involved put their hand in their pocket and accompany F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to promote their products abroad.  They take major risks.  In recent years the tourism sector has gone through a very difficult time.  People have had to work harder for less profit and some found themselves in major debt.  People are working their way out of that.  People put a lot of work into it and those involved are to be complimented on the great work they do.  Sometimes we forget the major investment they make.<\/p> <p> Deputy Buttimer spoke about F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the context of the Cork local authorities and how they are working closely to promote a new brand for Cork.  I hope the local authorities, communities and everybody else will work together in that regard.  Cork is in a unique position.  Deputy Buttimer referred to people coming into the area from Cork Airport, which presents a great opportunity for the city and region.  The tourism sector must work on the Wild Atlantic Way brand because that is in its interest.  If tourists land in Cork Airport they can travel to west Cork, Clare, Galway, elsewhere in the west and they can also go to the city of Dublin.  The area has an opportunity and I expect those involved in the tourism sector will make the most of it.<\/p> <p> Regardless of whoever is here after the election perhaps F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland could come to the Oireachtas on a Wednesday to explain what it is doing.  I brought Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to public meetings around the country.  People do not realise what the tourism bodies are doing.  The Bill before the House relates to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which deals with the domestic market while Tourism Ireland deals with the international market.  We have small teams that work very hard.  Sometimes we forget that.  In recent years, tourism, like every other sector had to fight for funding.  That is difficult when one is competing with areas such as health and education.  Perhaps tourism funding was cut more than should have been the case.  The reduction in the VAT rate was the one great thing that happened.<\/p> <p> The common denominator in contributions from Members in today&rsquo;s debate was hotel prices around the country but in particular in Dublin.  I wish to set down a marker today to the hotel industry.  The VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% but that will not be the case indefinitely if hotels continue to increase prices and disrupt the market in any way.  Tourism is a national product that spans the west, the cities and the entire country working together.  We do not want any sector damaging the tourism trade.  I warn hotels about prices because there has been much talk about the price of hotels in Dublin.  We went through a difficult time four or five years ago and we are now recovering.  Every single year since we came into Government there has been an increase in hotel prices.  I wish to put that on the record.<\/p> <p> People can talk about favourable factors such as the strength of the dollar versus the euro but last year, 8.2 million people came into this country.  It was not only the best year in the past five years or the best year since the recession, it was the best year ever for tourism in this country and that created almost &euro;3.5 billion for the State.  In recent years the tourism industry has proven itself.  More than 205,000 people are employed in the sector and we hope to increase that to 250,000.  Between now and 2025 we hope to increase tourism numbers to 10 million per annum.  We must work together and help and support one another.  The Government must play its part, as must F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, and the industry itself.  We must never go back again to the bad old days in terms of the prices that were charged in this country.<\/p> <p> When I took over this job my first task was to deal with The Gathering.  The Taoiseach asked me to go all over Britain and to America and to try to get people to visit this country.  The common denominator in every part of Britain was the price structure in this country.  When people came for The Gathering they got value for money and they were not ripped off.  They enjoyed their visit and when they went back home they acted as our ambassadors.  They told people there was value to be got in Ireland.  We must make sure the value is maintained.<\/p> <p> Deputy Costello referred to the proposal for the Dublin docklands area.  He is correct that it is a very good proposal.  A number of walks are already organised in Dublin and we can examine other options.  The more we have the better.  Deputy Conaghan mentioned industrial tourism.  That is something we must examine.  We must examine any product that we have.  People want to see something that is different.  They do not come here to sleep but to see the countryside and to see what we have to offer.  When they see we have many products the hope is that they will come back again.  Both of the ideas the Deputies mentioned are good ones.  Walks, greenways and the industrial heritage are all part of the tourism product.<\/p> <p> That is what today&rsquo;s Bill is about.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland can currently spend up to a limit of &euro;150 million but when the Bill is passed the limit will increase to &euro;300 million.  At the moment if the Government wants to give F&aacute;ilte Ireland &euro;160 million it cannot spend it because of the clear limit specified in the legislation of &euro;150 million.  I hope in the coming years F&aacute;ilte Ireland will get money from the Government to enhance the tourism product.  We need to spread the product all around the country and to look at different ideas and new thinking because one cannot allow the product to become stale.  One must freshen it up constantly and come up with new product ideas.  Deputy Keating also correctly referred to hotel pricing.  I have sent out a warning that the VAT rate is not set in stone forever.  We will monitor the situation on a regular basis.<\/p> <p> I thank all Members for their contributions.  I also thank my officials for the work they put into the Bill.  Tourism is going very well at the moment but we must be very careful, keep our eye on the ball and make sure we do not price ourselves out of the market.  We have gone through a difficult time but we are in now recovery and we must build on that.  Tourism jobs can be provided in every corner of the country, in particular places that will not attract multinational companies.  The one thing about tourism is that one can have an unusual project that will attract people.  More than 100 people are now employed on the greenway in Mayo.  It has given a boost to the towns of Newport, Mulranny and Achill.  When we started the greenway project people said it would not work.  People also said the Wild Atlantic Way would not work.  They said it was another gimmick by the Government and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Wild Atlantic Way will be seen as one of the greatest initiatives taken in this country.  It is only developing now and in the coming years more people will learn about it.<\/p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East is a new product.  It is one we are working on.  Dublin has its own unique selling point.  We are putting funding and a strategy in place because we must look ahead to a time when things will not be going as well.  We must compete with other cities around the world and we are doing that.<\/p><p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100042#PP00300","speaker":"1074","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453392300,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2015: Referral to Select Committee","time":1453392300,"counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100044#RR00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1453392300,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 6(<i>a<\/i>) and 126(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100044#RR00400","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453392300,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1453392300,"counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100044#RR00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Social Housing Provision","time":1453392300,"counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100044#RR00650"},{"type":"speech","time":1453392300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>This issue is quite important because of the amount of potential social housing that was available and is no longer available.  In December 2011, the National Assets Management Agency, NAMA, announced it would facilitate the provision of units for social housing over a period of time.  A steering group was established, comprising the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, NAMA, the Housing Agency, housing authorities and approved housing bodies with the purpose of achieving this objective.  It achieved its objective and NAMA put together a property portfolio of 6,574 units, all of which were offered to the 31 local authorities in which the properties were located.  One of the most bizarre features of the housing crisis is that only one third of those units were taken by the local authorities despite the fact that NAMA had approved all of those houses.  It had been done in consultation with the various other relevant bodies and agencies and the list had been compiled for the specific purpose of making a portfolio of social housing available.  It is bizarre that this happened in the middle of a homelessness and overcrowding crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 6,574 units, 4,048 were refused by the local authorities for one reason or another.  Of the 2,526 units that were confirmed, not all are occupied at present - 1,600 have been either contracted or delivered, 486 are still under negotiation and 440 are still under consideration, in other words, they have not even got to the stage of contractual arrangements.  The remaining 4,048 are no longer under consideration by the local authorities and, by and large, have been disposed of otherwise by NAMA because the local authorities did not want them.<\/p>  <p>  According to NAMA, the reasons for rejection by the local authorities fell into four categories - 1,130 were recorded as \"no demand\"; 1,175 were recorded as \"no sustainable communities\"; 84 were not suitable; and 1,579, the largest number, had been available but were no longer available after they were refused.  Some 6,574 units could have made a huge difference to the housing crisis - 4,048 units would have made a real difference, but they have now gone to the private sector.  The private sector's benefit is the State's loss.  The only conclusion one can come to is that a wonderful opportunity to address the homeless situation has been squandered and lost forever.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should demand a detailed explanation from each local authority as to why they did not avail of the NAMA offer.  One should not forget that this was not done in isolation: it was done with the Department, the housing authorities and the housing agencies.  It is incredible that some local authorities did not accept even one offer from NAMA - not one unit that was made available was accepted by some of the local authorities.  It boggles the mind that in current circumstances we find that we could have dented the worst problems of the homeless crisis and could have dealt with it very easily by availing of all the units that were available.  We now find ourselves in a situation in which the private sector has snapped up those units because the public sector, through the local authorities and the Housing Agency, has not bothered to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100044#RR00700","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1453392300,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Since December 2011, my Department has been working closely with NAMA, local authorities and approved housing bodies to maximise the social housing output available from the properties that are part of the security for loans which NAMA has acquired.  To the end of December 2015, a total of 2,000 NAMA residential properties have been secured for social housing use.  This comprises over 1,400 completed properties, where tenants are now <i>in situ<\/i>, and a further 574 that have been contracted and where completion work is ongoing.  A further 249 properties are considered to be active transactions where terms are agreed or active negotiation is ongoing by all parties concerned and where a detailed appraisal is being carried out.  An additional 341 properties are to be further appraised.  Overall, I expect that, at least, in excess of 2,200 units for social housing purposes will be secured from this engagement with NAMA.  By the end of December 2015, NAMA had identified a total of 6,634 properties as being potentially available for social housing.  Over the last number of years, local authorities and the Housing Agency have been working systematically through these units with NAMA to determine if there is a social housing demand for the properties identified.  The result of the effort will produce, as I have stated, more than 2,200 social housing units.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why local authorities may determine that units identified by NAMA are not suitable.  A small number of units were declined on the basis that they were not suitable for social housing either by virtue of the nature of the development, for example, they were holiday-type developments, the units were in areas of exceptionally high market rents or they required high management services charges and were therefore not viable.  Equally, local authorities may have determined that there was no demand for the particular type of units or no demand for social housing in particular locations.  In many cases, a demand for a smaller number of properties in the same development may have been confirmed with the balance declined on the basis that there was insufficient demand.  Alternatively, there may already have been a high concentration of social housing units in the development and to take further units for social housing would therefore not be consistent with the authority's commitment to mixed tenure and sustainable developments.  The properties under consideration are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired.  In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA.  Once a demand has been identified, NAMA makes contact with the relevant property owner or receiver to determine if the properties are still available and to discuss how these properties can be best utilised.<\/p><p>In some cases, while the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, initially had identified units as potentially available for social housing, when the local authority confirmed an interest in that property it emerged the unit subsequently had been sold or let by the relevant receiver or owner.<\/p> <p> Overall, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I are confident that local authorities have utilised every available opportunity to secure social housing units in this way in an effort to meet the housing needs of families in their areas, including those who are homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100044#RR00800","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453392900,"counter":386,"content":"<p>While I find it hard to disagree with the Minister of State, in this case I must.  I do not accept the local authorities could refuse nearly two thirds of the houses that had been identified as potential social housing properties by NAMA between December 2011 and December 2015 and that the agency would sell them off to the private sector, which snapped them up.  I am not satisfied the reasons given by the local authorities are adequate.  I note 1,130 were recorded in the category \"no demand\" according to the local authorities.  What does \"no demand\" mean?  There is huge demand for housing.  A further 1,275 units were recorded in the category \"no sustainable communities\" or, in other words, there were too many units on offer.  How does one determine there are too many units on offer when one has a housing crisis?  The local authorities decided not to take them.  A total of 84 units were recorded as not suitable, albeit not because it was not financially viable for them to be acquired or leased.  The local authorities did not wish to get into the business of management but I do not accept that reason either.  A further 1,579 units, which is the largest category, were recorded as being no longer available.  Of course they no longer are available, as four years went by and NAMA will not wait forever.  The receiver has a duty to sell or the owner will sell if the local authorities do not act in time.  This is an extremely flimsy argument on the part of the local authorities.  They literally have reneged on their responsibility as the housing authorities in Ireland.  Had those additional 4,000-plus units come into circulation despite the aforementioned categories, the housing crisis could have been dealt with much more effectively.  I must state that a more thorough and more detailed explanation is required from the local authorities as to why they turned down these units.  There are 31 local authorities, some of which turned everything down.  Others, such as Dublin City Council, rejected two thirds of them but the current position is that local authorities are trying to find as many units of accommodation as they can, anywhere, to try to house families that are homeless or are in severe need of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100045#SS00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1453392900,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I do not necessarily disagree with the Deputy that we should have acted sooner.  We all should have done many things before we reached this point.  I must admit delivery was extremely slow in the early stages of this process, given the mechanism for delivery of social housing was novel to all parties concerned.  Such novelty was accompanied by the added complexity of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints.  Against this backdrop, it is fair to state that significant progress has been made.  I am satisfied that the social housing potential of the approximately 4,000 units that are no longer under consideration has been explored in depth.  Many of these units were in areas of low demand while in areas where demand is high, such as Dublin, the list of units has been reviewed with units reconsidered when circumstances change.  There will continue to be active, ongoing engagement between NAMA and local authorities in respect of those units that remain under consideration for social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100045#SS00300","speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme Funding","time":1453392900,"counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100045#SS00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1453392900,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Some time ago, a specific scheme for financial instruments in agriculture and rural development was agreed by the European Investment Fund.  Together with Deputy Doyle, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I met Commissioner Hogan in Brussels and this scheme was one of the good news items he announced to us.  While he came to Ireland and spoke favourably of the scheme, I seek to ascertain what is going on between the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Commissioner Hogan.  Where is the money?  There is considerable investment in agriculture in Ireland.  One hears about how well performing it is and I am delighted it is performing so well.  As 61,000 new jobs have been created in Ireland in agriculture, forestry and fisheries since 2013, by any stretch this is a sector that is performing well.<\/p>  <p>  Many farmers are prepared to put their money into agriculture in the future and as the Minister of State is aware, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, is oversubscribed.  This is a scheme whereby a relatively small grant is made towards capital investment in farms such as farm buildings, etc.  The Department was obliged to go through the applications before Christmas - I should put on record I am glad it did - to identify and deal with those applicants who were seeking new investments in dairying, such as the building of new milking parlours.  Obviously, as cows are calving at this time of year and are beginning to start milking, work must be done and there was a certain amount of bureaucracy in the Department that delayed it.  Nevertheless, all these farmers are investing all this money and are borrowing it from the banks at normal business rates.  A rate of approximately 6.5% is the average for unsecured loans whereas a rate of approximately 4% obtains if the loan is secured.  However, Commissioner Hogan mentioned a rate of 1.5% and Members can imagine the difference such a rate would make to Irish farms.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, refers to productive farmers and appears to think that farmers from where Deputy Fitzmaurice and I come are not productive farmers, but are the ones who are waiting to be taken over by a productive farmer.  I do not accept the Minister's conceptualisation of Irish agriculture.  I note it is not his alone but also is the direction in which the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been going for nigh on 15 years through successive Governments.  However, even by the Minister's own definition of what amounts to a productive farmer, he is failing them because the people who are investing in big new slatted houses or big new milking parlours or who are buying land, becoming more productive and achieving economies of scale are borrowing huge sums of money.  Moreover, they are doing so at rates of 4.5% if the loan is secured and 6.5% if it is unsecured.  Why are such farmers unable to draw down money at a rate of 1.5%, when this is what was promised by Commissioner Hogan?  I believe he made this promise in good faith.  Some members of my party have taken issue with Phil Hogan and some of what he has done but he is on solid ground in this regard.  He pointed to specific examples of these funds being drawn down in other European countries.  One example he cited was Romania where huge amounts of money were made available.  People obviously are able to leverage more money when interest rates are lower.  They are able to borrow more or at least the cost of borrowing is lower for their businesses.  Second, banks are prepared to lend more where a guarantee scheme is in place and I note this is a guarantee scheme.  However, it is not being availed of in Ireland and I wish to know why not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100045#SS00500","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1453392900,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100045#SS00600","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1453392900,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Under the regulations governing the European Structural and Investment Funds, including the rural development programme, RDP, it is open to member states to fund interventions via financial instruments.  Essentially, financial instruments offer an alternative to the traditional grant-based approach whereby schemes under the RDP may be funded via loans, guarantee funds or equity investments.  The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on the existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD, funding as well as national Exchequer funding.  It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources such as the European Investment Bank for such instruments.<\/p>  <p>  Financial instruments must also be linked to a rural development programme measure and must respect the rules and restrictions applying to that particular measure.<\/p><p>The European Commission has indicated that it is aiming to double the use of these financial instruments in the 2014-20 programming period.  The most recent data shows that &euro;429 million has been allocated to financial instruments in seven programmes across five member states and a further 20 programmes, including Ireland, have committed to examine the possible use of financial instruments within the rural development programme.<br\/><br\/>The Department has been engaging with the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and other stakeholders in order to identify areas where financial instruments could be implemented to best strategic effect.  In order to include a financial instrument as a measure in the rural development programme an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation is required by EU regulation.  This evaluation can take between three months to a year to complete.  It includes a range of steps and must prove that financial instruments are required due to an investment gap in the market place.  Once this is done, an agreement must be reached between the Department and any other potential stakeholders or financial institutions on a clear investment strategy that is developed from the gaps, if any, identified in the <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation.  Following this, a new measure description would have to be drafted and inserted into the rural development programme by way of an amendment.<br\/><br\/>The Department continues to explore new and more competitive sources of funding for the agrifood sector.  For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, provides an agriculture investment loans product.  This credit is available at favourable terms for investments in primary agriculture products.  The features of the SBCI products compared with those currently on the market are lower interest rates, loan amounts up to &euro;5 million and increased repayment flexibility.  Since its launch, the SBCI has made &euro;750 million worth of low cost loans available for small and medium enterprises, including farmers.  In its last report, the SBCI stated that one third of the loans approved and drawn down by SMEs had been accessed by the agriculture sector.

I am slightly worried about what she says because she stated, \"an agreement must be reached between the Department and any other potential stakeholders or financial institutions on a clear investment strategy that is developed from the gaps, if any, identified.\"  Does that mean that the Minister of State's Department will discuss with the banks whether they should make low-interest loans available to farmers due to a gap in the market?  I suspect - as a matter of fact, I would be prepared to bet my farm on it - the banks will say there are no gaps and that there is nothing to see here.  Of course they will say there is nothing to see here.  Of course, they will not encourage the Government to provide loans at 1.5% when they are currently charging 6.5%, or 4.5% if the loan is secured.  They will say there are no gaps.<\/p>  <p>  We just heard about our housing crisis.  Why is our entire economy being sacrificed to the banks?  Farm loans have performed.  They are one type of loan that did perform.  The banks threw out loads of money on housing and those loans are not performing.  Every other area, including SMEs, farms and everyone else, along with their economic futures, is being held back so the banks can reclaim the money they threw out.  It seems bizarre in the extreme.  <\/p>  <p>  Joseph Stiglitz said today that Ireland would have been better off if we had been allowed to burn the bondholders.  That is not necessarily to say that we should have burned the bondholders because we were not allowed to do so.  We really have to look at the economic cost to this State of not burning the bondholders.  It means the money has to be repaid by the Exchequer if not the banks and the banks have to be helped to perform.  This is just one other example in a sector which is performing.  It is clear that agriculture is being held back by the banks.  It seems to me, reading between the lines, that the Department is giving the banks a veto in this area.  The banks do not want low-interest loans.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the SBCI.  The rates it is offering are one quarter of a percentage lower.  I was asked by SMEs about it.

It makes no sense whatsoever that someone decided to take from Roscommon a part of what is Roscommon's.  The position with regard to rates and future rates must also be considered.  People do not realise that, in 1975 or 1976, Roscommon County Council, without funding from the Department of the Environment, put in the infrastructure to create an area in Monksland which has boomed.  Some 1,000 people are employed in the pharmaceutical industry there.  This is a good news story.<\/p>  <p>  We must examine the area which should be Roscommon's and which was given to Westmeath years ago.  When we look at it now, we see it has been depleted.  Travelling through the area, it is clear it was never looked after by Westmeath.  Some 1,500 people did not just show up at a meeting in Athlone for the craic.  They showed up because everyone in County Roscommon - north, south, east and west - is sick to have even seen what has been proposed.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has it in his gift to scrap this ludicrous situation.  Businesspeople in Monksland have been open about saying they do not and will not support this proposed change.<\/p>  <p>  Who is pushing this agenda?  I know that four parts of Ireland are being examined.  However, this does not make any sense.  Roscommon County Council has spent a great deal of money down through the years putting infrastructure in place.  This is a trophy town and a fabulous example of what can be done in rural areas.  It is a credit to the people who envisaged it down through the years.  Will the Minister make a decision to scrap this proposal.  It does not make sense.  Anyone looking at it would scratch his or her head and ask what is going on here.  Will the Minister call a halt to this proposal before this Government's term finishes?  If a person is doing something that is not right, he or she can stop at any time.  The Minister has it in his gift to call a halt to this proposal before the election.<\/p><p>He can say to forget about it and scrap it because it makes no sense.  Furthermore, in fairness to Deputy Troy and the Westmeath side, they wrote a letter saying that it does not make any sense and they are not supporting it.<\/p> <p> Boxer Moran has made it very clear.  Many public representatives have also made it very clear that they do not support what is going on.  Across the political divide in County Roscommon, everyone is standing shoulder to shoulder with the people.  This cannot go ahead.  There will be uproar.  Can we cut to the chase?  Can we forget about the toing and froing on 27 February, 30 March or whatever date this commission is to come back?  I ask for the Minister to stand up and be counted and for once to  cut what is going on, leave Roscommon to Roscommon and Westmeath to Westmeath and let everyone live happily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100046#TT00600","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453394100,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

I listened to the radio the morning after the public meeting, and a figure of 1,500 people at a meeting shows it is causing grave concern.  I am speaking today on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and will read his reply into the record for the purposes of laying out where the situation is at and who has responsibility in the matter.  I am happy to update the House on the matter and clarify a few points on the Minister's behalf.<\/p>  <p>  As Members are aware, the Minister, Deputy Kelly announced the establishment of statutory committees to review local government boundaries in Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda and Waterford on 19 June last.  In the case of Athlone, the committee has been asked to carry out a review of the boundary between Counties Westmeath and Roscommon and to make recommendations with respect to that boundary that it considers to be necessary in the interests of effective local government.<\/p>  <p>  The main rationale for undertaking the review in Athlone is that the 2011 census shows there is a significant Athlone environs population in County Roscommon.  The question that arises is the appropriate relationship between administrative jurisdictions and the current settlement and development position.  Bringing an entire town within a single local authority area can eliminate or prevent any possible anomalies or distortions of divided administration, service provision, regulatory and enforcement responsibility and electoral representation that might arise.  Potential problems can also be addressed, including differing policies and practices between authorities in respect of matters such as planning, rating and charges, which can impact negatively on town centres.<\/p>  <p>  The Athlone boundary committee has been established under section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991 and, in accordance with subsection (3) of that section, it is independent in the performance of its functions.  While it would be inappropriate, therefore, for me to comment on the substantive matter under examination, I would like to take the opportunity to address briefly some misconceptions that have been reported recently regarding this issue.  First, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is not proposing that the boundary be changed; the task of examining and analysing the issue has been entrusted to the independent boundary committee and it is that group which will consider and report on the matter.  At that stage, it will be open to the Minster of the day to suggest the alteration of a boundary by order, having regard to the boundary committee report.  In this context, I would like to point out that the matter will not be decided finally by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, but by the Oireachtas.  In accordance with the 1991 Act, a draft of any order made by the Minister providing for a boundary alteration must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order cannot be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  This would normally follow a submission to Government.<\/p>  <p>  Feedback thus far suggests that the revised structures and measures implemented by this Government are generally operating well and I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will look forward to studying the various reports, including on counties Westmeath and Roscommon, to assess whether further adjustments are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100047#UU00300","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1453394100,"counter":401,"content":"<p>We talk about joined-up thinking.  For years, this has been a success.  Roscommon has liaised with Westmeath in terms of both councils.  They have worked perfectly together.  Roscommon is well capable of looking after planning and doing whatever thinking has to be done.  It needs to be left in Roscommon's care.<\/p>  <p>  One thing that is mentioned in the reply is different services.  The main medical centre for all of that area is in Monksland and it covers parts of south Roscommon.  What is the Government going to do?  Will it have people from south Roscommon going to Westmeath to get care, and leave out Ballinasloe or Roscommon town?  This is the kind of thing that is going on.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of the day, with all due respect to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, he can talk about independent bodies or whoever he wants.  It is still stated clearly in his reply that while the review body will come back and give its decision, it is for a Minister to decide whether it goes ahead or not.  Those are the simple facts.  The legislation will come through the House but it is for a Minister to decide to bring it in.  The current Minister has it in his gift to turn around and stall the whole thing.  He would be very well placed to do that coming up to an election and he should do so.  <\/p>  <p>  This is not about politics.  Across the political divide, there is one united front in Roscommon.  Everyone is in full support of each other and all are saying this is a ludicrous measure and it must be stopped.

There is a fear of the report recommending the proposed changes and the Minister of the day having a decision to make to bring it to both Houses.  However, at this stage, nothing is proposed.

The devastation caused by the flooding since early December is still widely affecting our communities.  We have seen the destruction of land, business and of so many people's family homes.  Last night, in excess of 100 people gathered in the Bounty in Athlone.  I could see in their faces that they were suffering from physical and mental exhaustion.  I was struck by the frustration they are experiencing, and the heartbreaking stories they shared with me and other public representatives who were there last night.  One woman spoke about getting up in the morning and putting on a pair of waders to wade out to her gate to get on the back of a tractor, for the tractor to bring her down the road where she could get into her car just to do a little shopping.  That is the level of inconvenience that these people have to endure.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Another elderly woman spoke about having to relocate from her house to a hotel and of coming down to breakfast one morning to be told she had to vacate the hotel by check-out at 11 a.m. that day.<\/p> <p> Many of the issues in regard to the community welfare officer and the restrictive nature of the scheme were dealt with by Deputy Dooley this morning with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  I have a real issue with legitimate, tax-compliant businesses being refused access to the Red Cross scheme.  The Egan family business has self-catering chalets which are exempt from commercial rates, and it is not the case they are not paying the rates.  Thomas Cleary, a horse trainer, is also exempt from commercial rates, and there is also the case of Patricia Doyle.  It is not that these people are not meeting their obligations but they have not been able to access the Red Cross funding despite the fact they have legitimate businesses that have been flooded and devastated.<\/p> <p> The sad part is that the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, all came and met each and every one of these people and they promised that the criteria would be changed in order that people could avail of the funding.  It is simply not good enough that, four weeks after the most senior members of the Government visited Athlone, these people still cannot access funding to help them repair the damage that has been caused by the flooding, which is totally outside their control.<\/p> <p> What is in the control of the Government is the eligibility criteria which would give these people the money to which they are entitled.  The community welfare officers need to be given instructions by the Minister responsible, the Minister for Social Protection in order that people who voluntarily took time off work to protect their homes, who have incurred additional expenses through ESB charges and the hiring of pumps, and who had to buy in food and incur additional costs would be supported by the Government.  It is a damning indictment of this Government that Ministers came to Athlone four weeks ago, made promises and, today, those promises have not been honoured.  While I accept it is not the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, I plead with him to speak to the relevant Ministers in order that they can make the necessary amendments and give these people their just entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100047#UU00700","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453394700,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I acknowledge the suffering and hardship many families have endured in recent weeks.  To an extent, we had our own issues in Donegal before Christmas, particularly in the Finn valley area, but the situation was more acute in the midlands.  I acknowledge the considerable hardship many people have gone through.  With regard to the three examples, it is important we know the details, whether that is through myself or the Minister, and we are happy to follow them up.<\/p><p>In the immediate aftermath of Storm Desmond at the beginning of December 2015, the Government approved the allocation of &euro;5 million to be distributed as emergency humanitarian support to small businesses which, through no fault of their own, have been unable to secure flood insurance and had been flooded during the period of 4 December 2015 to 17 December 2015.  Subsequent to the storms which continued into late December and early January, the Government decided to expand the scheme to cover the period of December 2015 to January 2016.  It was also decided to allow community, voluntary and sporting organisations which could not obtain flood insurance and had suffered flood damage to their premises to apply for assistance.<\/p><p>The scheme, which is being administered by the Irish Red Cross Society, provides a once-off <i>ex gratia<\/i>contribution towards the costs of returning business premises to their pre-flood condition, including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock.  It does not cover repairs to football pitches, race tracks or golf courses affected by the floods.  The scheme does not provide a contribution to loss of earnings or loss of business goodwill.  The scheme is not intended to act as a compensation for loss, nor is it intended to provide an alternative to insurance cover.<\/p><p>The emergency nature of the flooding incident required an urgent response to try to make payments to small businesses for business continuity purposes in the run-up to Christmas.  A two-stage approach was agreed by Government.  The first stage provides a contribution of up to &euro;5,000 per property, depending on the scale of damage incurred.  Applications under the &euro;5,000 threshold are being paid following a quick verification process between the Irish Red Cross and the local authority responsible for the area in which the business was flooded.  The second stage of the scheme provides a means to seek further support of up to &euro;20,000 per property.  This involves a lengthier process requiring a detailed assessment of the damage by loss assessors appointed for this purpose by the Irish Red Cross.  The total level of support available for both stages combined is capped at &euro;20,000 per property.  Application forms for the scheme are available on the Irish Red Cross website.<\/p><p>I thank the Irish Red Cross for the work it is doing in ensuring applications are processed and payments are disbursed in a speedy manner.  While the Irish Red Cross is an independent charitable organisation, the allocation of the funds is provided by the Exchequer.  As with any funding provided by the Exchequer, there is a requirement for governance and accountability.  There has to be prudent management and financial controls.  While controls must be in place, the emergency nature of the response requires a system which is not cumbersome or overly bureaucratic.  In the case of small businesses, the controls that have been put in place for payment under the scheme include that the business must have been trading at the time of the flooding incident and that the business must have been operating in a rateable premises.  This allows for the speedy turnaround in the processing of payments as once these details are verified by the relevant local authority and subject to the application form containing full details, the Irish Red Cross can then make a payment to the applicant for an amount up to &euro;5,000.  The Irish Red Cross continues to receive application forms and payments are processed daily.  The charity advises that 122 payments have been made to date.<\/p><p>The Minister for Defence has visited a number of sites affected by flooding in recent weeks and has seen at first hand the difficulties many small businesses have experienced.  In cases of particular hardship, I understand the Minister is open to having the criteria reviewed where exceptional circumstances arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012100048#VV00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1453394700,"counter":407,"content":"<p>With all due respect, we know the schemes that are available.  My point is that the schemes available are too restrictive and legitimate family-run businesses, the backbone of the local economy, are being penalised.  The Minister visited the areas and the Taoiseach came out of hiding after four weeks and visited the areas.  Well done, he did his job.  However, he made a promise when he visited the areas that the people who were not getting funding but who deserved it would get it.  Four weeks on, that has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  All through Christmas, I was in a dry house, thank God.  What must it be like for people who were left with the severe destruction of flooding?  The Government is not providing the assistance they deserve.  I do not want to hear any more about reviews or exceptional needs payments.  These people need help and assistance now.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, needs to say he accepts that the scheme as it was originally set up is too restrictive and that these people will be accommodated.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, needs to say she is instructing the community welfare officers in this regard.  I pay tribute to community welfare officers for the work they are doing but they too are operating under restrictive conditions.<\/p>  <p>  People who gave up their time and took unpaid leave to protect their homes have additional ESB and fuel charges and the cost of the hire of pumps.  These costs must be included.  What we are effectively saying to people is that if they did not protect their houses and let them flood, we would have put them up in the local hotel and given them assistance to repair the houses on their return.  The people who protected their houses should also be compensated.<\/p><p>It is not their fault their houses, businesses and lands were flooded.  It is not their fault they cannot obtain insurance.
