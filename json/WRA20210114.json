Unemployment fell from a high of 15.9% in 2011 to 5.7% at the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Against this back drop of almost full employment, the Government introduced Future Jobs Ireland in 2019, which set out a policy shift away from job numbers towards quality jobs to allow for higher living standards, and sustainable jobs, with a focus on maximising labour market participation. Future Jobs sought to further embed a resilient and innovative economy that was adaptable to future challenges and to foster economically, environmentally and socially sustainable growth. This agenda has been largely subsumed into the forthcoming National Economic Plan (NEP), the Government&rsquo;s new medium-term economic plan to rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s economy in the aftermath of the global Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the  plan will set out a pathway for an inclusive and regionally balanced recovery.

IDA is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) cannot be the sole contributor in addressing the challenges facing Ireland&rsquo;s regions &ndash; from Brexit to Covid-19, digital transformation to the climate transition &ndash; but it can have a significant impact in propelling economic recovery and realising more balanced growth. <\/p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate, innovative and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of multinational corporations that are at the forefront of the modern economy remains essential to winning FDI. IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme ensures the supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations as required by current and prospective clients of both IDA and Enterprise Ireland. A robust property and infrastructure ecosystem can be the key differentiator in winning FDI projects. Over the last 5 years, IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations.<\/p>  <p>  For example, in May 2020 Meissner Filtration Products announced that their new manufacturing facility in Co.

Meissner had initially established in an IDA constructed Advanced Manufacturing Building, completed in late 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing risk aversion, financing challenges and the uncertainty associated with Covid-19 and Brexit are all likely to continue to result in a lack of commercial property solutions in regional locations. The IDA therefore must continue to intervene where market failure exists to ensure that the necessary property and infrastructure solutions are in place to maintain and attract FDI to regions in line with its strategic objectives and regional targets. In addition to its own property solutions, IDA will also continue to work with commercial property developers and Local Authorities to market other property solutions across all regions where they exist.<\/p>  <p>  The locations in which IDA will provide property solutions over the lifetime of its new strategy Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024 were chosen based on extensive analysis, engagement, review and consultation as well as macroeconomic considerations, existing clusters and available resources. IDA will deliver 19 Advanced Building Solutions (ABS) to regional locations and will deliver building solutions in Galway (x2) and Mayo (x1) in the West Region.

Growing travel demand often negates emission mitigation measures and concerns are emerging regarding the slower than anticipated pace of some technological advancements. Despite considerable efforts across all Member States, EU transport emissions are continuing to rise. Urgent, deep and widespread reform is needed as we work towards achieving the European Green Deal ambition of climate neutrality by 2050.

basis.\u00a0 Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.\u00a0 At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>Flexibility has also been introduced to the rates of subsidy and on the 6th of January I announced that the current rates of subsidy provided by the EWSS are to remain in place until 31 March 2021, aligned with the extension of the rates of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). <\/p>  <p>  I am therefore satisfied that the design of the EWSS fully takes account of the changing environment around living with the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021, including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400046#WRC04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400046#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[2075\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400046#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of early years education services in Ireland currently availing of the employment wage subsidy scheme;

In early December 2020, and as the public health restriction at the time began to ease and businesses reopen, Revenue confirmed that the concessionary measure related to employer-provided vehicles would cease to apply on\u00a031 December 2020 and, with effect from 1 January 2021, BIK on same should be calculated in the usual manner. \u00a0<\/p><p>However, since then, Level 5 public health restrictions have been subsequently introduced. On 24 December 2020, all restaurants, caf&eacute;s and gastro pubs as well as personal services, such as hairdressers, beauticians and barbers closed, while hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;amp;Bs remain open but are restricted to essential non-social and non-tourist services only. Additionally, on 31 December all non-essential retail as well as gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools closed. For employees, the public health advice is to work from home in all instances unless work is an essential health, social care or other essential service that cannot be done from home.\u00a0<\/p><p>Having regard to the current public health restrictions, the short-term concessionary measures announced back in March will remain in place.

Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.\u00a0 For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.\u00a0 The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.\u00a0 The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are\u00a0necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.\u00a0 Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.\u00a0 Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an\u00a0application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.\u00a0 Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant\u00a0is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she\u00a0can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400047#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400047#WRD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[2084\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400047#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the main policy initiatives undertaken by his Department since 27 June 2020; and his main priorities for 2021.","asker":"1545","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>Since 27 June 2020, my Department has undertaken a broad range of important policy initiatives, many of which will remain a priority in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The main policy initiatives in 2020 included production of Budget 2021 and publication of Finance Bill 2020, as well as preparation of the July Stimulus Bill.\u00a0 Policy options were developed to improve efficiency of tax administration (amendments to encashment tax and Professional Services Withholding Tax regime) and a feedback statement on the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) Interest Limitation Rule was prepared.

The Recovery and Resilience Facility is the key element of the &euro;750bn Next Generation EU plan agreed by the European Council in July. <\/p>  <p>  In my role as President of the Eurogroup, significant agreement was reached at Eurogroup in November 2020 on progressing reform of the European Stability Mechanism and the early introduction of the Common Backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. Into 2021, delivery on the Eurogroup Work Programme and Euro Summit commitments, in particular a time bound work plan on banking union and discussions on the appropriate fiscal stance, will be amongst my main priorities. <\/p>  <p>  In order to protect jobs and workers in the context of Covid-19, my Department managed Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the European instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) loan scheme.

This work and engagement has sought to ensure that the sector is adequately prepared, and that financial services firms and market participants have contingency plans in place to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that the financial sector is well prepared and resilient enough to manage the changes associated with Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been supporting the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; preparations for the customs checks that are now necessary for goods travelling between Ireland and the UK, excluding Northern Ireland. Notwithstanding that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is now in place, businesses face a significant level of change due to new customs arrangements. Significant resources have been allocated to this, including intensive stakeholder communications and training, staff recruitment and infrastructure enhancements.

It was in this context that Budget 2021 provided &euro;340 million in measures to prepare for Brexit, through the continuation of existing measures and new supports for sectors and enterprises likely to be most affected. This comes on top of over &euro;700 million in successive Budgets since 2017. In addition, the Recovery Fund of &euro;3.4 billion will allow specific, targeted measures to be introduced when and where the need arises in response to both Brexit and Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The EU budget&rsquo;s Brexit Adjustment Reserve allocation to Ireland will complement and enhance the comprehensive supports put in place by Budget 2021. The European Commission published the proposal on 25 December 2020, and my and other Government Departments are continuing to make Ireland&rsquo;s case for substantial funding to support affected sectors known to EU partners.<\/p>  <p>  On the basis that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is now in place, as well as the preparations undertaken in respect of the economy, budgetary strategy and financial services sector, I am satisfied with the steps taken to date to support preparedness and to manage any impact.<\/p>  <p>  One sector in particular which has evolved as a result of Brexit, and which continues to do so, is the international financial services sector, which has seen firms relocating from the UK and firms looking to set up operations in the EU for the first time. The industry in Ireland has become broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time.\u00a0 This follows on from a number of government strategies, the latest iteration of which is &lsquo;Ireland for Finance, that have sought to grow the sector over several decades, and these strategies were in place long before Brexit. The Government and various state agencies continue to work to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland&rsquo;s strengths as a leading specialist financial services centre.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these preparations and evolution within some sectors, given the scale and interconnectedness of Ireland&rsquo;s trading relationship with the UK, Brexit will have a negative impact on our economy but the Government is doing everything possible to manage this.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Joint analyses by my Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) modelling the macroeconomic impact of Brexit were published in 2016 and 2019. The analyses covered a range of outcomes and possible future relationships between the EU and the UK. <\/p>  <p>  The analyses included a limited Free Trade Agreement (FTA) based on zero tariffs and zero quotas on the goods side with very little covered in respect of services. Overall this is broadly in line with the recently concluded new Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU.<\/p>  <p>  Under this Free Trade Agreement scenario, the research found that the level of GDP would be around 2\u00a0 per cent lower over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) and around 3 per cent lower over the long-term (i.e. 10 years), compared to a situation where the UK remained in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the research outlined, Budget 2021 was based on the prudent assumption of a disorderly end to the transition period between the EU and the UK. Under this scenario, a decline in GDP of -2 &frac12; per cent was projected for 2021, with growth of 1 &frac34; per cent expected in 2021. This is around three percentage points below a counterfactual scenario, where a trade deal between the EU and UK is reached.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Updated economic forecasts will be published as part of the Stability Programmer Update in April, and this will take into account the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was reached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400047#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[2157\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400047#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the financial services sector has been affected by Brexit negatively or positively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>My Department has been participating in whole of Government preparations for Brexit since before the UK referendum in 2016 and, in line with the Government&rsquo;s overall approach, this work intensified during 2020 ahead of the end of the transition period.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been working closely with the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), through the Financial Stability Group, and through the Brexit Contact Group, to limit the impact of key identified risks in the Irish financial system and review progress on readiness planning.

The analysis found that the sectors most exposed to both the Covid-19 and &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit shocks appear to be distinct and relatively unconnected. While the analysis was based on the assumption of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit, this general conclusion is still applicable today.<\/p>  <p>  Although the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK provides for zero-tariffs and zero-quotas for qualifying goods, it will nevertheless introduce trade frictions in the form of non-tariff barriers. It is also a considerable &lsquo;step-down&rsquo; in terms of services trade relative to the previous EU-UK relationship, which is significant as Ireland exports considerably more services than goods to the UK. Therefore, while the newly formed agreement protects Irish firms from the more significant impact of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit scenario, they will still be impacted by the change in trading arrangements. Thus, it represents a smaller Brexit shock for a broadly similar sectorial mix of Irish firms as under a no-deal scenario.<\/p>  <p>  Using this analysis, my Department&rsquo;s Budget 2021 forecasts accounted for the dual impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; Brexit on the Irish economy. Crucially, it was assumed that a Covid-19 vaccine would not be widely available before 2022 and that bilateral trade with the UK would take place on WTO terms from January. Under these assumptions, GDP growth of around 1 &frac34; per cent was projected for this year.

These projections were based on the assumptions that a vaccine for Covid-19 would not be widely available before the end of this year and that bilateral trade between Ireland and the UK would take place on WTO terms from January. <\/p>  <p>  However, the public health and economic situation has evolved significantly since the Budget forecasts were published. As it stands, there are both material upside and downside risks to the economic outlook for this year. On the upside, the recent Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK is positive for Irish exporters compared to the &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario upon which the Budget forecasts were based, as it will provide for zero-tariffs and zero-quota trade for qualifying EU and UK goods. However, the Agreement also introduces &lsquo;trade frictions&rsquo; in the form of non-tariff barriers, which will increase trade costs. Therefore, while the agreement protects Irish firms from the more significant impact of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; scenario, they will still be impacted by the change in trading arrangements. An earlier than anticipated rollout of vaccines will also improve the economic outlook for this year. <\/p>  <p>  On the downside, however, the re-introduction of Level 5 restrictions at the beginning of this month will likely have a contractionary effect on the economy.

Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence\u00a0the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;<\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);<\/p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income: growing cost inefficiencies have been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years;<\/p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.\u00a0 The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing\/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.\u00a0 In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.\u00a0 Indeed the Central Bank advises that a\u00a0recent study by it\u00a0estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remain term. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.\u00a0 As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.\u00a0 Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.\u00a0 It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with their lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"House Prices","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[2163\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps that will be taken to ensure that lending policy does not contribute to house price inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[2164\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for regulations that the Central Bank might apply to the lending institutions to encourage them to assist first-time house buyers and to deter profiteering in the housing market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland, as part of its independent mandate to preserve and protect financial stability in Ireland, has statutory responsibility for the regulation of mortgage lending by banks and other regulated entities. In line with this mandate, the Central Bank introduced macroprudential measures for residential mortgage lending in February 2015. The objective of these mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households to reduce the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage measures are now in place as a permanent feature of the market and are operating in line with their stated objectives of enhancing the resilience of banks and borrowers to future shocks and reducing the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing.\u00a0 Subject to certain allowances and exemptions, the mortgage measures set particular loan to value and loan to income limits on residential mortgage lending by regulated entities and, as the Deputy will be aware, the\u00a0loan to value limit for first time buyers is 90 per cent compared to\u00a0 80 per cent for second and subsequent buyers (and 70 per cent for buy to let mortgages).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The mortgage measures are not intended to regulate or directly control the level of house prices per se. However, the 2019 review of the mortgage measures by the Central Bank found that if the measures had not been introduced in 2015, both the level of house prices and the proportion of highly indebted mortgage borrowers would likely have been significantly higher in 2019 than their observed levels, all else being equal. Therefore, as indicated while the objective of the mortgage measures is not to target house prices, this suggests that &ndash; in the absence of the mortgage measures &ndash; affordability pressures for mortgage borrowers would have been even more acute.\u00a0 Furthermore,\u00a0the Central Bank indicated that the latest review of the mortgage measures conducted late last year found that they have continued to meet their objectives over the course of 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE01300"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[2165\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which he expects Covid-19-related payments to continue into the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[2166\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for the continuation of Covid-19-related payments into the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.<\/p>  <p>I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021, including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Such measures as have been put in place to help otherwise viable businesses who continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 are kept under close review especially in light of the introduction of the Level 5 public health restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  One very important measure that continues to be closely monitored is the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).\u00a0 This has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis with over &euro;4.5 billion worth of payments having been made to date via wage subsidies to sustain businesses and help people to manage financially in the midst of these very challenging times.<\/p>  <p>  I have always been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.\u00a0 It is noted that the legislation implementing the measure provides that it will be in place until 31 March 2021, but also provides that the scheme may be extended until the end of June 2021, should it be required.<\/p>  <p>  It is likely that continued support will be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.\u00a0 Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances\u00a0and economic conditions as they become clearer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":211,"content":"<p>Question No. 77 answered with Question No. 71.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE01900"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[2185\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details relating to his Department for outsourcing to consultancies of specific Covid-19-related work, services or advice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy of the following details in response to his question.<\/p><p>The Department of Finance\/ESRI Joint Research Programme is funded by\u00a0my Department\u00a0and the Revenue Commissioners and involves ongoing project collaboration across all three parties in the policy areas of banking, taxation and the economy.

Those recruited from outside the Civil or Public Service will not be made such an offer, but will be covered by paragraph (ii) below.<\/p><p>(ii) If the person is not offered a post as in paragraph (i) above, and has not reached preserved pension age, he\/she may be offered severance of 1 year&rsquo;s salary (or salary to preserved pension age if less), with pension payable on reaching preserved pension age. For those who have reached the applicable minimum pension age, superannuation benefits are payable immediately, with no additional benefits and no severance payment. <\/p><p>(iii)\u00a0Where an alternative appointment is offered, as in paragraph (i) above, but is not accepted, no severance is payable, and pension is payable at the applicable minimum pension age, with no additional pension benefits. Similar arrangements apply where a Secretary General is given an alternative appointment and later retires. <\/p><p>(iv)\u00a0Pension benefits of Secretaries General who are members of the new Single Pension Scheme will be based on career-average rather than final salary, and no enhancements.<\/p><p>The terms that applied to appointments prior to the introduction of revised terms in 2011 are as follows:<\/p><p>(i) Secretaries General may at the end of their term of office be offered an alternative public service post, or a position in an international institution, if the individual is under age 60 on the expiry of their term of office<\/p><p>(ii)\u00a0If no alternative post is offered or if the individual is over 60 on the expiry of their term the following may be \u00a0provided:<\/p><p>- Immediate payment of pension and lump sum, without any actuarial reduction<\/p><p>- Added notional service up to a maximum of 10 years or balance of service to age 65 (subject to a cap) <\/p><p>- Severance payment of 6 months&rsquo; salary.<\/p><p>The pension entitlements for those recruited to these positions depend on a range of factors including career history, pay point, date of entry and age of retirement. The value attaching to these terms also will vary from case to case depending on the specific circumstances applying at each retirement. For example, the pension entitlements of an individual who joined the civil service for the first time after 2013 would be based on membership of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme i.e. career average earnings for the calculation of pension benefits depending on years of service, payable from State Pension Age. An individual with no prior service now joining the civil service on foot of a TLAC competition for the position of Secretary General would similarly become members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  <\/p><p>  \">Tab A<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400048#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":236,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 87 and 88 answered with Question No. 79.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":237,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 85.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":238,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 90 and 91 answered with Question No. 79.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400049#WRF00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400049#WRF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[2032\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400049#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when the live events scheme will open for applications; if festivals that have been rescheduled will be eligible to apply for the scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>An allocation of &euro;50 million was made in Budget 2021 for the live performance\u00a0sector.\u00a0 It is intended that the rollout of the funding would include measures that will build on grant schemes launched under the July stimulus, such as the pilot \"Live Performance Support Scheme\" and the \"Music Industry Stimulus Package\".

My Department has developed strong information flows across Government on global developments which have informed critical decision making. My Department will contribute to economic recovery as we move to the next phase in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a committed member of the European Union and during 2020 my Department has been working with our European colleagues to assist each other during this time of crisis, and as we rebuild our economies.

This month, as we take up our seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 session, we are strongly committed to playing a highly constructive role which is underpinned by our commitment to peacebuilding, human rights, disarmament, sustainable development and supporting a rules-based international environment. <\/p>  <p>  Delivering first class consular and passport services to our citizens will remain an essential priority.

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations<\/p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned shortly. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. <\/p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. <\/p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. <\/p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie\/backtoschool<\/i>. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074\/2020\u00a0 (Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have \u00a0in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.<\/p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. <\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication\u00a0of coursework and that circular is available at <i><\/i>. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. <\/p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.\u00a0 The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.<\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.\u00a0 All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie\/backtoschool.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400050#WRG05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Site Acquisitions","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400050#WRG05500"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[2033\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400050#WRG05600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the purchase of the adjacent field at a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":347,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department \u00a0is working closely under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Department and Local Authorities with Fingal County Council in relation to the acquisition of the land adjoining the school for the purpose of extending the school site.

Specifically the immediate priorities following my appointment related to the reopening of our schools, the provision of a summer programme for those students with special education needs or at risk of disadvantage and also to complete the Leaving Certificate 2020 calculated grades process. Budget 2021 also continues the programme of major reinvestment in our school system with my Department&rsquo;s allocation being &euro;8.9 billion in 2021, an increase of &euro;410 million or some 5 five per cent on 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Government supported the re-opening of schools through the Roadmap for the Full Return to School agreed by Cabinet at the end of July and the provision of a financial support package of &euro;437 million. Almost one million students, 4,000 schools and 100,000 members of staff returned to school in accordance with their normal schedule.<\/p>  <p>  Government has prioritised the continued operation of our schools in a safe and sustainable manner since their return, and Ireland&rsquo;s public health authorities have repeatedly confirmed that our schools are safe environments with very low levels of transmission within schools. <\/p>  <p>  In September, 60,000 students received calculated grades results. <\/p>  <p>  In August, I announced a series of changes to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021, to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. The adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. An advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations.<\/p>  <p>  A significantly expanded Summer Programme 2020 was provided for children with the most complex disabilities. Over 14,000 children participated in the special education summer programmes for children with special educational needs. The programme included a number of strands and options from which parents could choose, involving either in-school, or home-based supports by teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to help to prevent regression among children with SEN. The programme aim supported the child to reintegrate \/ transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers. <\/p>  <p>  In Summer 2020, 215 DEIS primary schools ran literacy and numeracy summer camps in 2020, with over 7,000 pupils attending and 72 DEIS post-primary schools ran the week long summer programme in 2020 with over 2,200 students attending. <\/p>  <p>  Looking forward to delivering on our commitments in 2021, the additional funding in Budget 2021 provides for a lower pupil-teacher ratios and class sizes reducing the primary staffing schedule by one point, to a historically low level of 25:1.<\/p>  <p>  An additional 1,065 teachers will be hired benefiting our primary, post-primary and special schools and this includes assisting primary schools to retain existing teachers. Provision has also been made for 400 additional teachers for students with special educational needs both in mainstream schools and in special schools. There will also be a further significant increase of almost 1,000 additional special needs assistants. These investments will ensure more than 1,200 new places in special classes. <\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;15 million will be invested in the school transport system to provide for growing numbers of school children and the requirements of children with special educational needs.\u00a0 Further supports are being provided as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  This will be supported by additional funding of &euro;2 million in 2021 and &euro;5 million in a full year and will include a 1 point reduction to the Senior Schools Urban Band 1 staffing schedule.<\/p>  <p>  The Government committed to commence a free schoolbooks scheme pilot in September 2020. &euro;1 million has been provided for a new pilot which aims to provide free school books to more than 102 primary schools which are part of the DEIS Programme for the 20\/21 school year. The pilot will run for the period of one year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation.<\/p>  <p>  In total in 2020, &euro;160 million has been provided to schools in Minor Works funding, including &euro;30 million which has been brought forward from 2021.\u00a0Due to the unprecedented Covid-19 situation, exceptional Minor Works Grant funding was also provided to Post Primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides an additional &euro;2m in funding is being provided in 2021 to pay Gaeltacht placement grants for two cohorts of students, due to no placements occurring in 2020 as a result of Covid-19 with a further additional &euro;1m is also being provided for the continued implementation of the Gaeltacht education policy.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to expanding and enhancing the in-school speech and language pilots to improve the delivery of therapies in schools. Budget 2021 has provided additional funding to expand the School Inclusion Model to two more CHO areas. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 investment includes a capital allocation for new and more energy-efficient school buildings with a &euro;740 million budget for 2021 under Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;3.5million has also been committed to continue investment in the Creative Ireland and Music Generation programmes. This will bring the overall funding in this area to over &euro;9 million in 2021. In November last I announced &euro;50 million in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Grants for primary and post-primary schools to support the\u00a0embedding of the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning and to provide for the continuity of teaching and learning using digital technology. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that work is progressing on the full range of commitments in the Programme for Government and further delivery or fulfilment of those commitments is a priority in 2021 and over the term of the Government. \u00a0However, my current clear priority is to work with the education partners to have our schools reopen as soon as possible and to ensure continuity in the education of all students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400051#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400051#WRH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[2116\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400051#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the permanent building for a school (details supplied); if the contract will be awarded as planned and construction commenced in Q1 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>The tender process to establish the new Design &amp;amp; Build Contractors Framework commenced on the 4th December 2019.

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations<\/p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned shortly.The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. <\/p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. <\/p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. <\/p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie\/backtoschool<\/i>. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074\/2020\u00a0 (Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have \u00a0in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.<\/p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. <\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication\u00a0of coursework and that circular is available at <i><\/i>. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. <\/p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.\u00a0 The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.<\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.\u00a0 All documentation published is available on <i>www.gov.ie\/backtoschool.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400051#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400051#WRH03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400051#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[1987\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400051#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on whether sufficient measures are in place to ensure that workers in the private sector working in essential service jobs can self-isolate if required to do so without significant loss of earnings;

The development of the policy is at an advanced stage, informed by an extensive consultation process with a wide range of stakeholders including Government Departments, State Agencies, rural stakeholder groups, young people and the wider public. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department held a series of further discussions with key stakeholders to explore the short and longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural communities and economies and to identify actions required to assist rural areas to recover from the impact of the pandemic.

The new Rural Development Policy is currently progressing through the final stages of approval and I hope to publish it in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also supporting the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe (the Countryside Council) to develop a new National Outdoor Recreation Strategy. This Strategy will provide a vision and overarching framework for the development of outdoor recreation in Ireland over the coming years. The strategy is expected to be brought to Government during 2021. My Department is also undertaking a range of other initiatives to support the further development of the sector, including through a review of the Walks Scheme and the role played by Rural Recreation Officers in delivering outdoor recreation priorities at a local level.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The revitalisation of rural town centres, and progressing measures to encourage increased residential occupancy in rural towns and villages has also been prioritised.

The group will also review the suggested actions from the independent report of the pilot Town Centre First Initiative delivered by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also actively progressing a range of other policy initiatives in support of rural Ireland such as a review of the REDZ scheme and the CL&Aacute;R programme, including the designation of CL&Aacute;R areas.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of community development, progress on the implementation of Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities: A five-year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector in Ireland, will be a priority for 2021 and beyond, while my Department will continue to work with local authorities to support the implementation of the objectives and recommendations of the 2019 review of Local Community Development Committees. In addition, my Department has statutory responsibility to support the development of Local Economic and Community Plans (LECP) and will be prioritising this process in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The National Volunteering Strategy 2021-2025 was published in December 2020 and comprises high-level strategic objectives and associated actions to support volunteers and their representative organisations. It articulates the values and principles that will guide and shape Government&rsquo;s support for volunteers and volunteering activity over the next five years. The implementation of the actions in the strategy will be a key priority for my Department in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Charities (Amendment) Bill has been identified as key priority in the Programme for Government. It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to progress this Bill in 2021 as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  The development of a Government strategy for philanthropy is another key initiative of my Department. Consultants were appointed in 2020 to provide an overarching view of philanthropy in Ireland and of best practice in the EU. This research, to be submitted to my Department in early 2021, will assist development of a strategy on philanthropy in consultation with stakeholders during 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department has continued to deliver the range of policy measures to support the development of social enterprises in Ireland outlined in the National Social Enterprise Policy.\u00a0In 2021, this work will focus on building awareness of social enterprise through the development and implementation of an Awareness Strategy, and on improving data collection on the extent of social enterprise in Ireland. This year I plan to commission a census of social enterprise in Ireland that will address the information gap that exists.\u00a0\u00a0A draft concept paper for conducting a census has been circulated to stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the development and implementation of the above policy measures, further details of the delivery of our supports and programmes in rural Ireland and communities in 2020 will be provided in my Department's Annual Report, to be published later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021011400057#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"}]
