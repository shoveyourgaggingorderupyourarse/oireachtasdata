The circular directs Government Departments and Agencies to consider including environmental criteria in their procurements, where such clearly defined, quantifiable, verifiable and measurable criteria have been developed. These criteria should, if they are relevant to that procurement, be met within a Department&rsquo;s existing budget without impacting on service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  An overarching objective of all public procurement is the achievement of value for money. In implementing environmental considerations in\u00a0public procurement, it is crucial that an approach is adopted that will further Government policy while also ensuring a competitive market place where suppliers can compete resulting in the desired pricing outcome. \u00a0In areas where the market is not yet sufficiently competitive, a phased approach to environmental considerations in\u00a0public procurement may be necessary to encourage the emergence of new suppliers with innovative solutions.

Our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has been engaging on these issues in Colombia, including in La Guajira and has maintained regular contact with all relevant stakeholders in order to gain a greater understanding of the circumstances and issues that have been raised previously with regard to the Cerrej&oacute;n mine. <\/p>  <p>  I remain concerned at reports of the activities of the mine having a detrimental impact on the environment and on local communities.\u00a0Taking into account security and other considerations, a visit by the Embassy to the Department of La Guajira, where the Cerrej&oacute;n mine is located, was possible in late September 2019. The visit took place on 23 and 24 September and was led by Ireland's Ambassador to Colombia, Ms Alison Milton. <\/p>  <p>  The programme included a tour of the mine itself, which was also attended by NGOs and local-community groups, as well as meetings with all stakeholders involved with the Cerrej&oacute;n mine, including Cerrej&oacute;n management, local communities, local government, religious leaders, academics and NGOs, including the local human rights group Fuerzas Mujeres Wayuu. <\/p>  <p>  The La Guajira region has a near-majority indigenous population (over 40% compared to 3.4% nationally), the largest of which is the Wayuu people, who number around 270,000 and for whom the exploitation of La Guajira&rsquo;s natural resources is a major grievance as they maintain a deep spiritual and ancestral connection to the land. It is also one of Colombia&rsquo;s poorest regions, where the needs of local communities are acute. <\/p>  <p>  The mine generates almost half of the region&rsquo;s income and is one of its largest employers providing over 13,000 jobs. While the mine owners attest to their compliance with local and international standards, challenges exist in relation to local governance, leading to a lack of trust between the local authorities, local communities and the mine. <\/p>  <p>  The Embassy has reported on the range and complexity of issues, not least evolving public opinion in relation to the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels, and concluded that efforts should be made to improve communication between the local communities and the mine, and to include the local community in plans for closure of the mine by 2033. <\/p>  <p>  The Embassy will hold meetings with national Government, with national and international NGO partners, and with Cerrej&oacute;n management in order to share feedback on the visit. Some of these meetings have already taken place. <\/p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, I wrote to the ESB in September requesting further information regarding the ESB's sourcing of coal from Cerrej&oacute;n. I received a response in October in which the ESB outlined a recent assessment of the mine carried out by Bettercoal. <\/p>  <p>  Bettercoal is an organisation established by major coal buyers to ensure coal is being sourced via responsible supply chains, which the ESB joined in 2014. This assessment indicates that the Cerrej&oacute;n mine's operating principles are essentially in line with the Bettercoal best practice code. Bettercoal has made a number of recommendations to Cerrej&oacute;n for improvement and increased compliance, on which the mine has been actively engaging.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Addressing the risks of adverse impacts of business activities on human rights is a priority of this Government.

In light of this discussion, it called on the Presidency to submit a Negotiating Box with figures ahead of the European Council in December 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The October\u00a0discussion largely reiterated the differences between Member States on the key issues. There was no narrowing of views on the overall level of expenditure, with a number of net contributors reiterating the need to keep the overall level at 1% of EU GNI, while there was strong push back from the net recipients on the Presidency proposals which they consider too low,\u00a0they\u00a0argue for\u00a0an overall level of\u00a01.11% of EU GNI. On the allocation of volumes between areas, net recipients expressed strong dissatisfaction regarding proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Cohesion which they see as requiring further increases to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, for Cohesion in particular. <\/p>  <p>  Given that Member States did not move beyond their\u00a0traditional positions on the\u00a0above,\u00a0it is not possible to say who would be willing to increase contributions in order to fund CAP under a given scenario. A key element for consideration\u00a0in the upcoming negotiations\u00a0will be the nature of adjustments to the CAP, or any other policy area.\u00a0For instance, all the cuts applied to CAP could be made up without any commensurate increase to contributions, if adjustments are made elsewhere in the MFF.<\/p>  <p>  For Ireland, the CAP remains\u00a0the a key national priority for the negotiations. Expenditure in the area of agriculture helps support 44 million jobs across the EU, while contributing to European Added Value (EAV) through rural sustainability, food safety, animal welfare, and environmental standards.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to contributions, in his intervention at the October European Council, the Taoiseach noted that while Ireland&rsquo;s contribution is likely to increase significantly, we need to\u00a0focus on\u00a0the benefits and not just the costs of EU membership, including access to the Single Market which vastly outweighs EU Budget contributions. While Ireland has not yet finalised a view on the appropriate overall level of expenditure in the next MFF, we support the efforts of the Presidency to progress negotiations towards agreement and will continue to engage constructively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400050#WRC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400050#WRC05300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400050#WRC05200"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[47059\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400050#WRC05300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the funds allocated to Ireland over the 2014 to 2020 period and expended in each year and to date in 2019 between Exchequer and EU funding to the PEACE IV 2014-2020 Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and INTERREG, in tabular form.","asker":"1335","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>The PEACE IV Programme (2014-20) supports peace and reconciliation in the border counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\u00a0 The programme has\u00a0a total funding allocation of &euro;269,610,964, including\u00a0Irish ERDF of &euro;49,551,086 and Irish national match\/exchequer funding of &euro;8,744,309.<\/p><p>The INTERREG VA Programme (2014-20) aims to build social and economic cohesion in the Irish border counties, Northern Ireland and western Scotland, with a total funding allocation of &euro;282,761,995.\u00a0\u00a0This includes &euro;71,230,000 Irish ERDF and &euro;12,570,000 national match\/exchequer funding.<\/p><p>Both programmes are managed by the\u00a0Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB).<\/p><p>Claims for expenditure are paid\u00a0retrospectively, with the SEUPB making the first expenditure claim to the Commission in 2017.\u00a0 The yearly breakdown of expenditure claims paid\u00a0is set out in the following table: <table>    <tr>       <th>Claims Paid by Year<\/th>       <th>PEACE IV Irish ERDF &euro;\u00a0<\/th>       <th>PEACE IV Irish Match\/Exchequer &euro;\u00a0<\/th>       <th>INTERREG VA Irish ERDF &euro;\u00a0<\/th>       <th>INTERREG VA Irish Match\/Exchequer &euro;\u00a0<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017\u00a0<\/td>       <td>414,726<\/td>       <td>73,188<\/td>       <td>656,704<\/td>       <td>115,393<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>2,911,664<\/td>       <td>513,831<\/td>       <td>5,158,657<\/td>       <td>817,346<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>4,155,144<\/td>       <td>733,286<\/td>       <td>7,192,749<\/td>       <td>1,170,041<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400050#WRC05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400050#WRC05500"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[41403\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400050#WRC05600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of public buildings that have been retrofitted;

Total gross expenditure will increase by 5 per cent to just over &euro;70 billion. After taking account of potential expenditure arising from the no-deal Brexit, expenditure in 2020 would rise to over &euro;71 billion. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In 2020, core voted Government expenditure on the delivery of public services, excluding costs relating to the need to respond to a disorderly Brexit will be &euro;61.9 billion.

Targeted and sustainable investment will enable ambitious growth in our regional cities which can complement the continuing importance of Dublin to the national economy.<\/p>  <p>  In order to safeguard this significant investment, a range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. As part of this initiative, the third Public Service Performance Report was published earlier this year and provided outturn performance information for 2018 as well as trend data for the previous two years. My Department also finalised year three of the Spending Review process in 2019. The Spending Review aims to place evidence at the centre of policy development, through the examination of existing policies and programmes to assess their efficiency and effectiveness. This systematic examination of existing expenditure can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Managing the delivery of public services within allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department. There are important measures are in place to ensure that our budgetary targets are being met. My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels.

For the first cycle of equality budgeting, a number of diverse policy areas were selected with associated objectives and indicators published in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018. Progress towards achieving those targets was reported on in the Public Service Performance Report 2017.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high level goals articulated is a matter for the individual spending Departments in the first instance. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate the initiative and provide support for Departments to fulfil the Programme for Government commitment. The Government&rsquo;s performance and equality budgeting programmes are solely concerned with public sector activities; they have no remit in the private sector.<\/p>  <p>  Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. In addition to the six equality objectives identified in the pilot (Phase 1), a further eight objectives were added for 2019 (Phase 2). This means nine Government Departments are now actively engaged with Equality Budgeting. An update in the Public Service Performance Report 2018 outlined progress in the pilot.<\/p>  <p>  To further guide the roll-out of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published on October 8th,\u00a0in tandem with\u00a0Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. This ongoing process is further guided by the work of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group.\u00a0 Once these recommendations have been fully considered by my Department, in conjunction with the Expert Group, I will outline future plans for Equality Budgeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400051#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400051#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[46981\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400051#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the recruitment throughout the public sector in the context of economic recovery to date; the expectation in respect of future recruitments throughout the sector in 2020 and thereafter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware from previous replies, in my role as\u00a0Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have overarching responsibility for workforce planning in, and recruitment to, the Civil Service. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2015,\u00a0it\u00a0was announced that there\u00a0would be a\u00a0targeted programme of recruitment into the Civil Service to address service needs and a shortfall in key skills.\u00a0The Deputy will\u00a0be aware that\u00a0a number of open competitions have already taken place or are in the\u00a0process of taking place for recruitment to the Civil Service.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from the Public Appointments Service, who are the independent recruiter\u00a0for the Civil Service, that since the lifting of the moratorium, approximately\u00a014,600 civil servants from open competitions excluding temporary assignments and professional and technical posts,\u00a0have been assigned to Government departments and offices across general service grades.

The allocations to Ireland under the Erasmus PRO programme are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2018 (Actual allocation)<\/th>       <th>2019 (Estimate allocation)<\/th>       <th>(2020 Projected allocation)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>ErasmusPRO*<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.5M<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.7M <\/td>       <td>&euro;0.8M<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> *Note the figures have been rounded<\/p><p>In 2018, the overall funding (under both calls) allocated to Erasmus+ Key Action 1 VET Mobility was &euro;3.8m; of this, &euro;0.5m was allocated to ErasmusPRO.\u00a0 2019 figures have not been finalised since funding amounts have not yet been confirmed under the second call in October. However, the estimate is that by the end of 2019, the total for both calls will be approx. &euro;5.2m allocated to KA1 VET Mobility, of which approx. &euro;0.7m will be allocated to ErasmusPRO.\u00a0 At present, the projected allocation for Erasmus+ KA1 VET Mobility in 2020 is &euro;5.9m; based on figures in 2018 and 2019, L&eacute;argas would expect approx. &euro;0.8m to be allocated to ErasmusPRO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400051#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400051#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[46908\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400051#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 276 of 5 November 2019, if the additional accommodation will be in place for a school (details supplied) for the commencement of the 2020-2021 school year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[46909\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400051#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 276 of 5 November 2019, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some students have not been offered a place in a school in the area despite applying for each commutable school in the town and surrounding districts; his views on whether this is fair; and his plans to address same.","asker":"1302","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department is in receipt of an application for additional accommodation from the school in question.

It should be noted that there has been an administrative change in 2019 to the allocations for the City of Dublin Youth Services Board (CDYSB), as it had historically managed some projects outside of its area boundary.\u00a0 These allocations have been re-profiled to the local ETB and the change does not affect the allocation to the project themselves. <table>    <tr>       <th>ETB Payments <\/th>       <th>2016 <\/th>       <th>2017 <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>       <th>2019<br \/><br \/>(Allocation)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>City of Dublin ETB (CDYSB)<\/td>       <td>&euro;18,332,037.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;19,485,853.08 <\/td>       <td>&euro;21,221,157.13 <\/td>       <td>&euro;16,696,704.00 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan and Monaghan <\/td>       <td>&euro;262,757.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;995,860.99 <\/td>       <td>&euro;704,697.93 <\/td>       <td>&euro;972,806.20 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,792,118.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;4,021,479.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;3,583,102.38 <\/td>       <td>&euro;3,798,658.25 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal <\/td>       <td>&euro;500,742.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;937,138.94 <\/td>       <td>&euro;566,542.32 <\/td>       <td>&euro;810,526.83 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin and Dun Laoghaire <\/td>       <td>&euro;7,255,402.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;8,118,388.15 <\/td>       <td>&euro;8,446,122.15 <\/td>       <td>&euro;8,865,662.51 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway and Roscommon <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,476,948.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,220,509.63 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,010,433.31 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,510,131.89 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry <\/td>       <td>&euro;380,972.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;602,765.08 <\/td>       <td>&euro;363,527.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;852,417.73 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare and Wicklow <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,226,737.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,726,330.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,512,673.62 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,283,933.17 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny and Carlow <\/td>       <td>&euro;472,420.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;624,254.70 <\/td>       <td>&euro;718,912.59 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,243,458.40 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois and Offaly <\/td>       <td>&euro;141,558.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;311,357.77 <\/td>       <td>&euro;228,516.89 <\/td>       <td>&euro;472,611.01 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick and Clare <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,016,063.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,311,413.27 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,518,942.40 <\/td>       <td>&euro;3,519,250.70 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford and Westmeath <\/td>       <td>&euro;328,014.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;495,082.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;442,769.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;732,960.62 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth and Meath <\/td>       <td>&euro;343,912.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;795,421.92 <\/td>       <td>&euro;485,539.63 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,013,798.35 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo Sligo Leitrim <\/td>       <td>&euro;254,825.70 <\/td>       <td>&euro;694,255.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;472,715.47 <\/td>       <td>&euro;962,669.63 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary <\/td>       <td>&euro;607,285.96 <\/td>       <td>&euro;815,555.73 <\/td>       <td>&euro;792,081.17 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,194,776.22 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford and Wexford <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,333,384.00 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,668,447.54 <\/td>       <td>&euro;1,540,010.53 <\/td>       <td>&euro;3,131,069.93 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>ETB Total <\/td>       <td>&euro;37,725,175.66 <\/td>       <td>&euro;45,824,112.80 <\/td>       <td>&euro;45,607,743.52 <\/td>       <td>&euro;49,061,435.44\u00a0<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400056#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400056#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[46955\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111400056#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children in State care that are the children of mothers who grew up in State care.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to an operational matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

In the context of the scheme&rsquo;s success my Department engaged with\u00a0the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance with regard to the allocation for 2019.<\/p><p>I engaged early as I said I would. While discussions commenced in October 2018 on additional funding,\u00a0the first tranche of &euro;200m was only fully drawn down in\u00a0August of this year. My Department wrote to all 31 local authorities on 15\u00a0August 2019 sanctioning an additional &euro;363 million in funding for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This brings total funding for the\u00a0Loan to over &euro;563 million for 2018 and 2019 combined. <\/p><p>The RIHL is funded by financing provided to the local authorities by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA).\u00a0As an on-balance sheet entity, the HFA's borrowing from\u00a0 the non-Government sector forms part of General Government Debt.\u00a0RIHL loans, however,\u00a0do not impact on the General Government Balance as the RIHL scheme is treated as a loan under the European System of Accounts 2010 framework.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Furthermore, the ESRI have been commissioned to conduct a review of the operation of the RIHL. The output of the review will be used to inform the development of the RIHL product and identify any reforms to be introduced if necessary\u00a0to local authority mortgage lending via the RIHL in 2020 and beyond. <\/p><p>The Housing Agency provides a central support service which assesses applications for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan on behalf of local authorities and makes recommendations to the authorities to approve or refuse applications.

The CRU is required to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of customers of Irish Water. <\/p>  <p>  On this basis, the CRU, informed by a multi-stage public consultation process, published its Decision Paper on Irish Water&rsquo;s Proposed Connection Charging Policy on 18 December 2018 and the policy came into effect on 1 April 2019. The relevant public consultation documentation continues to be publicly available on the CRU&rsquo;s website and the Decision Paper in particular can be accessed at the following weblink -<\/p>  <p>  www.cru.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/CRU18262-CRU-Decision-on-Irish-Waters-Connection-Policy.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  The CRU decision details the reasoning for the charging regime and sets out further actions that the CRU has directed must be taken by Irish Water in response to stakeholder concerns, which include addressing the waiting times faced by customers seeking to obtain a connection quotation.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory functions in relation to this matter have been assigned to Irish Water and the CRU, as outlined above, and I, as Minister do not have any role in determining connection charging policy.<\/p>  <p>  On the broader issue of resources, the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024, which I approved in November 2018 following its consideration by Government, sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic business plan funding requirement of &euro;11bn to 2024, comprised of a &euro;6.1bn investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9bn in operating costs.  This significant multi-billion euro investment Plan will support the continued operation, repair and upgrading of the country&rsquo;s water and wastewater infrastructure to support social and economic development across the State and protection of the water environment.<\/p>  <p>  It may also be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.
