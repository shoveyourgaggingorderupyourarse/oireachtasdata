These have produced dedicated tools, focused research and professional collaboration, which will support staff, augment policy-making and the effective targeting of resources across the sector to achieve the high standards set by the respective student well-being, consent and suicide prevention frameworks.<\/p><p>One such project is the 'Speak Out reporting tool' which was created as part of the implementation of the Framework for Consent, which I launched on 19 October 2021. The tool allows HEIs to understand staff and student experiences of sexual harassment and violence and assists institutions, the HEA and my department in making evidence-based policy decisions in this area. Most importantly, it raises awareness of the supports available to students and staff and encourages them to seek help if they need it.<\/p><p>In late 2020, I launched the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. It recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support them and respond through working proactively. The Framework provides clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties.<\/p><p>The HEA has established a cross-sectoral &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo; working group to support the implementation of the Framework. This group will meet later this month to consider progress on the national framework and will identify examples of good practice for further sharing across the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[6122\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans regarding a further education facility (details supplied); if he proposes to expand the existing site for use by the further education facility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>The new National Development Plan (NDP) provides for a step up in capital funding and a significantly more ambitious phase of capital investment in the FET sector.

My Department will follow up with Cork ETB to clarify if this is still the case and advise the Deputy if there are plans to re-establish painting apprenticeships in Cork at any point in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Technological Universities","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB05800"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[6362\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB05900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the Atlantic technological university is on track to commence operations in 2022; if consideration has been given to locating the headquarters of the new technological university in County Mayo; if further details are available on the plans for the campus in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>The Ministerial order drafted to appoint both the official name and date of  establishment of the Atlantic Technological University has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 3 of the Technological Universities Act 2018 and I will shortly sign this order appointing 1 April 2022 as the date of establishment. <\/p>  <p>  An open public process seeking nominations for the positions of Chairperson and two ordinary members of the first governing body of the new TU has been run by my Department and I am currently considering a number of shortlisted candidates presented to me under this process.<\/p>  <p>  The relevant applicant institutes are currently progressing an open competition to identify and put forward a suitably qualified candidate to myself as Minister for designation as the first president of the TU in accordance with section 56 of the 2018 Act.<\/p>  <p>  Post- establishment the specific roles, plans for and operation of the TU&rsquo;s eight campuses across the West and North West, will be a matter for the governing body of the autonomous higher education institution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB06100"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[6383\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800048#WRB06200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of students from Northern Ireland enrolled in further and higher education in each of the years since 2010 to date in tabular form; his plans to further investigate the mobility of students in the Common Travel Area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1597","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The data sought by the Deputy with regard to further education is detailed in the table below:  <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Enrolments:<\/td>       <td>178<\/td>       <td>300<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> It refers to the period 2018 to 2020.

To date three TUs have been established, Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin), Munster Technological University (MTU) and Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (T&Uacute;S) since 2019. Two more TUs are on the cusp of establishment, namely Atlantic Technological University which will be established, subject to the finalisation of the necessary legislative and administrative procedures, on 1 April 2022 and as recently as 3 February I notified the chairs of the governing bodies of Institute of Technology Carlow and Waterford Institute of Technology that I had made by final decision to grant those applicant institutes an order establishing a technological university in the South East following a rigorous assessment process. The new higher education institution will be known as South East Technological University. Subject to the completion of the requisite legislative and administrative requirements arising from this decision, all parties are working towards an establishment date for the new TU of 1 May 2022, meaning those students graduating from the current applicant institutes will do so with university qualifications.<\/p>  <p>  Upon finalisation of these processes, the higher education landscape will contain two remaining Institutes of Technology namely Dundalk Institute of Technology (DkIT) and Institute of Art, Design and Technology Dun Laoghaire. Both Institutions are receiving Exchequer funding from the TU Transformation Fund to progress on a trajectory towards TU designation. DkIT is also availing of the technical advice and support services of respected Higher Education Authority (HEA) special advisor on higher education policy, Dr. Ruaidhri Neavyn, who continues to assist the Institute as an external expert advisor going forward<\/p>  <p>  However, ultimately it remains a matter for the governing bodies of autonomous Institutes of Technology to decide where they wish to locate themselves within the higher education landscape.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the statutory framework provided in the Technological Universities Act 2018, two or more Institutes of Technology may jointly seek TU designation through a prescribed legislative process. Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by such institutions seeking designation as a TU subject to their jointly meeting specified eligibility criteria.  In addition, section 38 of the 2018 Act provides that an applicant institute and an established technological university may apply to the Minister for an order. The Department understands that the governing body of DkIT is seeking to pursue the latter legislative path at this juncture and in this context the Institute has taken a number of important steps having published its vision last year to become a dynamic, accessible, student-centred campus of a multi-campus regional TU. This marks meaningful progress on the trajectory to achieving TU status, enabling staff, students and wider stakeholders to be assured of the direction of travel.  It is also understood that the Institute has established key TU project groups, including a TUTF Project Steering Group and a TU operational project group. <\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HEA continue to appropriately support DkIT and IADT Dun Laoghaire in progressing towards achieving TU designation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800049#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":110,"content":"<p>Question No. 92 answered with Question No. 86.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Admissions","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800049#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[6384\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800049#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on whether colleges should increase the use of entrance examinations in 2022 for entry for students who have achieved the general requirements for matriculation but who have not attained the required grade in specific subjects, such as leaving certificate mathematics; if the matter has been considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>Higher Education Institutions are autonomous within the meaning of the <i>Universities Act 1997, <\/i>the <i>Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006<\/i>and the <i>Technological Universties Act 2018. <\/i>As such they are entitled to regulate their own administrative and academic affairs, including in relation to minimum entry requirements.<\/p><p>I am aware that some higher education institution hold &quot;second chance&quot; mathematics exams for students who do not attain the required mathematics grade in their Leaving Certificate.

The plan has involved significant consultation with interested stakeholders, including higher education institutions, students, individuals and representatives of priority groups. There was a strong response to the consultation process and a total of 122 submissions were received from a wide range of stakeholders. This approach of the Plan will be rooted strongly in partnership approaches, across Government, institutions and communities.

The PATH fund has a current investment envelope of &euro;42 million over the period 2016 to 2022, across the three strands which are currently supporting access to initial teacher education, enabling the award of bursaries to the most socio economically disadvantaged students and through the Higher Education Access Fund is supporting institutional capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies for increasing access to higher education. <\/p><p>Students in higher education institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The annual Fund of &euro;9.1m provides financial support to students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending college. Students can apply for SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs, medical costs and books\/class materials. It is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification. It is recognised that COVID19 has had a major impact on the financial situation of students and their families.  As part of my Department&rsquo;s response to the issues affecting students arising from the pandemic, I have allocated significantly higher amounts to the Fund over the past two academic years.  In total, &euro;18.2 million was allocated for the 2020\/2021 academic year.  Last week, I announced the allocation of an additional &euro;1.3 million for this year as once off further funding , which brings the allocation for the 2021\/22 academic year to &euro;18.5 million.  In addition &euro;1.9 million has also been allocated in Covid-19 funding to a contingency fund for access services<\/p><p>I am pleased to confirm that &euro;450,000 has been secured in 2022 through the Dormant Accounts Fund for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 on Traveller participation in higher education.<\/p><p>The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. &euro;9.6m is allocated to the Fund annually for both Further and Higher Education.  In January 2021, I approved a number of strategic projects under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. <\/p><p>Persons in the protection process (asylum and subsidiary protection) or leave to remain process are not eligible to access the statutory based SUSI grant scheme. However, the administratively based Student Support Scheme provides supports along similar lines to the SUSI grant scheme and is available to persons in the asylum, subsidiary protection or leave to remain process.  <\/p><p>Efforts will be advanced this year to examine widening the apprenticeship population so that it better resembles the national population. Under the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025<\/i>, an Equity of Access sub-committee will be established under the National Apprenticeship Alliance. The sub-committee will look at ways of reaching under-represented groups, such as those at risk of socio-economic disadvantage, women, single parents, people with disabilities and Travellers. The Alliance is expected to hold its first meeting in early March, and other actions under the Alliance, including the Equity of Access sub-committee will then follow.  <\/p><p>Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals. FET provision is largely free or heavily subsidised, and a number of financial supports may be available to learners to facilitate the participation of individuals who would not otherwise be in a position to take up training. I would encourage people to make an appointment with their local Adult Education Guidance Service (AEGS), available in each Education and Training Boards (ETB) across the country free of charge, to discuss what supports may be available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":174,"content":"<p>Question No. 112 answered with Question No. 105.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Admissions","counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[6385\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the disproportional number of places offered on QQI level 5 pre-nursing courses and the places dedicated to students coming from these routes on level 8 nursing degrees; his plans to rectify the imbalance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":177,"content":"<p>Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies within the meaning of the <i>Universities Act 1997, <\/i>the <i>Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006, <\/i>and the <i>Technological Universities Act 2018. <\/i>As such, they are entitled to determine the number of places offered in a course under any particular entry route, including places for PLC students and it is not within my remit to determine how many such places are offered.

While my Department will continue to be committed to the implementation of the Official Languages Act, it is not within my remit to direct a HEI as to the courses they offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[6372\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his strategy to support students impacted by domestic violence including access to SUSI supports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>The main support available to students is the Student Grant Scheme managed by SUSI. The scheme provides maintenance and fee grant support for qualifying students who meet the criteria regarding means, nationality, residency and progression. In 2020\/21 over 101,000 students applied for grant support with almost 80,000 students assessed as eligible for support. <\/p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for student grant assistance is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI to determine.  <\/p>  <p>  The overall arrangements implemented by SUSI for the administration of student grants seek to accommodate sensitively difficult circumstances affecting applicants which include but are not confined to family estrangement, differing marital circumstances of dependent applicants&rsquo; parents, state and foster care, orphanhood, unaccompanied minor immigrants and exceptional circumstances impacting on a student&rsquo;s attendance on their course. Many of these circumstances are explicitly recognised in the governing legislation and SUSI also recognises them throughout its processes, including from the point of application and has established specific procedures for their sensitive handling throughout.  In assessing the evidence presented, SUSI will have regard to the particular circumstances in each case and the corroborative nature of the evidence available to support the student&rsquo;s grant application.<\/p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she\/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, she\/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the awarding authority.

This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. The SAF is available to assist students who are unable to meet costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education, including:<\/p>  <p>  - books and other class material that are required to enable students to continue and participate in teaching and learning and\/or complete examinations<\/p>  <p>  - rent, heating and lighting bills and other utility bills e.g., mobile phone data plans, that are required to enable students to continue and participate in teaching and learning and\/or complete examinations <\/p>  <p>  - food<\/p>  <p>  - essential travel<\/p>  <p>  - childcare costs<\/p>  <p>  - medical costs<\/p>  <p>  - family difficulties e.g., bereavement <\/p>  <p>  The above list is not exhaustive, eligible costs are decided on a case by case basis by the access office in line with the scheme guidelines. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. The Access Officers work with students to see how they can be supported financially through the Student Assistance Fund in meeting the costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education. As part of the package of COVID19 supports for 2020 and 2021 the level of baseline core funding was doubled by providing an additional &euro;8.1m in each of those two years.  In addition to these increases I announced another additional funding of &euro;1.3 million for the Student Assistance Fund last Thursday as I have listened to the voice of students, who have clearly articulated that COVID and the increased cost of living is having a major impact on the financial situation of students and their families. This additional funding means that a total of &euro;18.5m has been made available to students who find themselves in financial need during the 2021\/2022 academic year. <\/p>  <p>  In addition in 2021, a further &euro;5 million was allocated to the higher education institutions to support student mental health and wellbeing. This funding allocated by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) included &euro;2m delivered through the Recurrent Grant Model to Higher Education Institutions along with an additional &euro;3m secured as part of the 2021 Covid-19 response package. <\/p>  <p>  HEIs were requested to allocate funds towards student-facing services such as:<\/p>  <p>  - Recruitment of additional Student Counsellors;<\/p>  <p>  - Recruitment of additional Assistant Psychologists;<\/p>  <p>  - Head of service posts for those HEIs employing more than 2 FTEs;<\/p>  <p>  - Training of HEI staff to enable them to support and refer students to appropriate services;<\/p>  <p>  - Raising awareness among students of mental health and wellbeing services available, including through student outreach activities;<\/p>  <p>  - Implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework;<\/p>  <p>  - Implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs; Safe, Respectful, Supportive and Positive: Ending Sexual Harassment in Irish Higher Education Institutions.<\/p>  <p>  HEIs were advised that the funding allocations were additional and intended to enhance rather than displace existing provision of student supports in the areas of mental health and wellbeing.

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of persons on low income and those with special and additional needs. <\/p>  <p>  A range of supports and measures are in place for students attending higher education including for learners with low income and with disabilities; some of these supports are targeted while others are available to the general student population.  <\/p>  <p>  The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  <\/p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for student grants are reviewed annually by the Department and approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. All proposals made in relation to education expenditure, including student grants, are considered in the context of the annual Budget.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I have secured an additional &euro;15m to enhance the existing financial supports under the Student Grant Scheme for implementation in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  For the academic year 2022\/23 this will mean:-<\/p>  <p>  - An increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant. There are currently circa 62,000 SUSI grant recipients receiving maintenance support. <\/p>  <p>  - The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant has been increased by &euro;1,000. <\/p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022\/23 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  I have prioritised these changes for the 2022\/23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students building on the improvements that have already been made for postgraduate students through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme. These improvements to the student grant scheme have been a priority for me since taking up my Ministerial appointment.<\/p>  <p>  I am also happy to give an update on the review of the Student Grant Scheme.  This was a very important commitment in the Programme for Government, which will help shape decision-making on how we support students over the years to come. The draft report was submitted to me in late December 2021.  Given the inter-connectivity between strategic student support issues and other reform priorities (e.g. the expansion of supports to part-time and blended learners as an enabler of lifelong learning or enhanced postgraduate supports as an enabler to equality, diversity and inclusion in the R&amp;I system), it is now my intention to bring the report to Cabinet shortly alongside the Future Funding Model report. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to state the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP) set targets to increase participation in higher education by people with disabilities. Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities. The original (8%) and revised target (12%) under the National Access Plan of new entrants to higher education with disabilities has now been exceeded, with 12.2% of new entrants to higher education in 2019\/20 declaring a disability.However, we acknowledge more needs to be done. Work on the development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is currently underway. One-to-one stakeholder meetings around the specific target groups to be supported for the period of the next NAP have almost concluded. Colleagues in my Department are working closely with the HEA on the development of the new Plan with the intention of publishing the plan in early 2022. An additional &euro;5million has been set aside for this plan.  <\/p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. &euro;9.6m is allocated to the Fund annually for both Further and Higher Education.  In 2019\/2020, circa 16,000 students were supported through the fund.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2021, I approved a number of strategic projects under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 24 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.8m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review. We want to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, and to look at how we can assist people to access and progress through higher and further education and training <\/p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The Student Assistance Fund is a critical support which is allocated by my Department to higher education institutions. The fund has a dual focus. It is designed to support students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with ongoing needs for financial support. It also to provide emergency financial assistance for other students. Students can apply for supports from this fund through their Access Office.<\/p>  <p>  The funding for the Student Assistance Fund pre-Covid was &euro;9.1 million per annum.  This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups under the National Access Plan. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. From the start of the pandemic, I have listened to the perspectives of students and their families who have told me of the significant impact which the pandemic has had on the financial situation of many learners.That is why, as part of my Department&rsquo;s response to the issues affecting students arising from the pandemic, I have allocated significantly higher amounts to the Fund over the past two academic years.  In total, &euro;18.2 million was allocated for the 2020\/2021 academic year.  Last week, I announced the allocation of an additional &euro;1.3 million once off further funding for this year, which brings the allocation for the 2021\/22 academic year to &euro;18.5 million.  In addition &euro;1.9 million has also been allocated in Covid-19 funding to a contingency fund for access services.<\/p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector has progressed a series of actions to support the goal of Fostering Inclusion through the development and roll-out of a series of good practice guidelines to promote inclusion throughout FET, including for learners with a disability. This includes the development of a conceptual framework for Universal Design for Learning (UDL) for the FET Sector, which aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners of diverse backgrounds and abilities, and the publication of the report on &lsquo;Guidelines on Inclusion of People with Intellectual Disabilities in Adult Literacy Service&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Further Education and Training (FET) is fully committed to building inclusive teaching and learning environments. It offers every individual, regardless of any previous level of education, a pathway to take them as far as they want to go, including third level. FET is reaching diverse communities and providing inclusive education and training and continuously strives to be as accessible as possible for all, whereby each individual is given the best opportunity to succeed.<\/p>  <p>  The Mitigating Against Educational Disadvantage Fund (MAEDF) aims to provide funding to support educationally disadvantage learners in accessing and participating in community education. The fund was first made available in 2020 with &euro;5.8m granted comprising over 500 community education projects funded through the 16 Education and Training Boards. In light of the great successes of the MAEDF in 2020, and in recognition of the continuing challenges in relation to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, a further &euro;6.85 million was granted under this Fund again in 2021, comprising over 1,000 initiatives. The projects funded varied from projects to help support online learning, connect communities and providing social supports to the most disadvantaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[6073\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will report on the work to increase the number of female apprentices as part of the national Action Plan on Apprenticeship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[6107\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800050#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department is pursing specific strategies to increase the number of women undertaking apprenticeship courses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 506 together.<\/p><p>One of the five overarching objectives of the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025<\/i>is &quot;Apprenticeship for All&quot;. In other words, ensuring that the profile of the apprenticeship population more closely reflects the profile of the general population. By December 2021, there were a total of 1,535 female apprentices, up from 60 in 2016 and only 665 at the end of 2019.<\/p><p>This increase is mainly due to the expansion of apprenticeship into new areas. Many of these new programmes are in occupations that have greater gender balance in the workplace such as financial services where 52% of participants are female across the four apprenticeships in the sector. Women also feature more strongly in the new apprenticeships in the hospitality, healthcare, property, sales, biopharma and ICT sectors. However, it is also important to note that female representation in craft apprenticeship has doubled in the last two and a half years.<\/p><p>The Action Plan contains a number of key deliverables designed to secure significantly greater diversity by:-  <\/p><p>- including the voice of under-represented cohorts in apprenticeship; <\/p><p>- putting in place an inclusive apprenticeship access and delivery structure; and <\/p><p>- monitoring and assessing targets and developing appropriate interventions.<\/p><p>A bursary of &euro;2,666 is paid by SOLAS to employers of female apprentices in one of the 25 craft apprenticeships to encourage them to employ female apprentices.

As part of this landmark change, a freephone helpline has been introduced for learners, parents and guidance counsellors to provide information on apprenticeship, including how to find an employer. The helpline supplements the existing guidance counsellor service at post-primary and further education and training levels. <\/p><p>There has also been a specific focus on female participation as part of the Generation Apprenticeship national promotional campaign.

With regard to Building Skills, the range of upskilling and reskilling opportunities have been broadened through Skills to Advance, focussed on upskilling for those in employment, and Skills to Compete, a key SOLAS initiative to support those who have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19 to re-enter the workforce.  eCollege has also been expanded and eCollege courses have been temporarily made available free of charge as additional supports to those impacted by Covid-19.Since 2020 there has been over 11,500 learners availing of Skills to Advance and over 13,000 learners have availed of Skills to Compete.Very significantly, the new Action Plan for Apprenticeships was launched last year with a target of 10,000 new apprentices registering every year by 2025.

The fund has a dual focus. It is designed to support students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with ongoing needs for financial support and also to provide emergency financial assistance for other students. Students can apply for supports from this fund through their Access Office.<\/p>  <p>  The core funding for the Student Assistance Fund pre-Covid is &euro;9.1 million per annum.  This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups under the National Access Plan. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. <\/p>  <p>  From the start of the pandemic, I have listened to the perspectives of students and their families who have told me of the significant impact which the pandemic has had on the financial situation of many learners.<\/p>  <p>  That is why, as part of my Department&rsquo;s response to the issues affecting students arising from the pandemic, I have allocated significantly higher amounts to the Fund over the past two academic years.  In total, &euro;18.2 million was allocated for the 2020\/2021 academic year.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week, I announced the allocation of an additional &euro;1.3 million of once off further funding for this year, which brings the allocation for the 2021\/22 academic year to &euro;18.5 million.  In addition &euro;1.9 million has also been allocated in Covid-19 funding to a contingency fund for access services.<\/p>  <p>  This increased funding allocation has assisted more students who have found themselves in the situation of being unable to meet the costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education.  It has helped students in paying bills, buying food, books and other classroom materials and has assisted students with the costs of childcare as they return to campus.  It has supported people remaining in higher education who otherwise would have been under too much financial pressure to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The core funding allocation to the Student Assistant Fund for the 2022\/23 academic year is &euro;9.1 million. This funding will be allocated to institutions in Quarter 3 of 2022, so the breakdown of funding per institution will not be known until then. <\/p>  <p>  However, currently the standard allocation model that is used to calculate each (HEIs) Student Assistance Fund core allocation is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - 40% is based on the number of Full Time Equivalent students in the HEI.  <\/p>  <p>  - 60% based on Deprivation Index Scores (DIS) data. Where DIS data is not available, the sectoral average is used. <\/p>  <p>  The changes I announced in Budget 2022 which will come into effect for the 2022\/2023 academic year have introduced measures to address the cost of living. These measures include a &euro;200 increase to all maintenance grants, increasing certain income thresholds by &euro;1000 and reducing the qualifying distance criteria for the non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant from 45km to 30km which will significantly increase the maintenance grant rate for students, who were previously entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant, due to the distance between their place of residence and their college falling between 30km and 45km.<\/p>  <p>  These changes will mean that more students will be entitled to receive a SUSI grant and that this grant will be worth more to students.

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs.  <\/p>  <p>  The vision of the Third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP) is that the student body entering, participating in, and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups.  Those groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time\/flexible learners, further education and training award holders; and Irish Travellers. The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities. Improving equity of access to higher education is an ongoing objective. The NAP identified a number of indicators that help to inform progress on NAP implementation and the delivery of increased equity of access.  These include entry to higher education from students who have attended DEIS schools, students in receipt of the special rate of grant and data based on postcodes.   At the commencement of the NAP there were 3,959 new entrants to higher education from DEIS schools. This data is recorded through the HEA Student Record System (SRS).  As we develop the new National Access Plan 2022-2026, which is currently underway, and continue to gather data on this particular group, a notable increase is evident in 2020\/21, with 5,320 new entrants from DEIS schools attending higher education. This finding is in line with a Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills  (2021) report which noted an increase in the transition rates of those attending DEIS schools to higher education in 2020.  We will continue to measure entry to higher education for those attending DEIS schools over the lifetime of the new Plan.<\/p>  <p>  DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Initiative is the most significant national (and centrally funded) initiative that targets support at disadvantaged communities, particularly those located in urban areas, the Departments work collaboratively to support successful educational transitions to further and higher education. Early intervention and early educational experiences are crucial &ndash; Access to further and higher education starts early, and earlier inclusive experiences of students in education is crucial influencing factor.<\/p>  <p>  Engagement with DEIS schools also features in Strand 3 of the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH). PATH 3 supports HEI capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies (including with DEIS schools) for increasing access to higher education by specified groups. A number of projects approved under PATH 3, including under the recent extension of a funding for another three years, include engagement with local DEIS schools. <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, a number of projects supported under Strand 1 of PATH, which is committed to increasing the diversity of initial teacher education for new entrants, involve engagement with DEIS schools. For example, several Centres collaborate with DEIS schools in mentoring programmes to improve the reach of access to higher education and in particular, access to initial teacher education. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the PATH 2 bursaries now with three tiers of support take a wider range of indicators into consideration and students from DEIS schools can feature among the recipients.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to seven Special Disadvantage Initiatives located in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in Dublin and Limerick cities. These projects specifically target children and young people in primary and post primary DEIS schools who are generally at risk of not reaching their full academic potential. They also seek to direct further targeted activities at children and young people who demonstrate high academic potential but may be at risk of not progressing to further or higher education for a variety of reasons. <\/p>  <p>  The Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) Supporting DEIS Learners Transition to FET Steering Group was established in 2018 at policy?development?level under ETBI structures to support collaboration amongst ETBs, continually improve practice and, develop draft proposals, policies, procedures, information and resources in areas of supporting DEIS learners transition to Further Education &amp;amp; Training (FET). Since 2018, the Group has supported the establishment of local networks providing information and clear pathways for DEIS learners transition to FET, mapped existing local initiatives to support the Transition of DEIS Learners to FET and shared best practice, developed   a community of shared practice, facilitating learning and development and enhancing capacity within the membership and has established a communication channel facilitating the exchange of information between ETBI, ETBs, JMB and ACCS.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the new National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is at an advanced stage.

Officials in my Department are progressing this in consultation with other relevant Departments and agencies.   In November 2021, the Government agreed a number of measures to enhance the security of electronic communications, including 5G networks. As part of the initiatives, the Government held a consultation on the Electronic Communications Security Measures (ECSMs), which are a detailed set of technical and organisational measures that providers of public electronic communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services will be required to implement.

I propose to take Question Nos. 205\u00a0 and 206\u00a0 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Questions refer to premises located in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map which is available on my Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie. The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate people&rsquo;s frustration when they are living close to a fibre network, owned by a commercial operator, but cannot obtain a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 31 January2022, almost 296,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and over 54,500 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties.\u00a0 In County Westmeath pre-works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Athlone and Delvin and main works are underway in the Deployment Area of Mullingar, with almost 9,000 premises surveyed to date, almost 6,000 premises under construction and over 1,000 premises now available to pre-order.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 31 January, 469 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Clonkill Hurling Club (approx. 5.7km from the premises at Fennor and 7km from the premises at Williamstown), Castledaly Community Centre, Streete Parish Park &amp;amp; Community Hall, Whitehall Community Centre, Milltown Emper Community Centre and Ballycomoyle GAA Club.

The scheme is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits of which are chargeable to tax under Case 1 of Schedule D, from a business premises that is subject to restrictions, set out in the relevant legislation, that prohibit or considerably restrict customer access. <\/p>  <p>  From 20 December 2021, the Government introduced certain restrictive measures for businesses within the hospitality and indoor entertainment sectors. As part of these measures, an 8pm closing time has been imposed from 20 December 2021 to 22 January 2022. Businesses operating within these sectors, who would ordinarily operate evening and night-time trading hours, were considered to be significantly restricted from operating for the purposes of the CRSS and were eligible for support under the scheme where they meet the eligibility conditions.  The Government also agreed that the turnover reduction criteria will be increased from no more that 25% of 2019 turnover to no more that 40% of 2019 turnover.  Revenue has published revised CRSS guidelines, on its website reflecting the latest Government decisions.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or by public health guidance generally in force. The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation provides businesses with the entitlement to appeal Revenue&rsquo;s decision on CRSS eligibility to the independent Tax Appeals Commission (TAC), where they dispute the interpretation applied.  If a business wishes to appeal Revenue&rsquo;s decision that it is not entitled to the CRSS, it should do so within 30 days of the refusal notification.  <\/p>  <p>  The CRSS is just one of the Government supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses not falling within the scope of the CRSS may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). EWSS is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, as announced on 9 December, it was decided that the enhanced rates of support which were due to end on 30 November 2021 would be extended for a further two months until end-January 2022. On 21 December, it was decided on foot of the restrictions I have outlined above, that the EWSS would reopen for certain businesses who would otherwise not be eligible for the support. Businesses that previously registered for EWSS and received a payment in compliance with the scheme have the opportunity to re-qualify for the scheme where they meet certain conditions. Broadly, the business must experience a 30% reduction in turnover, or customer orders during a particular reference period and have tax clearance.  <\/p>  <p>  It is my intention that the legislative aspects associated with the revised arrangements for CRSS and EWSS, outlined above, will be addressed by primary legislation in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the Revenue Commissioners are operating the revised arrangements on an administrative basis pending the legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  The correspondence referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy is noted.  As the Deputy is aware the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for administering CRSS in accordance with the relevant legislation.

This process is an important part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s work to protect consumers and investors, and to ensure the proper functioning of the financial system. <\/p>  <p>  The Payment Services Directive (PSD) and the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) established common rules in relation to certain types of electronic payments, such as credit transfers, direct debits, card payments, and mobile and online payments and therefore allows for authorisation of different firms types in this sector. The main business models of these firms are; Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs), Payment Institutions (PIs), Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) and Payment Institution Service Providers (PISPs). There has been a 138% increase in applications processed and authorised in this sector since the legislation came into effect in 2018.<\/p>  <p>   In 2020, the Central Bank authorised 8 such firms, the breakdown of which is below: <\/p>  <p>  - 5 EMI's <\/p>  <p>  - 2 PI's <\/p>  <p>  - 1 AISP <\/p>  <p>  In 2021, the Central Bank authorised 3* firms under PSD2, the breakdown of which is as follows: <\/p>  <p>  - 2 PI's <\/p>  <p>  - 1 AISP <\/p>  <p>  *Other firms reached an advanced stage of the authorisation process but, ultimately chose not to take up the licence. <\/p>  <p>  For applicants applying for authorisation under PSD2, the Central Bank commits to a 90-day assessment service standard in providing an authorisation outcome. The assessment period will be stopped and restarted where the firm does not provide the necessary information to perform the assessment or do not meet the authorisation requirements as set out in PSD2 and relevant European Banking Authority Guidelines. Therefore, the average length of time for the assessment is driven by the firm&rsquo;s ability to meet the regulatory expectations, which are published on our website. <\/p>  <p>  To date the Central Bank has experienced a varied timeframe to reach authorisation decisions. The timeframe is heavily influenced by the scale and complexity of the business model a firm is attempting to operationalise as well as its level of preparedness and the quality of its engagement with the Central Bank. In a number of cases, the Central Bank have experienced firms continuing to evolve their business model within the live authorisation assessment, which makes the assessment process longer, but which represents a firm using its discretion to change its proposed business model in line with its own business objectives.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank provides feedback to ensure that all firms are clear on their authorisation status and their pathway through the authorisation process. The authorisation framework is designed to encourage early and frequent engagement in order to support firms in their preparations for authorisation and operate an effective and efficient authorisation assessment. <\/p>  <p>  The authorisation process is an iterative process. It includes stages which enable firms to approach the Central Bank at the preliminary (or speculative) phase to gain information and guidance about the process. This is particularly the case in new and emerging sectors where applicants may be less informed as it allows them to understand what is required to be granted authorisation and to take the necessary steps to prepare an application that could meet approval. <\/p>  <p>  The most productive engagements arise from firms who are well prepared for such pre-application exchanges. The standards applied by the Central Bank are also a reason why firms continue to apply to be authorised in Ireland as they demonstrate credibility and trustworthiness.<\/p>  <p>  There is an onus on firms to submit rigorous and credible applications to allow a proper and timely assessment to take place Where there are deficiencies in certain areas, or ambiguity around the proposed business, it can take time for the firm and its advisors to furnish information or to put in place measures which brings them in line with the expected standards. <\/p>  <p>  As the financial services sector continues to evolve at rapid pace, the Central Bank anticipates a continuing increase in authorisation applications, including from innovation in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland's new Strategy is designed to ensure it can meet the challenges of a changing world and deliver on its mission and vision.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to resourcing for authorisations, I would highlight the strategy includes that the Central Bank&rsquo;s leaders and the Central Bank Commission will assess and regularly review the status of, and resources deployed to deliver, the Central Bank's strategic objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800056#WRK03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[6198\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800056#WRK03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of virtual asset service provider licences that have been authorised by the Central Bank in 2021; if his attention has been drawn to the delay by Ireland in implementing the procedures to process these licences; if this is hindering Ireland&rsquo;s objectives under the Ireland for Finance strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>Ireland transposed the fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive into Irish law by way of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021, and the provisions of the 2021 Act that relate to Virtual Asset Service Providers commenced on 23 April 2021. <\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is important to note that Virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs do not require a licence in Ireland.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  <\/p>  <p>  There are, however, certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a Central Bank regulated mortgage lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provides that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on regulated lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.  <\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender. Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for a mortgage or the drawn down of a mortgage, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800056#WRK05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800056#WRK05700"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[6529\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800056#WRK05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the last time a departmental tax expenditure evaluation was conducted on the research and development tax credit in accordance with the guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The arrangements involved are set out in the following Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) Circulars:<\/p><p>- Circular 11\/2015: Protocols for the Transfer and Sharing of State Property Assets<\/p><p>- Circular 17\/2016: Policy for Property Acquisition and for Disposal of Surplus Property<\/p><p>As a matter of policy, no property or site is disposed of until there is absolute certainty that there is no alternative State use for that property.<\/p><p>The OPW&rsquo;s approach to managing vacant properties is firstly, to establish if the property is required for alternative State use, including the potential for it to be re-purposed for either Government Departments or the wider public service. A number of strategic properties or sites are retained in anticipation of potential State use\/development in line with service demands arising from Government policy changes to public service provision.<\/p><p>Secondly, if no State use is identified, the OPW considers if open market disposal is an option, depending on prevailing market conditions.<\/p><p>Thirdly, the OPW may consider community involvement, subject to a detailed submission that demonstrates that the community or voluntary group seeking to use the property has the means to insure, maintain and manage it in order to reduce costs to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that there are currently 68 vacant surplus buildings and 31 surplus sites in its ownership.  Of the 68 vacant surplus buildings, over half of these are former Garda stations that closed under the 2012\/2013 policing plans of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p><p>As of February 2022, there are 36 former Garda station buildings closed under the 2012 and 2013 Policing Plans that are under consideration for alternative State use, disposal or community use.  Of the remainder of non-operational or vacant buildings listed in the Appendix, and sites, a number are in the process of being transferred to Local Authorities, being considered\/prepared for disposal, are under consideration for community use or are being retained for alternative State use. <\/p><p>During 2022, subject to pandemic restrictions, there are four auctions planned with further auctions planned for 2023.<\/p><p>The current status of <b>surplus and vacant buildings (68) and sites (31) <\/b>is in Appendix 1 attached.<\/p><p>There are no vacant leased properties on which the OPW pays rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800057#WRL04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800057#WRL04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800057#WRL04100"},{"type":"question","counter":642,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[5941\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800057#WRL04200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her Department provides funding to sports clubs that are engaged in providing activities for persons with disabilities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":643,"content":"<p>Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards, including the allocation of funding across its various programmes. <\/p><p>I have referred the Deputy's Question to Sport Ireland for direct reply.

Among other things, the Bill will establish a new Media Commission in place of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, provide for the appointment of an Online Safety Commissioner, and establish a regulatory framework for online safety.<\/p>  <p>  The Online Safety Commissioner will oversee the regulatory framework for online safety and ensure, through binding online safety codes, that relevant designated online services, including certain social media platforms, are operating systems and processes which effectively minimise the spread of some of the most serious forms of harmful online content.<\/p>  <p>  While the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas, I have established an expert group on an individual complaints mechanism to examine some of the complex practical and legal issues associated with the establishment of such a mechanism. This follows the important work of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media which, as part of its pre-legislative scrutiny report on the General Scheme of the Bill, included recommendations for provision of an individual complaints mechanism for harmful online content. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of providing for avenues of redress in terms of individual pieces of content in the online world is complex. The approach in the development of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill to date has been to provide the Online Safety Commissioner with the power to require that regulated online services have effective complaints mechanisms in place with powers of audit and investigation provided to the Commissioner in that respect. The Bill also provides for a super complaints mechanism whereby nominated bodies may notify the Commissioner of concerns regarding a designated online service&rsquo;s compliance with an online safety code, or of concerns relating to the availability of harmful online content on a service.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism raises a number of complex practical and legal issues, including in terms of the sheer volume of content online, that Ireland will be regulating a number of services on an EU-wide basis, and questions relating to due process requirements and how quickly decisions could reasonably be made by the Online Safety Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the first meeting of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism on 31 January 2022, and look forward to receiving their recommendations, within 90 days, for how best to address these difficult issues.

Where it is not possible or appropriate, because of the particular circumstances of an appeal, to determine an appeal within the 18 week period the Board is required to notify the participants in the appeal before the expiration of that period giving the reason for not meeting the objective target and specifying a date before which the Board intends to determine the appeal.

Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:<\/p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,<\/p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,<\/p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,<\/p><p>- routine maintenance\/refurbishment or remediation,<\/p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.<\/p><p>6.

AHBs also include housing co-operatives, which are housing organisations controlled by their members\/tenants who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. <\/p>  <p>  AHBs can access a range of funding streams to assist with the delivery of social housing, made available by my Department, through local authorities, for example the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) with a Payment and Availability Agreement (P&amp;A) or the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS). The Capital Loan Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) was closed to new applications in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The terms and conditions, including nomination rights and rent setting, of these funding schemes are set out in my Department's Memorandum on Capital Funding Schemes for the Provision of Rental Accommodation by Approved Housing Bodies (Voluntary and Co - Operative Rental Housing): VHU: 2\/02 of May 2002 and related circulars, and the relevant mortgage, loan agreements and Payment and Availability Agreements in force between the relevant local authority and AHB.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 amended section 3 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 so that dwellings let by AHBs to social housing tenants now come within the remit of the Act. The position of these tenants is significantly improved by the change, which commenced on 7 April 2016, as they now benefit from the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Increased security of tenure;<\/p>  <p>  - Access to Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) dispute resolution procedures, including free mediation; and<\/p>  <p>  - Binding obligations on AHBs as landlords to, inter alia, register all tenancies, keep dwellings in good repair and allow peaceful occupation.  <\/p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced the Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising fastest  do not apply to AHB tenancies. However, three new sections were inserted into the 2004 Act by the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 provide for the setting of rents and rent reviews in AHB tenancies. They are:<\/p>  <p>  - Section 19A provides for the setting of rent in AHB tenancies;<\/p>  <p>  - Section 20A provides for reviews of rent in AHB tenancies; and<\/p>  <p>  - Section 22A provides for the notification of a change in the amount of rent following a review under section 20A.<\/p>  <p>  Section 78(1)(b) of the 2004 Act provides that a dispute may  be referred to the Board regarding the amount that ought to be initially set (in compliance with section 19 or 19A) as the amount of rent under a tenancy. Section 78(1)(c) provides that a dispute may be referred as to the amount of rent that should be determined on foot of a review referred to in Part 3. These provisions mean that an AHB tenant may refer a dispute regarding the setting or review of rent to the RTB for resolution. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority (AHBRA) was formally established on 1 February 2021. A number of key provisions were commenced throughout 2021 to allow AHBRA to work towards becoming operational. AHBRA have developed draft standards, including those relating to tenancy management, which will require that AHBs have fair and transparent rent policies in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800059#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":758,"content":"<p>Question No. 311 answered with Question No. 310.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800059#WRN02800"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[6252\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800059#WRN02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a housing body (details supplied) and its complex at Ballinteer was provided with funding streams by the State which would allow it to set rents for tenants that are not governed by the differential rent setting used by the local authority or to clarify the method of rent setting that is used; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>The development at Woodpark, Ballinteer known as St Anne's was funded through the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS); this funding supports priority areas such as age-friendly housing, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and housing for people with a disability. <\/p><p>The CAS Scheme at St Anne's was built to provide accommodation for older people.

The comprehensive changes include:<\/p>  <p>  - The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1-5.<\/p>  <p>  - The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000. <\/p>  <p>  - The grant calculation methodology in respect of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot with grant costings to be set by my Department following receipt of information on up to date construction costs from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes. In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate grant rate for blockwork removal and replacement following receipt of advice from SCSI. The SCSI will be completely independent in their engagement with my Department on construction costs.<\/p>  <p>  - A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and  local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home. <\/p>  <p>  - Alternative accommodation  and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000.<\/p>  <p>  - In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a  second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if  blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work  subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS;465 standard.<\/p>  <p>  - A new independent appeals process will be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 will be available for esssential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the  remediation option used.

Housing for All includes eighteen distinct actions on homelessness. Two of these actions relate specifically to the provision of supports for families and children and in enabling their exit from homelessness. There is a commitment to enhance family support and prevention and early intervention services for children and their families through a multi-agency and coordinated response, and the dissemination of innovative practice. There is also a commitment to identify and provide enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to families experiencing long-term homelessness to help them exit from homelessness and maintain their homes. These actions are being delivered with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at the local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, with additional supports, including the provision of family supports, provided to families by Tusla.<\/p><p>Local authorities are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as such, applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. Lone parents are entitled to access all of the housing support delivery mechanisms on an equal basis with all other citizens.<\/p><p>However, the Government is determined to ensure that housing policy addresses the needs of those who experience social exclusion in our society by taking firm action. <i>Housing for All<\/i>contains a specific commitment to a Fresh Start principle which will be of assistance to lone parents who may wish to apply for affordable housing or a local authority home loan. <\/p><p>The increases in family homelessness seen in recent months are a serious concern for my Department and for the Government.

This is the highest volume of monthly applications ever received and indicates that there is pent-up demand for passports following the relaxation of necessary travel restrictions due to the Covid pandemic. The Passport Service estimates that up to 1.7 million passport applications will be received this year. <\/p><p>The Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals were issued within one business day. <\/p><p>While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. Figures show that there are currently 76,000 (53%) applications that are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. There are also 67,000 applications (47%) in the system where the Passport Service is waiting for the customer to complete the application. In these cases, the onus is on the customer to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.<\/p><p>The current passport processing times are:<\/p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p><p>- 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p><p>The processing times for a standard online renewal passport applications compare very favourably to processing times internationally in countries such as the UK, United States, Canada and Australia. <\/p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications, the processing time is 40 working days.<\/p><p>My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems. <\/p><p>My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 by the end of March. This represents a doubling of staff numbers over the course of 9 months.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service:  <\/p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications.  <\/p><p>- The Passport Service is actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. <\/p><p>- A new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. <\/p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service. Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p><p>The Passport Service Customer Service Hub officers respond to customer queries by phone and webchat as well as with enquiries related to Emergency Passport cases. The Customer Service Hub handled over 175,000 enquiries in 2021 and is handling over 5,000 customer contacts each week. During times of high demand, there can be delays in getting through to a service agent due to the volumes of enquiries. The Passport Service  webchat is also operational and customers should refresh the page if the icon is grey. A webchat operator is available when the icon is green. I am confident that the recruitment of additional staff, along with significant training initiatives, will have a positive impact on our response to customer service demand.<\/p><p>The Passport Service operates three passport printing machines, two of which are located in the main production facility in Balbriggan and the third in the Passport Office in Lower Mount Street, Dublin. Passport applications from citizens residing in Ireland or elsewhere in the world are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices. All passport applications are processed through the centralised automated passport service system. All production facilities can print a passport, irrespective of the channel through which the application is processed. The printing system allows for flexibility between printing machines if any one machine has reached capacity. Each passport printer has a printing capacity of 250 passports per hour. I am satisfied that the printing capacity of production equipment currently employed by the Passport Service is sufficient to meet the current and anticipated future demand for passports. There are no plans at this time to commission additional passport production equipment.<\/p><p>The Passport Offices in Mount St, Dublin 2 and in Cork offer an Urgent Appointment Service for the renewal of passports. This service was launched in Dublin on 27th September 2021 and in Cork on 26th October 2021. The Urgent Appointment Service ensures that, for those who unexpectedly require a very urgent turnaround of a passport renewal, there is an option available that is transparent, predictable and clear. It means that an applicant can book and pay for their appointment, safe in the knowledge that they will have their passport within a day, or a few days. To avail of the Urgent Appointment Service for Passport Renewal, applicants must first book an appointment to attend the public office in Dublin or Cork. Applicants can book an appointment through the Department of Foreign Affairs website (www.dfa.ie\/passports). <\/p><p>The Urgent Appointment Service replaced the Rapid Renewal Service and customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin or in 4 days in Cork.<\/p><p>Over 2,500 citizens who required an urgent appointment have been accommodated by the passport offices in Dublin and Cork since they re-opened. Last week, the Passport Service has increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 appointments per week.<\/p><p>The Travel Emergency service remains available to citizens in cases of medical emergency or death of a family member abroad. <\/p><p>The current turnaround time for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service is 8 weeks. Proposed turnaround times for 2022 aim to reduce this turnaround time. Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online Service is four times quicker than paper-based applications for adult and child renewal applications and is the fastest, easiest and safest way to apply for a passport. Over 90% of applicants now apply online compared to 47% of applications received online in 2019.<\/p><p>Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.<\/p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800061#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":885,"content":"<p>Question No. 355 answered with Question No. 354.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":886,"content":"<p>Question No. 356 answered with Question No. 354.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":887,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800061#WRP03200"},{"type":"question","counter":888,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[6003\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800061#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); the actions his Department has taken in relation to this case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":889,"content":"<p>Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels.<\/p><p>I note with concern the details in the case referred to by the Deputy.

Ireland by post; and the additional resources he has and will provide to clear these backlogs.","asker":"1489","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":910,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 and 367 together.<\/p><p>The tables below outline the numbers of first time and renewal applications on hand with the Passport Service. Table 1 details the number of complete and incomplete online and postal first time applications that are with the Passport Service. Table 2 details the number of postal or Passport Express renewal applications. Both tables outline how many applications are complete and being processed by the Passport Service and how many are incomplete and require additional action by the applicant. This may include the submission of witnessed child identity and consent forms or documents such as birth certificates. These applications cannot be processed by the Passport Service until the required documents are received. <\/p><p>While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. In January the Passport Service received over 137,000 applications.  Figures show that there are currently 76,000 (53%) applications that are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. There are also 67,000 applications (47%) in the system which the Passport Service is waiting for the customer to complete the application.<\/p><p>The current passport processing times are:<\/p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p><p>- 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p><p>The Passport Service is facing its busiest year to date with an estimated 1.7 million passport applications expected.  This volume of passport applications represents a significant increase from the previous high number of applications in 2019 when 935,000 passports were issued. My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet this level of demand and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.<\/p><p>My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 by the end of March. This represents a doubling of staff numbers over the course of 9 months.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service: <\/p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications. <\/p><p>- The Passport Service is actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. <\/p><p>- A new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. <\/p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service. Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p><p>We are confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.  <\/p><p><b>Table 1 - Domestic first time applications<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Application Type <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Online <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Passport Express <\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Domestic First time applications <\/td>       <td>34,946<\/td>       <td>9,161 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Incomplete domestic first time applications <\/td>       <td>16,431 <\/td>       <td>2,673 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Complete domestic first time applications <\/td>       <td>18,515 <\/td>       <td>6,488 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>Table 2 - Domestic postal renewal (Passport Express) applications <\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Application Type <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Number of applications <\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Complete Passport Express renewal applications <\/td>       <td>6,209 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Incomplete Passport Express renewal applications <\/td>       <td>1,320 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800061#WRP05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":911,"content":"<p>Question No. 367 answered with Question No. 366.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":912,"content":"<p>Question No. 368 answered with Question No. 365.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[6222\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800061#WRP05900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department has procured new buildings to house the new Irish Consulate General Offices in Lyon, Miami and Toronto.","asker":"1489","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>The decision to open new Consulates General in Lyon, Miami and Toronto was taken as part of the Government's Global Ireland initiative to double the scope and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint to 2025.

Given the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK and the long pause in the service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 32,000 applications for which documentation has been received, and which are awaiting processing.

I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. <\/p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government , I announced on 1st February the decision: to operate an examinations  approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021.

The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs. The policy advice was considered by the Department and it was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills. <\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p>  <p>  Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) play a huge role in helping to ensure the inclusion of pupils with significant care needs in education and in school life.  This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  A core recommendation of the NCSE review concerned a change in the way that SNAs are allocated to mainstream classes in both primary and post primary schools and called for the greater proportion of SNAs in these classes to be allocated on the basis of an educational profile of each school before the commencement of the school year in a similar manner to the allocation of special education teachers (SETs).<\/p>  <p>  The new frontloaded model for allocating SNA posts is intended to ensure that SNA support is available immediately to students upon their arrival, reducing delays in accessing support.<\/p>  <p>  Frontloading SNA support eliminates the need for an individual assessment for each student, ending the link with the requirement for a formal diagnosis to gain access to support, and will reduce the delays in making supports available to schools. <\/p>  <p>  This enables a school to allocate SNA support to a pupils without a formal diagnosed special educational need, but who need support. <\/p>  <p>  It had been planned that the frontloaded model of allocation for SNAs would be rolled out to all schools from the commencement of the 2020\/21 school year.  However, in light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools has been deferred to the beginning of the 2022\/23 school year. <\/p>  <p>  In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021\/22 school year:  <\/p>  <p>  - Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021\/22 school year. No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021. <\/p>  <p>  - Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021\/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  <\/p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process. <\/p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie\/for-schools<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually.

The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;<\/p><p>This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. The times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year. The use of these hours forms part of a review agreed under the Building Momentum national agreement due to take place this year.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector specifically requires that SNAs are required to work the month of June on examinations and work appropriate to the grade including training. This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005. This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.<\/p><p>It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June. The utilisation of this period is not specifically for examinations or training purposes only, although these are two of the purposes for which the period of work can be utilised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800064#WRS05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1096,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[6417\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800064#WRS05600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the additional 72 hours that all special needs assistants are expected to work each year under the Croke Park Agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1488","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1097,"content":"<p>As part of the agreement between my Department, the relevant unions and school management boards of a standard contract for all SNA's in 2005, all SNAs have been required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term, not exceeding 12 days in total. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.

However, point 9 of Appendix 1 of this circular does provide possible examples (not an exhaustive listing) of the type of work that may be undertaken by SNA&rsquo;s within their '72 hours' obligations.

This work is ongoing within my Department, and in the interim I would like to point out that there is already considerable provision in schools in the area of healthy lifestyles.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department works together with the Department of Health and other agencies to support students in area of health. My Department acknowledges the commitment of schools in promoting healthy lifestyle choices for students in a number of ways - the curriculum &ndash; for example Physical Education and Social Personal Health Education (SPHE); through schools policy including healthy lunch policies and by the use of resources and programmes chosen by the school. The Active School Flag (ASF) is one such programme. Work by my Department in this area aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge to enable them to make the right choices for healthy lifestyles throughout their lives.<\/p>  <p>  My Department supports Agri Aware&rsquo;s Incredible Edibles programme, a healthy eating initiative for Primary School pupils. The programme is also supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Health. It encourages schools across the country to grow carrots, lettuce, potatoes, strawberries, turnips and herbs. Schools are supplied with grow packs, activity sheets and videos containing everything needed to grow these foods.<\/p>  <p>  The Food Dudes Programme is a healthy eating programme developed to encourage children to eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. It is implemented in primary schools and is based on repeated tastings of fruit and vegetables supported by positive role modelling and rewards. The Food Dudes Programme is currently being implemented in Ireland under an EU six-year strategy framework covering the period 1 August 2017-July 2023.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout school, our young people are educated about the dangers of eating food which is unhealthy during their primary and second level education. The SPHE programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle. The programme is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services, which provide training and advice for schools, and also a resource directory.<\/p>  <p>  At primary level, one of the SPHE strand units 'Taking care of my body' specifically addresses the need for regular exercise and activity as well as the area of nutrition and food and the need for a balanced diet. This unit is built upon from Infant classes onwards. By Fifth and Sixth classes, children are encouraged to realise and accept responsibility for making wise food choices and for adopting a healthy, balanced diet, and in that, exploring and examining the food pyramid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800065#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments","counter":1111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800065#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1112,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[6512\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800065#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 159 of 1 February 2022, the details of the geographical information system which anticipates school place demand for Cork city and county; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1113,"content":"<p>As outlined to the Deputy previously, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System (GIS), using data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.<\/p>  <p>  The GIS is an important management information tool to assist in the planning and monitoring of capital projects at a local and national level.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent analysis undertaken by my Department projects that over 76% of the 314 school planning areas at primary level have stable or decreasing projected enrolments for the period to 2025, whereas some 88% of the school planning areas at post-primary level are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2028, with most expected to reach a peak in the next two or three years.<\/p>  <p>  The level of demand volume across school planning areas with an increasing net requirement ranges from small to medium increases that are likely to be accommodated by existing schools through to significant projected growth that may require additional provision.<\/p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools. <\/p>  <p>  The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review in the context of available information on population, enrolments, existing school capacity and residential development activity.

The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:<\/p><p>- build core social and emotional skills and competencies<\/p><p>- experience supportive relationships<i><\/i>within the school setting<\/p><p>- be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe<i>,<\/i>in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported<\/p><p>Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.<\/p><p>Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available.<\/p><p>A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided by the Department&rsquo;s support services to schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.<\/p><p>Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) which is mandatory in primary schools and up to Junior Cycle provides specific opportunities to enable a young person to understand himself or herself, to develop healthy relationships and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist.<\/p><p>NEPS, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.<\/p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children\/young people with social\/emotional\/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include:<\/p><p>- FRIENDS<b>:<\/b>Training teachers in the delivery of the FRIENDS programmes (&lsquo;Fun Friends&rsquo;, &lsquo;Friends for Life&rsquo; and &lsquo;My Friends Youth&rsquo;), which are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety.<\/p><p>- The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence. Since Covid-19 the training has been adapted to online format which increases accessibility for teachers.<\/p><p>NEPS has developed a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs.<\/p><p>Post primary schools have recently received a copy of new Student Support Team Guidelines.  A Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams.<\/p><p>Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.<\/p><p>NEPS psychologists have also developed a range of resources and supports for our Leaving Cert students, for parents\/guardians and for school staff to support wellbeing and help to manage any stress and anxiety at this time.<\/p><p>While the Department of Health has responsibility for mental health services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. <\/p><p>The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The Commission&rsquo;s Terms of Reference included consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependents can be accommodated within the State pension system.<\/p><p>The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved.  The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on it's website. <\/p><p>The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard.  It also recommended that long-term carers (defined as caring for more than 20 years) should be given access to the State Pension (Contributory) by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution history arising from that caring. <\/p><p>The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  That Committee published its views on 2nd February and I and my officials will include these in our deliberations over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system.<\/p><p>In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and are consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work and get those views before reaching conclusions.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  <\/p><p>The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland. It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers, including those who are only starting their careers.  <\/p><p>The Covid Recognition Payment as confirmed by the Minister for Health has been ringfenced to certain workers ordinarily onsite in COVID-19-exposed healthcare environments.  This payment is a matter for the Minister for Health and is not under the responsibility of my Department.<\/p><p>In so far as my role as Minister for Social Protection is concerned, I have done my utmost to support the invaluable role played by carers in our society.  <\/p><p>My Department provides a comprehensive package of carer's income supports including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.  <\/p><p>Despite the extra financial demands due to the Covid-19 crisis, I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant by &euro;150 to a rate of &euro;1,850.  This is the highest rate since its introduction.  In Budget 2022, I introduced a range of measures benefitting family carers directly, including: <\/p><p>- &euro;5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments, effective since January,<\/p><p>- &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over and &euro;2 for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payments,<\/p><p>- &euro;5 increase in the Fuel Allowance from &euro;28 to &euro;33 per week, from 12 October 2021,<\/p><p>- An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse or partner, and<\/p><p>- An increase in the Capital\/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. <\/p><p>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the commitment and the key role carers play in society and the particular challenges they have faced in light of Covid-19 and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800066#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800066#WRU02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1200,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[6541\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800066#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on the difficulties faced by disabled artists trying to access social protection payments and the basic income for artists; if her attention has been drawn to the implications that this payment will have on social protection payments already received by disabled artists, in particular on the fact that while the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media will not means test the basic income for the arts payment, the Department of Social Protection will take the basic income for the arts payment into account for means tested disability payments and as the proposed basic income for the arts payment is &euro;325 per week, this will exceed the income threshold for primary supports and therefore disabled artist will lose their primary supports if they avail of the basic income for the arts scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1201,"content":"<p>The Arts and Culture Taskforce recommended the introduction of a pilot basic income scheme for artists.

This was supplemented with a series of dedicated meetings with stakeholder groups to discuss the proposed legislation.  In June 2021, I had a meeting with mothers, with key items of discussion covering terminology, their right of access and right to rectification under the GDPR, and the release of medical information. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have also engaged in an intensive consultation process with individuals affected by illegal birth registration.

I have also ensured that key updates on the Bill have been communicated to the hundreds of individuals registered with my Department to receive updates in this area. These individuals regularly correspond with my Department via email, and the number of participants registered on the mailing list continues to grow. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has consulted with the Data Protection Commission, the Ombudsman for Children and has regular, intensive engagement with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla Adoption Services, both through the Birth Information and Tracing Implementation Group and more generally.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has also asked about my engagement with church representatives and I can confirm that I held a positive meeting with representatives of the Catholic Church in Ireland specifically in relation to the provisions of the Bill.

The concept of Baby Boxes has been implemented in a number of countries including Scotland, whereby parents receive a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood.

The guidelines also require that any licence should include a term that the use of facility\/portion of site covered by the licence must cease should it be required for school provision. <\/p>  <p>  Capital investment in early learning and childcare will be delivered through the National Development Plan (NDP)  during 2021-2030.  Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars : Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:<\/p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  (2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p>  <p>  In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department oversees a Case Management process through which local City and County Childcare committees and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care and school age childcare services experiencing difficulties. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800067#WRV03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1270,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800067#WRV03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1271,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[6527\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800067#WRV03400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the date or timeline for financial payments and a form of enhanced medical card for eligible applicants to be made available and to be in place for the mother and baby institutions payment scheme being agreed by Government and published on 16 November 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1272,"content":"<p>I am acutely aware of the sense of urgency in relation to the establishment of the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme.

It met 21 times and has now completed its work.<\/p><p>The report of the Expert Group, , was published on 7 December 2021 following consideration by Government and acceptance of its 25 recommendations. Work has now commenced on implementation of these recommendations. The report of the Expert Group is available here: .<\/p><p>The new funding model outlined in <i>Partnership for the Public Good<\/i>comprises four key elements: two new elements (Core Funding and Tackling Disadvantage funding) and two elements which are developments on the existing funding approaches of the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and the National Childcare Scheme.<\/p><p>The vision of the Expert Group as articulated in the report is for a sector that is &quot;increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall&quot;.  The report envisages a substantially increased role for the State in a range of areas, including fee management, capacity planning, provision of information to parents, planning the development of the sector, supporting services, and managing centre closures. The report also recommends that the Minister should mandate the Department to examine, in the medium term, whether an element of public provision should be introduced alongside private provision. <\/p><p>Taken together, these recommendations reflect a key theme of the report, which is the importance of strengthened State involvement in the running of the sector, in conjunction with increased State funding. This is underpinned by a cultural shift to a partnership relationship between providers and the State that reflects the public good dimension of ELC and SAC.<\/p><p>Announcements in Budget 2022 signaled the commitment to the first stage of implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations. In particular, Budget 2022 allocated &euro;69 million to a new Core Funding stream, equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year.  Full implementation of all recommendations will be progressed in the coming years as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process.  Progress on the implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations will be reported in the context of the Annual Implementation Report for the <i>First 5<\/i>whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800067#WRV03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1277,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[6606\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800067#WRV04000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some childcare providers were forced to close for two additional weeks in 2022 due to staffing shortages and rising costs, and yet parents must still pay the full fee even though they have no childcare for this period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1278,"content":"<p>My Department contracts with early learning and childcare (ELC) services to provide ELC and provides a range of subsidy schemes which partly or totally cover the cost of the ELC provided to families.

In the Construction Sector, registrations grew 38% from 4,377 in 2020 to 7,095 in 2021. <\/p><p>Partly attributing to the success of the growth in apprenticeships is the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme. The Scheme was established to ensure that apprenticeship plays a key part in supporting economic recovery following COVID-19.

First of all, it is treated as an income disregard. This means that it is not included in the income considered for the student grant. Furthermore, unlike other social protection payments which are paid to individuals, the Working Family Payment is a payment deemed to be paid to a family. In recognition of this, the Student Grant Scheme contains provisions which allow this payment to be recognised for the purposes of meeting the eligibility criteria for the special rate of grant, which is the highest maintenance grant support available. This ensures that those students most in need receive supports which are commensurate with their needs. As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for all applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. Creating a difference of treatment in respect of different cohorts of student within the scheme by allowing them to automatically qualify for a student grant would be a significant risk to a statutory scheme which relies heavily on consistency and equity for all applicants. More widely, as the Deputy will be aware, as part of this year&rsquo;s Budget I made the first substantial changes to the rates and thresholds for the Student Grant Scheme in a decade. The draft report of the review of the Student Grant Scheme was submitted to me in late December 2021.

It is, of course, also critical that graduates acquire technical and transversal skills, and that our talent pipeline meets these dual and complementary needs. We know that in a dynamic economy and labour market there will be skills gaps. The imperative is to ensure that our skills forecasting and delivery system is proactive in assessing and responding to the existing and emerging skills needs in our economy and society. My Department&rsquo;s skills policies continue to be developed taking account of &lsquo;mega-trends&rsquo; impacting on labour demand including digitalisation, automation and climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinned by the framework of the National Skills Strategy 2016-2025, a core principle of skills policy development in Ireland is partnership with enterprise and other key stakeholders. This is achieved through a range of partnership platforms, which foster engagement, dialogue, and collaboration between relevant Government Departments and agencies, the education and training system, the enterprise agencies, and private sector representatives. <\/p>  <p>  The development of skills policy and responses to skills needs is evidence based and informed by the work of the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SOLAS) and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in relation to the supply of and demand for occupational skills. The SLMRU also provides an analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s online job vacancies (at occupational level) and difficult-to-fill job vacancies in their National Skills Bulletin each year. In addition, the EGFSN undertakes research and horizon scanning on medium to longer term skills demand across specific occupations or sectors, as informed by Government or specific sectoral strategies. <\/p>  <p>  Specific projections for the number of higher education graduates are not currently produced, as a number of variables can impact graduate output in any one year. However, projections of full-time enrolments in higher education predict that enrolments will rise by at least 8% over the next five years, and work is ongoing to build capacity within the system to accommodate this increase. The number of students graduating from higher education courses each year has increased from 64,246 in 2015 to 81,461 in 2020, an increase of more than 25% in five years.<\/p>  <p>  Further Education and Training (FET) provides a continuum of learning opportunities for around 200,000 unique learners each year from Levels 1 to Level 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), and it provides an opportunity for everyone to engage in learning whilst delivering on the critical skills needs of the economy and the future world of work. FET provision includes labour market focused programmes, and these programmes are available on both a full and part-time basis including evenings and weekends, to suit the lives of learners of all ages and from all backgrounds. The FET system performance framework also sets out targets specifically in relation to supporting jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The mainstream supply of graduates is supplemented with more targeted initiatives designed to meet specific skills needs of employers.  Key national targeted initiatives across the tertiary system include Springboard+, the Human Capital Initiative, Skills to Advance and Skills to Compete. The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations.<\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, the OECD Skills Strategy Project, which I launched in November, will greatly assist my Department in its examination of our National Skills Strategy and approach - in order to ensure that we have a solid foundation on which to build Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and support economic and social sustainability into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800069#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1389,"content":"<p>Question No. 532 answered with Question No. 531.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1390,"content":"<p>Question No. 533 answered with Question No. 531.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1391,"content":"<p>Question No. 534 answered with Question No. 531.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1392,"content":"<p>Question No. 535 answered with Question No. 531.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1393,"content":"<p>Question No. 536 answered with Question No. 531.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1394,"content":"<p>Question No. 537 answered with Question No. 531.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1395,"content":"<p>Question No. 538 answered with Question No. 531.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1396,"content":"<p>Question No. 539 answered with Question No. 531.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in Educational Institutions","counter":1397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800069#WRX02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1398,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[6758\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800069#WRX02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which his Department continues to monitor incidents of bullying in the workplace throughout the higher education system; the extent to which action has been taken or is proposed to deal with such issues in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1399,"content":"<p>Our higher education institutions have a duty of care to their students and staff, and a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours, which act as barriers to their safety and their active participation in college life.<\/p><p>As part of the <i>Framework for Consent<\/i>, institutions must report incidents of Bullying, Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and Sexual Assault to the Higher Education Authority.

The surveys, conducted by the Higher Education Authority, were sent by higher education institutions directly to all students and staff in higher education. A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings. My Department is now working with the expert Advisory Group established by the HEA, to consider the recommendations from these reports and to determine how best to respond to the survey findings. <\/p><p>As for bullying, this act of aggression and dominance cuts to the very bone of the victim and, like cases of sexual violence and harassment, can have profound impacts on an individual&rsquo;s life, livelihood, relationship and participation in the community. <\/p><p>It must be our collective aim to work together in partnership to build a society, culture and institutions where these behaviours are not tolerated. To protect victims and ensure accountability,<i><\/i>we must: <\/p><p>- Prevent - through information and awareness raising especially on matters such as consent; <\/p><p>- Reduce - through structures, procedures and policies that severely limit the potential occurrence of sexual harassment and bullying; and <\/p><p>- Support &ndash; by ensuring that each and every victim of sexual harassment and bullying is given the right supports and space to heal. <\/p><p>I&rsquo;ve written to our higher education institutions advising them that two surveys will be conducted in relation to bullying among staff and students. These surveys are being conducted by researchers at the DCU National Anti-Bullying Centre. <\/p><p>The aim of the surveys is to gain a deeper understanding into the experiences of bullying among and between Higher Education staff and students in Ireland, including the current prevalence, nature and effects of these issues. This will provide an evidence base to inform policy in the area. <\/p><p>The survey on bullying amongst staff in Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) was carried out in 2021. The DCU National Anti-Bullying Centre is currently in the process of analysing the survey findings with a view to publishing the survey report in late spring.

While flashing is a term we are all familiar with, the concept of cyberflashing is relatively new.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, a number of offences already on the statute book which criminalise behaviours that can be described as cyberflashing. The existing offence for flashing, contained in section 45(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2017 is not restricted to physical places and would also apply in the online context.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it is an offence under section 45(3) of that Act to intentionally engage in offensive conduct of a sexual nature. &ldquo;Offensive conduct of a sexual nature&rdquo; means any behaviour of a sexual nature which, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to cause fear, distress or alarm to any person who is, or might reasonably be expected to be, aware of any such behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  A person convicted of an offence under either of these provisions would be liable on summary conviction to a fine or up to six months imprisonment, or on indictment for up to two years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  If such images are sent by phone or text message it may constitute an offence under Section 13(1)(a) of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 (as amended by the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007) which makes it an offence to send by telephone (including by text message) any message that is grossly offensive, or is indecent, obscene or menacing.<\/p>  <p>  Coco&rsquo;s Law, otherwise known as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, contains an offence of distributing, publishing, or sending a grossly offensive communication with intent to cause harm.  Under this offence, harm is caused by seriously interfering with a person&rsquo;s peace and privacy or by causing alarm or distress to the person.  The penalty for such a conviction can be an unlimited fine or up to two years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above offences, persistent cyberflashing may amount to harassment within the meaning of section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. <\/p>  <p>  An amendment introduced by the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 broadens the scope of the offence of harassment to include persistent communication about a person, sometime referred to as indirect harassment. It also increases the maximum penalty for harassment from 7 years&rsquo; to 10 years&rsquo; to reflect the harm caused by the most serious forms of harassment.<\/p>  <p>  The new legislation is intentionally silent about the types of technology that may be used to commit the offences so as to cover all forms of online and offline communications that cause harm to a victim.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is important to acknowledge the work of my colleague, Minister Catherine Martin, T.D., who has recently published and initiated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.

Such content will include certain criminal material, including a number of relevant offences from the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 and the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800069#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1404,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800069#WRX02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1405,"qnumday":543,"qnumall":"[5816\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800069#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a visa application by a person (details supplied) will be examined; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1406,"content":"<p>The citizenship application of the person referred to by the Deputy was approved.

Fear of harassment and violence should never be normalised and nobody should have to think about it as they go about their daily life. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour. This forum is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposals for new ways forward, including whether new powers for Garda&iacute; and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders are needed. Members of the Forum, which I chair, include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Government Departments, community groups, business community members and NGOs. <\/p><p>The Forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counteract the negative impact of ASB on community morale and quality of life. This has included two subgroups established to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.<\/p><p>The knife crime subgroup are assessing available evidence to inform policy on knife crime, with particular reference to effectiveness of proposals, to inform both legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices. The work of this subgroup is ongoing and is expected to conclude in Q1 2022.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place in Ireland with respect to knife crime, including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned. Indeed, the maximum penalty in the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years in an amendment introduced via the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.<\/p><p>Legislative responses alone will not provide a ready solution and evidence from other jurisdictions indicate that simply adopting harsher penalties will not lead to a reduction in the incidence of these crimes. Our existing five year sentence for knife possession is longer than in the UK, for example, where a four year penalty applies. It is important to note that there are no quick-fix solutions, based on international experience, and longer term, evidence-based strategies are needed.<\/p><p>We will continue to examine all possible options as part of the work of the sub-group, including those undertaken in other jurisdictions, and do our utmost to ensure that our communities are, and feel, safe.<\/p><p>To that end I would appeal to anyone who believes that carrying or using any form of weapon, be it a knife, or even a fist, to stop and think of the lasting damage and consequences of those decisions. Even if you believe that you are protecting yourself, the lasting impact of an assault is felt long after the blow is struck. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, combatting all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV) is a priority for this Government. This is reflected in budget allocations and in the development of our policy and legislation. <\/p><p>Minister McEntee is leading work on a new whole of government DSGBV strategy which will be the most ambitious to date. It will be structured around the four pillars of Prevention, Protection, Prosecution and Co-ordinated Policies. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in Irish society for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The Department of Justice will also assume responsibility for services for victims of DSGBV, in addition to policy responsibility.<\/p><p>The Government is also continuing to drive forward the full implementation of <i>Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey. <\/i>This will ensure victims of crime are fully supported by our system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800070#WRY00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1440,"content":"<p>Question No. 554 answered with Question No. 553.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1441,"content":"<p>Question No. 555 answered with Question No. 553.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1443,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[5914\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800070#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider amending the bail laws in order that there will be a presumption against the grant of bail for a person accused of violent assault who already has convictions for violent assault in order to strengthen the protection of women from violent assaults; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1444,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the presiding Judge, who is independent in the exercise of his or her judicial functions. <\/p>  <p>  There is also a constitutional presumption in favour of the granting of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  The presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty has traditionally been considered by the courts to prohibit pre-trial detention except where it appeared that the accused person, if released on bail, was likely to evade justice by absconding or interfering with witnesses or evidence.   <\/p>  <p>  In the light of concerns at the increase in the incidence of offences committed while on bail, a referendum took place in 1996 on a proposed amendment to the Constitution to allow the courts to refuse bail where there are grounds for believing that the accused will commit serious offences while on bail. The referendum was passed and section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 gave effect to this constitutional amendment which permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.   <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 and the Criminal Justice Act 2017 amended the Bail Act 1997 to make further provision in respect of the criteria to be considered in refusing bail. <\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Act strengthened the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail. Under the Act, the Court is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the granting of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  It is also open to judges to refuse bail for a serious offence where that is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  <\/p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the 2017 Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews and strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail.  If an individual fails to comply with any of the bail conditions, the judge will issue a bench warrant. This gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to arrest and bring the person before the court to answer all charges relating to the bail.  In the event of a breach of High Court bail, an application is made to the High Court for a warrant and once arrested the defendant must be brought before the High Court as soon as practicable for a revocation hearing. A breach of bail may also result in an additional charge. The judge may also make an order and\/or surety for &lsquo;forfeiture and estreatment&rsquo; of the bail money.  <\/p>  <p>  Separately, I am working to strengthen the legislation in place to combat violence against women and before Easter, I will publish a Bill which will include new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation. While the act of stalking itself is already covered by existing law, I will propose changes to make the law clearer and stronger: <\/p>  <p>  - Explicitly reference stalking as a criminal offence <\/p>  <p>  - Make it clear that stalking includes watching or following a victim, even where they are not aware of being watched or followed.<\/p>  <p>  - Make it clear that impersonating the victim, and then communicating with a third party, is illegal<\/p>  <p>  - Update the law to ensure that it covers all forms of modern communications <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, while non-fatal strangulation is already an offence prosecutable under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, I believe that creating a new offence should encourage victims to come forward and report what has happened to them. It has been shown that this crime can be an indication of future, lethal violence and is a risk factor for homicides against women in the home.<\/p>  <p>  In the summer, I will publish a new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender. This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.<\/p>  <p>  For other crimes, where there isn&rsquo;t a dedicated hate-aggravated offence, the new legislation will require the court to take misogyny into account where there is evidence that this was the motivation, to reflect that fact in the sentence, and to reflect the fact that the crime was aggravated by this form of prejudice in the formal record.<\/p>  <p>  Before the end of September, I will publish a new Sexual Offences Bill, which will introduce important changes including:<\/p>  <p>  - Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims<\/p>  <p>  - Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public<\/p>  <p>  - Legal representation for victims <\/p>  <p>  I will also seek to enact the Sex Offenders Bill within months which will strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I will shortly sign an order to bring into operation the Criminal Procedure Act 2021. This Act provides for the use of preliminary trial hearings which will significantly improve the trial process for victims of sexual offences, including by reducing delay and disruption that might re-traumatise victims. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800070#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":1445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800070#WRY01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1446,"qnumday":557,"qnumall":"[5976\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800070#WRY01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider a representation by a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1447,"content":"<p>Nigerian nationals, who do not hold a document called a &ldquo;Residence card of a family member of a Union citizen&rdquo; as referred to in Articles 5(2) and 10(1) of Directive 2004\/38\/EC, and who wish to accompany or join their EU\/EEA\/Swiss citizen family member moving to or residing in Ireland, are visa required and must have a valid Irish visa before they seek to enter the State.

The Strategy is designed to provide a developmental framework to address key ongoing challenges, as well as new and emerging issues in the youth justice area.<\/p>  <p>  This includes preventing offending behaviour from occurring and diverting children and young adults who commit a crime away from further offending and involvement with the criminal justice system. It will also provide for enhanced criminal justice processes, detention and post-detention measures to provide consistent support to encourage desistance from crime and promote positive personal development for young offenders.<\/p>  <p>  Action 2.9.5 of the Strategy relates to assessing the potential of Youth Diversion Projects (or similar) to provide suitable diversionary programmes for the 18-24 years age group. In line with this action, my Department will shortly open a public consultation process on approaches to diverting young adults in the 18-24 age group away from crime, with a view to developing more effective measures which will lead to behaviour change. <\/p>  <p>  The aim is to steer young adults away from repeated offending, and towards positive life choices. Statistically, the 18-24 age group accounts for a significant volume of offending, so we need to engage more effectively to promote behaviour change as well as confronting with the immediate effects of criminal acts.<\/p>  <p>  Dedicated cross-agency oversight structures have been established to monitor and support the implementation of the Youth Justice Strategy, and these are further assisted by a Youth Justice Advisory Group, which I chair, that provides a standing forum to reflect views and concerns from the community sector and expert stakeholders. The commitment in the strategy to evidence-informed policies and practice is further enhanced through a Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice (REPPP) Advisory Group which allows input from the wider research community to support the REPPP research partnership with University of Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the additional &euro;6.7m provided for in Budget 2022 represents an increase of in excess of one third in support for youth justice services.

It should be noted that, where a more serious offence is committed and a knife is used in the commission of that offence (for example, assault or murder), that the charge brought forward will usually be for the more serious offence, and not solely possession of a weapon. <\/p><p>For the Deputy's information, however, I have contacted the Courts Service for information on the number of persons convicted of possession of a knife or other article contrary to Section 9(1) and 9(4) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 (as amended). <\/p><p>I have been advised by the Courts Service that Courts can only provide data in relation to where offence codes provided on the system were used by prosecutors. Prosecutors may have used uncoded free text offences and any such offences would not be included in the data provided. <\/p><p>It should also be noted that more serious instances of offences in relation to section 9(1) or 9(4) may have been sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court.  At this time, the system in use by the Courts Service in the Circuit Courts, the ICMS, cannot produce reports for specific offences. Therefore figures from the Circuit Courts are excluded from the information provided, which only relate to the District Court. <\/p><p>A person may be convicted for both offences and will appear more than once on the report.<\/p><p>For Court Areas absent from the report, this should be read as a zero value for that Court Area. <\/p><p>The no. of persons convicted for Possession of Knives &amp;amp;

We are all conscious of the very serious impact which violent crime has on victims and families, particularly attacks of a random nature. I condemn such crimes in the strongest possible terms.<\/p><p>In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB). The Forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counteract the negative impact of ASB on community morale and quality of life. This has included two subgroups established to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.<\/p><p>The knife crime subgroup is assessing available evidence to inform policy on knife crime, with particular reference to effectiveness of proposals, to inform both legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices. The work of this subgroup is ongoing and is expected to conclude in the coming months.<\/p><p>My Department is also currently looking at data sources to improve data quality in this area. Officials are engaging with public health colleagues, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to improve our understanding of the level of violent assaults within our society.<\/p><p>Crime of any sort is not a phenomenon that exists in isolation. It is inevitably connected to significant and often complex underlying factors. Information provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na notes that knife-related crime trends should also be viewed in the context of the pandemic and the associated general decrease in criminality, but also the successful number of proactive seizures and interventions by Garda&iacute;. Increases in seizures may be due to proactive policing operations, particularly during 2020, with the increased Garda presence in support of the COVID-19 public health measures. <\/p><p>There was also a substantial year-on-year increase in the number of searches conducted in 2020, many of which were associated with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s high visibility operations supporting the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated Garda operations (such as Operation Fanacht). <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently operating an Assault Reduction Strategy, which includes assaults with offensive weapons, and the 'Use Your Brain Not Your Fists' campaign, highlighting the dangers and consequences of assaults to not only the victims, but to perpetrators as well.<\/p><p>To be of assistance to the Deputy, I have contacted the Garda Authorities for the information requested and I have been advised that for the years in question the number of knives seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>       <th>2021<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Count of Knives Seized <\/td>       <td>2,145<\/td>       <td>2,253<\/td>       <td>1,818<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Figures were collated based on PULSE data as of 1:30am on 2 February 2022.

Drafting of the Bill is now underway. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill will set out the framework and legislative basis for the establishment of a new independent, statutory body &ndash; the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland &ndash; to implement a robust regulatory and licensing regime for the gambling sector. <\/p>  <p>  A Programme Board has been established in my Department to ensure that the legislation and the operational preparations are progressed in parallel so that the Authority commences operations as soon as possible after enactment. There is a pathway mapped for this legislation progressing, which will facilitate the Authority being established and operational in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The Authority will have the necessary enforcement powers for licensing and to enable it to take appropriate and focused action where providers are failing to comply with the provisions of this Bill and with the Authority&rsquo;s licensing terms and conditions, regulations and codes.<\/p>  <p>  Certain pragmatic prohibitions are being put forward to minimise the ill-effects of gambling. Such measures include the establishment of an exclusionary register and the prohibition of credit facilities and inducements.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of an exclusionary register by the Authority will assist those people who do not want to participate in any licensed gambling, betting or lottery activities provided by licence holders. <\/p>  <p>  The Exclusionary Register will be completely voluntary and may only be accessed by the Authority or the licence holders, insofar as to assist them in preventing persons on the register from accessing premises or services licensed by the Authority, at the request of the person. A person may request to be excluded from entering all gaming premises or specified gaming premises, and\/or from accessing and participating in (all or specified) licensed games, services and activities provided by all licence holders. <\/p>  <p>  Affordability checks are not provided for under this legislation.

Further, a person may have had an offence struck out or dismissed in more than one court area so would be displayed more than once in this report. <table>    <tr>       <th>Court Area<\/th>       <th>Jan &ndash; Dec 2018<\/th>       <th>Jan &ndash; Dec 2019<\/th>       <th>Jan &ndash; Dec 2020<\/th>       <th>Jan &ndash; Dec 2021<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>BALLINASLOE<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CARLOW<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CORK CITY<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DUBLIN METROPOLITAN DISTRICT<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DUNDALK<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DUNGARVAN<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LONGFORD<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LOUGHREA<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>MACROOM<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>MULLINGAR<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TUAM<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>11<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>For comparison purposes, the Courts Service have provided the following information on the total number of persons listed to appear in each Court Area for the offence of driving whilst holding a mobile phone.

The aim of the programme is to divert children and young people who have engaged in criminal or anti-social behaviour away from the criminal justice system and towards more positive life choices. Children who commit criminal offences are considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme. Each such case is assessed and the Director of the Garda Diversion Programme (a Garda Superintendent) decides if the case is suitable or not for inclusion. <\/p><p>The operation of the programme includes informal and formal Garda warnings, delivered in the presence of parents or guardians, as well as provision for supervision by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO). A JLO is a Garda who works full time with young people who come in contact with the criminal justice system.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible, by law, for the administration and management of Garda business, including the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme. As Minister, I play no role in these independent functions.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recently conducted two reviews of the Diversion Programme:<\/p><p>1. Hussey Review 2016 - 2018<\/p><p>2.

These figures are sourced from S.44 Monitoring Committee Reports, which are available on the Garda website. I am further advised that statistics for 2020 have not yet been published.<\/p><p>The Youth Justice Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for the development  of Youth Justice services including the Garda Diversion Programme.  A key priority is the hard-to-reach cohort with problematic offending patterns.<\/p><p>In addition to the Garda Diversion Programme, the Deputy will be aware that Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs) are run by community-based organisations in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These local YDPs provide an essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme, and are fully funded by my Department.<\/p><p>I am pleased to note that the additional &euro;6.7m provided for in Budget 2022 represents an increase of in excess of one third in support for youth justice services. It provides the resources to kick-start delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy and, in particular, the programme to expand and deepen the range of supports made available through local YDP services. The main elements of this work are:<\/p><p>- Establishment of a limited number of new youth projects and boundary extensions of existing projects so as to ensure that the youth diversion services are available throughout the State by end-2022 or shortly thereafter.<\/p><p>- Enhancement of the youth diversion service, in accordance with identified local needs, to include:<\/p><p>- Early intervention and family support work<\/p><p>- Outreach with harder-to-engage young people<\/p><p>- Support for schools to retain challenging children<\/p><p>- Other specific initiatives e.g. in relation to anti-social use of scramblers and knife crime issues.<\/p><p>- Dedicated research and expert support, including best practice support for the nationwide project network, facilitated by the REPPP project team in the University of Limerick. <\/p><p>The ongoing development and review of Youth Justice systems is facilitated by the dedicated cross-agency governance and oversight structures provided for in the implementation of the Youth Justice Strategy, which include representatives of senior Garda management. <\/p><p>I can inform the Deputy that both I and my senior officials are in regular and frequent communication with the Garda Commissioner and his senior management team.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.<\/p><p>As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which included a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and urgent time sensitive work - in particular in Model 4 hospitals. Services are beginning to return to normal but elective procedures continue to be affected by staff absences due to Covid and emergency department pressures that are running above 2019 levels.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of December 2021 there were 4,614 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,440 in December 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy regarding cataract surgery in the HSE west region is outlined in the attached document.

The rationale for such time limits is to ensure that appropriate medical care continues to be afforded to persons in receipt of prescriptions.<\/p>  <p>  However, in April 2020, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the then Minister for Health, Simon Harris T.D., introduced temporary, emergency provisions to enable pharmacists to ensure the continuity of care of patients without necessarily requiring a new prescription and to reduce pressures on General Practitioners at that time:<\/p>  <p>  -  the maximum period of validity of a prescription for non-controlled drugs was temporarily increased from 6 months to 9 months as of the date specified on the prescription.<\/p>  <p>  -  Some temporary changes to the way in which prescriptions can be repeated by pharmacists were introduced to enable pharmacists to ensure the continuity of care of patients without necessarily requiring a new prescription to be obtained from their prescriber. This is enabled in circumstances where:<\/p>  <p>  -  it is the professional judgement of the pharmacist that it is safe, appropriate, and necessary for the continued treatment of the person for a further supply to be made, AND<\/p>  <p>  -  it is unreasonable at the time for the person to obtain a new prescription.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments in April 2020 also introduced the electronic transfer of prescriptions, whereby an electronic version of a new prescription may be transmitted from the prescriber to a pharmacy of a patient&rsquo;s choice where it may not be possible or appropriate to attend a clinic or surgery at this time. This mechanism also facilitates individuals to obtain an up-to-date prescription and to enable the pharmacist to continue to dispense their prescription(s).<\/p>  <p>  In light of the ongoing pandemic conditions the temporary provisions introduced continue to apply and have not yet been revoked. It is important to note that none of the temporary amendments impose a duty on a prescriber to issue a prescription beyond a period they consider to be clinically appropriate, or on a pharmacist to dispense any prescription where they do not consider it safe, appropriate and necessary for the continued treatment of a person for a further supply to be made without a new prescription issued by the prescriber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800078#WRGG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1983,"qnumday":738,"qnumall":"[6517\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800078#WRGG03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of the way the two consultations per annum with general practitioners and other doctors to discuss forms of contraception suitable for individual patients and to enable prescription of same will be administered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1984,"content":"<p>The Report of the Working Group on Access to Contraception, published in October 2019, identified the barriers that exist to accessing contraception for a significant amount of women in Ireland including accessibility, education, workforce capacity and cost.

This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic.

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.<\/p>  <p>  We have made a specific commitment to supporting \"the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland\". A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls.<\/p>  <p>  The Healthy Workplace Framework, published in December 2021, aims to support the growth of effective approaches to enhance health and wellbeing in the workplace. The Framework is underpinned by robust evidence and consultation. An Implementation Group is in the process of being established, which will hold responsibility for developing an action plan. It is envisaged that a representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to help ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the treatment of endometriosis, I am advised that a GP referral to a gynaecologist is the standard pathway of care for the management of endometriosis in Ireland. This is similar to the pathway in place for the management of other gynaecological conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Information provided by the HSE indicates that endometriosis is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat because of the variation of presentations, impacting the physical and mental wellbeing of patients at varying levels. Treatment may include pain medications, hormone treatment and surgical interventions. The time to diagnose endometriosis varies by patient due to its varying and ambiguous symptom presentation. The HSE's National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.<\/p>  <p>  As such, the Programme has developed an Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care which centres on the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; ambulatory gynaecology clinics. An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources than the traditional outpatient model and it is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  Building on progress made in rolling out these ambulatory gynaecology clinics in 2020 and 2021, funding has been provided under Budget 2022 which will facilitate the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics, thereby completing the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. This will bring the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, in April 2021, I announced the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) to deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there is no ready access in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Further to the above, funding provided under Budget 2022 will enable the expansion of the endometriosis service at TUH as well as the establishment of a new service for more complex endometriosis cases at Cork University Maternity Hospital<\/p>  <p>  The issue of endometriosis has also been highlighted through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.  278 women participated in open interviews and workshops.

Moral equality is a key principle underpinning the Allocation Framework for Equitable Access to COVID-19 vaccines, approved by NPHET. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the principles of equity and moral equality, Ireland has committed to the donation of up to five million COVID-19 vaccine doses through the COVAX vaccine initiative and bilateral arrangements with recipient countries. To date, arrangements are in place for the donation of 2.9 million doses. Over 1.5 million doses have already been delivered to recipient countries including Uganda, Nigeria, Indonesia and Ghana. Additional vaccine deliveries are expected to follow shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":2084,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2085,"qnumday":775,"qnumall":"[6619\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if section 38 healthcare workers in disability services will be included in the Covid recognition payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2086,"content":"<p>Firstly I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the efforts of the general public, volunteers and all workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Wednesday 19 January, the Government announced a once-off public holiday will take place on Friday 18 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced COVID-19 recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to recognise their unique role during the pandemic.

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff \/ equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended. <\/p>  <p>  The cost of providing a recognition payment of &euro;1,000 to all eligible public servants working in the health and ambulance services depends on the number of staff who are eligible for the payment. If there were 100,000 WTE deemed eligible, the estimated cost would be approximately &euro;100 million. This figure of 100,000 WTE represents approximately 75% of the HSE\/Section 38 workforce and would be the minimum expected to be eligible for this recognition payment.  <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the cost of providing an equivalent recognition payment to relevant staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19 depends on the number of staff deemed eligible for the payment. The estimated cost set out above does not include the cost in respect of nursing homes and Defence Forces staff. This measure will exclude all private sector health workers except those working in nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19.  This measure, including costings, will be progressed by the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly.

The model of care for infertility was developed by my officials in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme in order to ensure that infertility issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.<\/p>  <p>  This model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs), extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways.<\/p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues at this level of intervention. The completion of Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced.<\/p>  <p>  Publication of the Bill to regulate the area of AHR is a priority for the Government and officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General are continuing to engage intensively in order to finalise this legislation, which encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction. I expect to be in a position to bring a Memorandum to Government seeking approval to publish the Bill in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":2117,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK04500"},{"type":"question","counter":2118,"qnumday":787,"qnumall":"[6649\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he has taken to ensure that the text service (details supplied) funded by the HSE has not engaged in misuse of data collected by its service as has reportedly happened at its linked company in the United States of America (details supplied) which has reportedly shared data collected from those texting the line with a for-profit spinoff company.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2119,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK04800"},{"type":"question","counter":2121,"qnumday":788,"qnumall":"[6650\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800081#WRKK04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) will have their appointment confirmed.","asker":"1488","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2122,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Consideration is also being given to the future role of testing and tracing particularly as the need evolves to move from extensive case finding and tracing of infection aimed at reducing transmission, to one primarily focused on mitigation of the severe impacts of COVID-19, particularly for those most vulnerable to the effects of the disease and for those with risk factors for severe disease who may benefit from specific interventions.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to COVID-19 treatments, the HSE has established a Therapeutics Operational Group which has been working to develop the arrangements for provision of these treatments to the right patients, and work is ongoing to establish and develop the most efficient pathways to identify those patients who may benefit from their use.

This is particularly important during the current pandemic. Covid-19 has presented significant challenges for people&rsquo;s mental health, including increased stress, anxiety and fear. While there is no doubt that Covid-19 has posed significant challenges, including isolation, bereavement, anxiety and loss of income and work for many, we do not yet fully understand the full impact of Covid-19 on mental health, the extent of subsequent supports that may be required or how this may affect longer term demand for services. However, a negative mental health outcome for our population from this pandemic is not inevitable if we set about responding to the challenge in a cohesive manner.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and HSE continue to provide high quality mental health services to children and young people, including enhancing supports in response to the challenges posed by Covid-19. Further developments in child and youth mental health, including improved access and reducing waiting lists, continues in line with our national mental health policy Sharing the Vision and annual HSE National Service Plans.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided unprecedented funding of &euro;1.149 billion for HSE Mental Health, an increase of &euro;47 million on 2021. This includes funding for two CAMHS telehubs and &euro;6 million to expand the capacity of community mental health teams, with a particular emphasis on CAMHS. National clinical programmes (including in the area of eating disorders) continue to be invested in, many of which are available to children and young people.<\/p>  <p>  2022 funding includes &euro;10 million for initiatives aimed at increasing mental health supports in response to the pandemic including enhanced signposting and access to existing mental health services and supports, initiatives for children, young people and students, and additional psychosocial responses, recognising that people will require varying levels of support.<\/p>  <p>  A further &euro;10 million is available in once off, additional funding to improve the experiences of individuals, including children and young people accessing specialist mental health services, in addition to community and voluntary mental supports. This includes &euro;1 million for MyMind to deliver approximately 16,500 free of charge talking therapy sessions, to people impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under 18s can access the sessions with parental supervision.  &euro;1 million will be distributed by Mental Health Ireland through their extensive network of grassroots mental health organisations, including child and youth groups, in local communities nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has a range of proactive responses for any rise in mental health service need, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports. The Department of Health and HSE continue to plan for any increase in demand as it arises.<\/p>  <p>  Significant additional funding has been provided to the HSE throughout the pandemic for mental health promotion and well-being campaigns and enhanced online supports to improve population health outcomes. Telehealth services are fully established including YourMentalHealth.ie, which offers a wealth of information on mental health supports and coping with difficult situations during Covid-19; the information line 1800 111 888, and online supports provided to children and young people through the crisis textline, 50808; MyMind; Turn2Me; Jigsaw and many others.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE are developing greater use of digital technology to improve flexibility between blended and traditional care options. This includes for example three new CAMHS tele-hubs nationally.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Psychosocial Framework, published in January 2021, builds on a range of supports introduced in response to Covid-19, including self- help and psychological first aid supports for staff. The Framework acknowledges the impact of the pandemic on mental health in all areas of society.<\/p>  <p>  Since launching in September a &euro;4 million initiative to reduce the number of children and young people under 18 waiting over 12 months to access primary care psychology services has enabled more than 1,600 young people to access treatment than otherwise would have done.<\/p>  <p>  The specialist CAMHS service has continued to operate at over 90% capacity of pre-Covid levels. In CAMHS, there are two types of referrals; an urgent referral and a routine referral.

I would obviously encourage any landowner to do so immediately and enjoy the significant economic benefits of doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Improved licensing output has a role to play in building confidence among farmers and landowners, and in increasing demand for licences and planting rates. That is why I am attaching such importance to improving output in 2022. We are already making progress. However, we also need to address the broader issue of increasing the level of interest in planting among farmers and landowners.  In 2021, there were 502 afforestation licences issued.  Those licences would have facilitated the planting of over 4,200 ha, but only 2,000 ha have been planted to date. The conversion rate from licensing to planting, at about 64%, is low. This means that at present, a  disproportionate amount of processing effort both by the Department and forestry companies is wasted. <\/p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, I am equally concerned about the decline in the number of applications for planting licences in recent years. This should be of concern to all of us who want to see more trees planted in Ireland.  In addition to the progress made already, my department has, through Project Woodland,  commissioned reviews of its processes and the regulatory framework with a view to further increasing the efficiency of the licensing system.  I am also introducing an amendment to the Forestry Act 2014 to facilitate small scale tree-planting  without the need for a licence.  <\/p>  <p>  But we also have to get much better at communicating the benefits of forestry to those we are trying to encourage to plant trees. On most farms, planting can comfortably co-exist with livestock enterprises and can significantly increase the net income from the holding. <\/p>  <p>  Farmers who plant trees on a portion of their lands, can continue to engage in their traditional farm enterprises. They can also continue to receive their Basic Payment on planted lands, and will receive grants to cover establishment costs, generous premia over 15 years and substantial tax free income at thinning and harvesting time.<\/p>  <p>  It is critically important that everyone with an interest in developing the sector works closely together to communicate these extraordinarily positive messages to farmers and landowners.
