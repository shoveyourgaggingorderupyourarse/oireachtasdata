To achieve this ambition, several\u00a0renewable energy generation technologies will\u00a0be required\u00a0including onshore wind, solar and offshore wind. This multi-technology approach not only increases our renewable energy production capacity, but\u00a0also enhances our energy security\u00a0by diversifying our sources of renewable energy.   The 2019 Climate Action Plan included indicative additional installed capacities of 1.5GW of solar, approximately 4GW of additional onshore wind and 3.5GW of offshore wind by 2030. The Programme for Government has since increased the offshore target to 5GW by 2030, and a long-term plan to take advantage of at least 30GW of floating wind thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  All three technologies will be supported via competitive auctions under\u00a0the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). Other renewable energy technologies are also eligible for support.\u00a0The first RESS auction, RESS 1, was held last year and awarded supports to approximately 80 new onshore wind and solar projects. The second RESS auction, RESS 2, is planned to be held next year. My\u00a0officials are working to finalise the auction design and my aim\u00a0is to\u00a0accelerate\u00a0the current auction timetable and\u00a0deliver a second onshore RESS auction.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also developing the first of a series of RESS auctions specific to offshore wind.

This landmark legislation sets a legally-binding framework for Ireland to achieve the national climate objective of a transition to a climate resilient, biodiversity rich, environmentally sustainable and climate neutral economy by 2050 at the latest. Under the new legislation, my Department will prepare for Government a Climate Action Plan, which \u00a0must be updated every year so that our actions keep step with the trajectory required to achieve our targets. In addition, a national long-term climate action strategy will be prepared at least every 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  The Department will also have a lead role in transforming our energy sector to a high-renewable, low-carbon system. This will include achieving 70% renewable electricity through increased onshore and offshore wind, solar, microgeneration, and grid system infrastructure. We will also need to reduce the use of fossil fuels in our homes and make them more energy efficient. This will mean a large-scale roll-out of home retrofits and the installation of heat pumps. <\/p>  <p>  The circular economy offers an alternative to today&rsquo;s linear - &lsquo;take-make-waste&rsquo; - model of production and consumption, in which we extract great quantities of natural resources to make things that we may use only once before throwing them away. In a circular economy, resources are kept in use for as long as possible, the maximum value is extracted from them while in use, then recovered and repurposed into new products and materials at the end of each lifecycle. The forthcoming All-of-Government Circular Economy Strategy and related\u00a0legislation will provide an overall national policy framework for the circular transition and will include measures to improve Ireland&rsquo;s circularity performance.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also supporting universal access to high-speed broadband for better connected communities with service providers properly regulated, and strengthened cyber security.

My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project for 2021. The impact on future years continues to be assessed. \u00a0NBI is putting in place mitigation measures to address the impact of the pandemic on the programme to date. These include<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month<\/p>  <p>  - Bringing in more resources to NBI<\/p>  <p>  - Purchasing more materials earlier<\/p>  <p>  - Bringing in more subcontractors<\/p>  <p>  While delivery of the Programme is the responsibility of NBI under the Contract, my Department continues to monitor delivery very closely. In parallel with the ongoing oversight of the contract, my Department has also been working with the 31 Local Authorities, the County and City Management Agency (CCMA), the Roads Maintenance Office (RMO), Broadband Officers and other Government Departments, where appropriate, to ensure that any possible barriers that might delay the rollout are addressed as soon as possible. This also includes engagement with other bodies such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Irish Rail and ComReg.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The contract makes provision for dealing with delays to delivery of the network arising from unprecedented events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and NBI can seek additional time to meet contract milestones. In those circumstances no penalties would apply. In other circumstances, the contract provides that penalty provisions relating to delays to delivery of the network are applicable with respect to any delays that occur from the end of contract year 2 (i.e. from 1 February 2022).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600075#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600076#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[43930\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600076#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the policy of his Department with regard to the production and use of green hydrogen in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government recognises\u00a0the\u00a0need for\u00a0research and development of hydrogen from renewable sources, known as &lsquo;green hydrogen&rsquo;, for use in power generation and as a\u00a0zero-emission energy source in difficult-to-decarbonise sectors such as transport and industry.In July 2020, the European Commission published a hydrogen strategy for a carbon-neutral Europe.

It seeks to strengthen the alignment with the National Planning Framework as well as take into account key developments since the launch of the current NDP in 2018. It will examine developments in the context of each National Strategic Outcome. It will take into account the commitments set out in the Programme for Government. It will also take into account the impacts of Brexit and Covid-19 as well as reflect key policy developments in areas such as Climate Change and the completion of Regional, Economic and Spatial Strategies for the three Assembly Regions.<\/p><p>I would also like to highlight that all national road projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, are subject to applicable statutory approval and compliance with the Public Spending Code.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate protection and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the protection and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects including a number of bypass\/relief projects such as the Portlaoise Southern Distributor Road, Dingle Relief Road, Sligo Western Distributor Road, Sallins Bypass, Tralee Northern Relief Road, Athy Southern Distributor Road and Shannon Crossing\/Killaloe Bypass\/R494 Upgrade, Athenry Relief Road and the Edenderry Inner Relief Road.<\/p><p><b>Enhanced Regional Accessibility <\/b><\/p><p>A core priority under the NPF is to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions, in parallel with fostering compact growth of urban centres. This has an important role to play in maximising the growth potential of the regional urban centres and the economy as a whole. Substantial progress has been made since 2000 in improving the road linkages between Dublin and most of the other urban areas and regions.

Cork, which considered constraints and issues in the area. The study indicates significant constraints will need to be examined in the planning of such a scheme and that a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) and an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) would be required.\u00a0<\/p><p>The report also indicates that a feasible Outer Bypass would have to be progressed as a Major Scheme, which is not provided for in the current NDP.<\/p><p>In the meantime, TII has requested Cork County Council to further assess whether an inner relief road that represents value for money, could be a more feasible option than a major bypass.\u00a0 Geophysical and geotechnical surveys have been procured.<\/p><p>TII has provided an allocation of &euro;100,000 to the Council for 2021 to progress this further study on scheme feasibility.<\/p><p><b>Possible Benefits<\/b><\/p><p>The Castlemartyr Bypass scheme, if found to be viable and feasible, could remove a significant portion of national through traffic from the village, thereby improving safety and facilitating the reliability of journey times for public transport.

I was delighted with the uptake of this Programme, with applications from over 900 schools received. 170 schools around the country will receive funding under the first round of the Safe Routes to School Programme; I would like to note that the remaining schools who\u00a0applied initially for the Programme will not be required to reapply as all schools which applied will come into the Programme on a rolling basis.<\/p>  <p>  With the allocation of additional funding comes the problem of local authorities actually having the capacity to spend it and deliver the projects as planned.

This funding stream constitutes the first ever major Active Travel investment programme for rural Ireland and will support the roll out of high-quality active travel infrastructure in rural towns and villages across the country. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) who are leading on the development of a National Cycle Network which will both map the existing Active Travel infrastructure around the country, including Greenways, and identify gaps which will inform future planning decisions for walking and cycling infrastructure in our cities, towns, villages and rural areas. It aims to provide a basis for the delivery of a high-quality, integrated Active Travel network which will seek to connect footpaths, cycle tracks and Greenways, potentially via improving Active Travel infrastructure on existing rural, local, regional and national roads. This has the potential to also identify areas where reallocation of road space would be more appropriate than the development of new infrastructure, such as on more lightly trafficked roads in rural areas.

Since May 2021, the RSA has been returning to delivering tests for all customers, while continuing to prioritise critical frontline workers who need to drive as part of their job (this does not include commuting to their job).\u00a0In the interest of fairness, the RSA targeted test appointments to those waiting longest who are ready and eligible to take the test<\/p>  <p>  The service continues to operate under restrictions in the interest of making it safe while there is an ongoing presence of Covid. <\/p>  <p>  The RSA intend to increase the number of tests from 6 to 7 per tester per day from late September.<\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority received sanction to hire 40 new temporary testers, in addition to 36 they were sanctioned to retain or rehire in 2020. These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0An extra 10 temporary test centres have been opened (and are effectively an expansion of existing locations or replacing unsuitable locations), and a further 9 locations have been expanded within the existing premises, to accommodate more testers. <\/p>  <p>  The Driver Theory Test service has significantly increased its capacity since it reopened in June 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The number of tests provided has now increased from an average pre Covid19 level of 15,000 to over 25,000 appointments monthly. This number continues to increase and almost 50,000 tests were provided during the month of August.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA has also been working to extend its online theory testing service.

TII ultimately delivers the National Roads Programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the NDP.<\/p><p>In that context, TII provides my Department with regular updates on its delivery of the National Roads Programme. The following information is the most up to-date information available to me on TII&rsquo;s delivery of projects on the N26.<\/p><p><b>Background<\/b><\/p><p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the NPF.\u00a0 This provides the strategic and financial framework for the National Roads Programme for the period from 2018 to 2027. The focus of TII's activities is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP, along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to bring forward the review of the NDP from 2022 and to use the review to set out an updated NDP for the period out to 2030. The review of the NDP will be aligned with the NPF and Project Ireland 2040. Work has been undertaken within my Department to contribute to this review, with national roads funding being finalised and a prioritisation of projects to follow.<\/p><p>I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, are subject to applicable statutory approval and compliance with the Public Spending Code.<\/p><p><b>Enhanced Regional Accessibility under the NDP<\/b><\/p><p>A core priority under the NPF is to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions, in parallel with fostering compact growth of urban centres. This has an important role to play in maximising the growth potential of the regional urban centres and the economy as a whole. Substantial progress has been made since 2000 in improving the road linkages between Dublin and most of the other urban areas and regions. Under the current NDP, the objective is to complete those linkages so that every region and all the major urban areas, particularly those in the North-West, are linked to Dublin by a high-quality road network.<\/p><p>In 2020, there was significant progress in developing new transport links through the appraisal, planning and procurement stages. As set out in Project Ireland 2040, improving access to the north-west is a strategic aim to support balanced national development. National road projects in the region at or close to construction phase are as follows:<\/p><p>- The N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin project in Sligo received Government approval in January 2019. Construction on the project is ongoing and it is expected to be complete in late 2021. This will deliver 14.7km of improvements, including the provision of safe overtaking opportunities, appropriate road alignment and a reduction in junctions and private accesses onto the road. <\/p><p>- The N5 Westport to Turlough project in Mayo received Government approval in October 2019 and construction is ongoing. This will deliver 20km of dual carriageway and a 2.5km bypass of Westport which will deliver improved journey times and an improvement of the urban environments of Westport and Castlebar with the reduction of traffic within the towns.<\/p><p>- The N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge project received Government approval in June 2021 and is due to commence construction over the coming months. This will deliver \u00a033.4km of single carriageway bypassing Frenchpark, Bellangare, Tulsk and Strokestown, increasing the safety and capacity of the N5.<\/p><p><b>N26 Road Projects<\/b><\/p><p>While there are currently no specific projects on the N26 included in the current NDP, there is a general commitment for targeted improvements to address bottlenecks and enhance safety on this route. The following are a number of projects that are ongoing on the route to achieve these targeted improvements.<\/p><p>- The construction contract for the Cloongulane Bridge Scheme was awarded in October 2020, and TII provided an allocation of &euro;2.5 million in 2020 and a further allocation of &euro;7 million in 2021 to Mayo County Council to progress this project through construction, which commenced in November 2020. It is expected to be complete by Q3 2022.<\/p><p>- An allocation of &euro;50,000 was provided by TII to Mayo County Council in 2020 for the preparation of a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for the proposed link road between the N26 and N59. The SAR was approved by my Department in March 2021 and TII have provided an allocation of &euro;100,000 in 2021 to progress this minor safety scheme through the early planning and design phases. The project is currently at Phase 2 Route Selection. Should an option be identified during this phase that would deliver on the scheme objectives and provide value for money, It is likely that the scheme would progress to planning and publication of statutory orders in early to mid 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[43681\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to sign the statutory instrument to allow for agreed pension entitlement changes to the CI&Eacute; regular wages scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[43682\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will meet representatives of workers in CI&Eacute; who face reduced pension entitlements as a result of the delay in signing a statutory instrument to give effect to agreed changes to the CI&Eacute; regular wages scheme; the timeframe for signing the statutory instrument given the numbers of workers adversely affected by the continued delay in signing same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[44267\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when he will sign the statutory instrument to give effect to agreed changes to the regular wages scheme pension of CI&Eacute; workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":200,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 128 and 178 together.<\/p>  <p>The CI&Eacute; Group has two pension schemes, namely the Regular Wages Scheme (&ldquo;RWS&rdquo;) and 1951 superannuation scheme (&ldquo;1951 Scheme&rdquo;) and issues in relation to CI&Eacute; pension schemes are primarily a matter for the trustees of the schemes, the CI&Eacute; Group and their employees.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Regular Wages Scheme, CI&Eacute; has prepared and submitted draft Statutory Instruments (SIs) to give effect to the proposed changes to the scheme.

Some employees will be required to continue working their full contracted hours and others will not. Cork Airport will strive to maintain current pay arrangements at 100% during the 10-week closure. However, where full contracted hours are not available and to enable the airport to maintain wages at 100%, this will be achieved through a combination of working hours and annual leave or time in lieu. In some cases, team members have been asked to support other areas of the business for the duration of the project.<\/p>  <p>  Employment issues of other personnel employed through contracted services are matters between those personnel and their respective employers. While there are no specific financial supports being rolled out by my Department for companies\/employees directly impacted by the closure of Cork Airport, I understand that the local Intreo Office is aware of the situation in respect of Cork Airport and will be able to offer practical, tailored services and supports for those affected by the closure. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, more generally speaking, in response to the impacts of COVID-19, Government has put in place a number of economy wide financial supports. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, wage subsidies have served as the keystone of the Government&rsquo;s provision of financial supports in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This began with the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and, to date, is continued by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which operates across all sectors of the economy. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Government is fully committed to protecting jobs for aviation workers and helping the sector get back on its feet.  State-aid compliant Schemes, with a budget of &euro;26m were developed by my Department, to help address liquidity issues at our State and Regional airports as a result of COVID-19 and Cork airport has received funding under one of these Schemes.  This funding will provide Cork with the flexibility to roll out route incentives\/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity when the airport reopens in November.  I understand that the daa has already developed major new airport charges discount schemes at Cork (and Dublin airports) to help kickstart air travel to and from Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The State aid schemes are part of an overall &euro;80 million aviation-specific support package in 2021. To date in 2021 Cork Airport has been allocated &euro;10m in Exchequer funding for their runway overlay project, under the Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021.  Cork Airport is also eligible for a share (with Shannon Airport) of &euro;15.6m in operational supports under this Programme and my Department has recently invited Cork to apply for funding under this Scheme which will be disbursed later this year.  This operational funding is in addition to &euro;1.4m allocated to Cork Airport under the Damages Measure of the aforementioned State aid scheme.<\/p>  <p>  By virtue of its size and passenger numbers, Cork Airport has not previously been eligible for funding under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025.  However, in light of the impacts of Covid-19 resulting in suppressed passenger numbers, Cork airport (along with Shannon Airport) will be eligible for supports under the Programme in 2022. The level of funding that might be available under this Programme next year is currently being considered in the context of the Estimates process in relation to Budget 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Government is willing to keep under review any additional supports that may be necessary.  The Economic Recovery Plan published by Government on the 1 June, explicitly references this and recognises that additional supports may be required to assist the restoration of Ireland's air links, protect jobs in the sector, and support the aviation sector&rsquo;s recovery and my officials are currently considering options in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD06200"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[44233\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD06300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the timeline for the implementation of regulations for escooters and ebikes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>My intention is\u00a0to legislate for e-scooters and e-bikes in accordance with the Programme for Government.

This builds on the positive leadership and market impacts that green public procurement policies can have on the development and uptake of innovative lower-carbon goods and services; and, complements wider Government commitments to transition public and private transport fleets from fossil fuel technologies.<\/p><p>Ireland now has a legal obligation to ensure that a proportion of public vehicle procurement is low-emission or zero-emission. <\/p><p>Definitions of what constitute &lsquo;clean&rsquo; vehicles are established in the legislation based on vehicle type. Light duty clean vehicles are defined by specified low tail-pipe emissions levels. For the heavy duty sector, &lsquo;clean&rsquo; vehicles are defined by low or zero-emission power - with a range of alternative fuel technologies included in this definition (such as battery, hydrogen fuel cell, biofuel, synthetic-fuel and gas-powered vehicles). <\/p><p>All public sector bodies will be compelled to apply the Directive if the value of their vehicle procurements is above relevant procurement thresholds as set out in Regulations amending the EU thresholds for the Directives 2014\/24\/EU and 2014\/25\/EU.

The Directive and the associated regulations have been designed to take this into account and two reference periods for procurement targets have been set between now and 2030 with different minimum procurement targets applying to each. Between now and 2025, 38.5% of light-duty vehicles, 10% of trucks and 45% of buses procured under the relevant procurement value thresholds must be clean vehicles. <\/p><p>Between 2025 and 2030, the minimum procurement target of 38.5% clean vehicles will still apply to light duty vehicles, but more stringent targets will apply to heavy vehicles included in the Directive&rsquo;s provisions. In this later reference period, 15% of trucks and 65% of buses will have to be clean vehicles. <\/p><p>Due to the current limitations of alternative fuels technologies, certain categories of vehicle have also been excluded or have been exempted from the provisions of the Directive. These include coaches, specialised heavy duty vehicles used in agriculture and forestry, special vehicles used by the police, defence forces, civil and fire protection, as well as ambulances, hearses, wheelchair accessible cars and mobile cranes. As alternative fuel technologies for these vehicle segments develops, it is intended that these exemptions will be reviewed in future iterations of the Directive, and that national procurement targets will be amended as appropriate. <\/p><p>My Department will continue to work with public bodies to ensure that they are aware of the requirements of the Directive as provided for under the new Regulations and will support industry in developing relevant guidance material in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":228,"content":"<p>Question No. 99 answered with Question No. 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Policy","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD07300"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[44082\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600078#WRD07400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the timeline for the delivery an updated national cycle manual in view of the letter received from 28 groups (details supplied); if the guidance in the manual will be integrated with the design manual for urban roads and streets; his views on whether there is a need to adopt interim standards to ensure quality of infrastructure rolled out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>The National Cycle Manual was first published by the National Transport Authority (NTA) in 2011\u00a0and is the principal source for guidance on the design of cycle facilities in Ireland.

It will provide a platform to advance the ambitions of the Programme for Government in the area of sustainable mobility, including in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Our committments in both the Programme for Government and \"Our Rural Future\" in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement. <\/p>  <p>  Among the measures we will prioritise is the NTA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan&rdquo; to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, expanding TFI Local Link services and prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity. <\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.\u00a0 The NTA also has responsibility for local and rural transport, including the management of Rural Transport Programme (RTP) which operates under the TFI Local Link brand.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NTA is developing its \"Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan\", which has the objective of providing better connections between villages and towns through enhanced and new local routes. These local routes will be integrated with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide. Connecting Ireland is being developed by identifying and measuring the extent of gaps in connectivity between settlements, outside of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford; and also through developing a set of proposals to address those gaps, by enhancing existing services and introducing new ones.<\/p>  <p>  In developing the Connecting Ireland initiative, the NTA undertook workshops with local authorities nationally.\u00a0The NTA will shortly be undertaking a public consultation on the proposals emanating from Connecting Ireland. \u00a0The consultation will provide all interested parties and the general public with an opportunity to review and comment on the proposals. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600079#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[44096\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600079#WRE04700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to support the taxi industry in the time ahead in view of the fact that work volumes remain significantly reduced related to Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>I recognise that the\u00a0SPSV industry has been very badly affected by COVID-19 which brought about an almost complete collapse in passenger demand for taxi and other SPSV services. I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers have availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which, as the Deputy will be aware, has been extended to February 2022. Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given 8-week period, net of expenses.<\/p>  <p>  Based on figures from the National Transport Authority (NTA) I am pleased to advise that passenger demand for SPSV services is now rising as we progress through the next and final phase of the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic:\u00a0COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting. NTA figures also show a steady\u00a0increase in the proportion of taxi drivers working over the last few months: from 36% of all drivers working in January 2021 to 62% working in June 2021. I expect these trends to continue as restrictions are lifted in line with public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Support for SPSV operators continues to be available through a series of measures designed to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and I can confirm that they will be waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the Motor Tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website. The NTA has also extended age limits for SPSVs to 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Recognisng that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to\u00a0support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles, I increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme for 2021 to &euro;15 million, up from &euro;1 million. This scheme can be used in conjunction with COVID-19 investment and liquidity measures, such as the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme, which has received over 1,100 application. To date 254 vehicles have been licensed that were purchased under the scheme at a cost of just over &euro;3 million. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Microfinance Ireland announced on 9 September that a loan finance up to &euro;25,000 is now available to support the eSPSV Grant Scheme, as many SPSV owners are finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers.

The fleet is divided into three classes for the regulation of safety. These are the greater than 24m vessels which are regulated by means of an EU Directive since 1999. The next category are the 15m to 24m and these are not regulated at EU or international level and it is a matter for individual states to regulate these. In 2007 Ireland progressively introduced a safety regime for such vessels. The remaining sector are fishing vessel in the less then 15m category and these have been regulated since 2004 under national provisions.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;MFV Mary Kate&rdquo; was a fishing vessel in the 15m to 24 length category and was required to undergo its safety survey for compliance with the new safety regime in 2009. It was determined that it did not comply with the requirements specifically with the stability requirements and was not issued with a safety certificate. The owner then needed to propose how they would bring their vessel into compliance. The owner decided to lengthen the vessel by the inserting a new section into the vessel. This brought the vessel into the next length category of over 24m and the safety regime of that class applied. Following this alteration, the vessel was then found to comply\u00a0with the stability requirements. The vessel was subsequently sold to another owner on the Irish flag, has since been renamed and has been operating since this time under the new name and ownership.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013 the MSO brought a paper to the EU Regulatory Committee on maritime safety matters, the COSS committee. This paper was submitted to raise awareness among other EU Member States as well as the European Commission of the &ldquo;MFV Mary Kate&rdquo; case and possible safety implications for similar vessels which may be operating on the registers of other EU MS.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the European Fisheries Fund my Department has no role or function in relation to the funding of the fishing sector in Ireland.

Bus &Eacute;ireann also has a separate, commercially-run business, \"Expressway\", which operates a number of inter-regional bus routes in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenues.\u00a0 In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to ensure the continuation of PSO services throughout 2020 and 2021.\u00a0 In addition, the Government has recognised the impact of the pandemic on the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in June 2020 the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial supports for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.\u00a0 Among the commercially-operated routes that have qualified for support under the temporary scheme are most, but not all, of Bus &Eacute;ireann's \"Expressway\" services.\u00a0 \u00a0Notwithstanding these supports, though, the Covid situation has still had a profound impact on the company's financial situation, that the Board of the company is obliged to address. Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020. The decision impacts four routes - the X1 Dublin\/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020), the X12 Dublin\/Limerick service (which ceased operations on 30\/01\/2021), the 20\/X20 Dublin\/Galway service (which ceased operations on 28\/07\/2021) and the X8 Dublin\/Cork service (which ceased operations on 04\/09\/2021).  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services. In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X20 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X20 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route.<\/p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the Authority for reply.

My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date.

Saint David's National School and Rathmore National School in County Kildare were included as part of this initiative and have since been connected. Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Cill Cae, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Na Cloiche Moire, Killashee National School, Churchtown National School, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Naomh Iopseh, North Kildare Educate Together School, St Anne&rsquo;s National School and Kilberry National School are due to be connected in the coming months.

These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.\u00a0 The Effort Sharing Decision allows Member States to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. <\/p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published in June 2021 by the EPA, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could remain around 7% below 2005 levels by 2020. According to this report, Ireland will cumulatively exceed the carbon budget implied by our ESD targets by 12.2 Mt CO2 eq.,and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with these targets were in the region of &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required. However, due to the reduction in the amount of required credits to be purchased, and changes in CER prices in the market, this figure is likely to be significantly lower than the &euro;6 million lower end of the range.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets binding emission reduction targets for Member States for the period 2021-2030. The final agreement sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. However, it is important to note that this target will be amended following the European Council&rsquo;s decision to increase ambition from its existing EU-wide 2030 target of a 40% reduction to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target, including revising Member States&rsquo; annual targets from 2021-2030, were presented by the European Commission in July 2021.

This is similar to other ports in Ireland which receive no\u00a0Exchequer funding and must fund all their infrastructure developments through their own resources, borrowing or through EU grant funding.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in shipping services from Rosslare direct to the Continent as a result of Brexit. Rosslare reports huge demand for these services with an increase of around 400% in freight units through Rosslare when compared to the same period last year and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of these developments and to enhance Rosslare Europort&rsquo;s trade competitiveness, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort&rsquo;s strategic investment Masterplan for the port over the coming years has been completed.\u00a0 The Masterplan includes investment plans for &euro;42 million, which will be funded from the port's own revenues, over the period 2021-2026, in customer facilities, port infrastructure, freight facilities, port assets, new technology and linking the new entrance of the port with the proposed new port access road.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, to support the free flow of import and export trade through Rosslare to GB, there has been significant engagement, preparation and investment in the State Agency facilities required at Rosslare. Temporary Customs, Agriculture and Health facilities were constructed by OPW in the lead up to a possible no-deal Brexit in 2019. These facilities are located outside the port at Kilrane, on the N25 approaching Rosslare Town. These facilities are intended as interim facilities pending the construction of the permanent facilities within the port itself. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to liaise closely with other Government Departments and agencies, in particular OPW, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Revenue Commissioners, Department of Health, HSE and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and with Rosslare Port and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, in relation to the design and development of the permanent facilities. In August 2021, OPW \u00a0submitted a planning application to Wexford County Council in respect of these planned facilities. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This investment along with the Rosslare Europort Masterplan will ensure that the port is fully capable of meeting the controls required by the UK becoming a Third Country and of meeting the needs of future shipping capacity growth. Rosslare Europort and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are working together with the OPW on the coordination of works under both the port's Masterplan and OPW&rsquo;s own plans for the State border control facilities. The parallel plans will require close liaison to ensure that the port remains fully operational while construction works are ongoing. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to other business opportunities, Rosslare Europort have advised the Department that they are progressing their plans for the development of Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) facilities at the port and that they will be applying for Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding under the CEF call opening later this month.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to a free zone at Rosslare Europort, in discussions with officials, Rosslare Europort has advised that the idea is at an early concept stage in the port with the focus at the moment on progressing plans for ORE facilities. \u00a0Further work on the free zone proposal will be required by\u00a0 Rosslare Europort and\u00a0Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann setting out a worked out analysis of the benefits, if any, of any such proposal. <\/p>  <p>The development of a free zone at Rosslare would be a matter falling within the broad area of industrial policy and would require liaison between my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600082#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":437,"content":"<p>Question No. 173 answered with Question No. 172.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":438,"content":"<p>Question No. 174 answered with Question No. 172.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":439,"content":"<p>Question No. 175 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600083#WRJ00400"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[44265\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600083#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a driving test will be expedited for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>Under legislation, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) is the body responsible for the operation of the Driving Test.\u00a0<\/p><p>Individual appointments are an operational matter for the RSA and I do not have any role in this process.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050.  Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. <\/p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the\u00a02019 Climate Action Plan,\u00a0and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. <\/p><p>Considerable progress has been made, as a result of the work of the\u00a0Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy\u00a0will be\u00a0aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have\u00a0collectively contributed\u00a0to increased take up\u00a0of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 41,000 now. <\/p><p>In addition, my Department convened the\u00a0Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group\u00a0to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The\u00a0EVPP Working Group\u00a0comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group\u00a0were approved by Government today and the full report is now available online. <\/p><p>The Working Group examined the issue of price parity between EVs and ICE vehicles. The Report finds that there is divergence within the research community as to when TCO in economic terms cost parity will be achieved with some studies estimating that it is likely to occur in the middle of this decade, driven by falling battery prices and savings due to economies of scale, while others<b><sup><\/sup><\/b>argue that the cross-over point may not occur until towards the end of the decade. <\/p><p>In the meantime, in order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that: \u00a0<\/p><p>- The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and\/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and<\/p><p>- An Office for Low Emission Vehicles should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new Office should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. <\/p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of\u00a0electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is being kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. A new Climate Action Plan will be published shortly which will include actions to attempt to close the price gap between fossil fuel vehicles and electric vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600083#WRJ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600083#WRJ02800"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[44394\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600083#WRJ02900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding persons who obtained their driving licence for buses and lorries since 2013 and who are required to carry out a CPC course each year to renew their licence but in advance of this are required to do a theory test and do the procedures regarding theory tests apply to persons who had licences issued in earlier times that do not require the theory test;

Reports of suspected cases have been followed up and carcasses submitted to DAFM&rsquo;s Regional Veterinary Laboratories for testing. Although dedicated surveys have not been possible, the available evidence suggests that RHD2 remains primarily a disease of rabbits, with some limited spill-over into hares. Furthermore, the total number of reports has declined noticeably in 2021. On this basis there are grounds for some cautious optimism that RHD2 may not have the potentially significant impact on the hare population that was initially feared. The exclusion zone was reduced to reflect this reality. <\/p>  <p>   The limited data available does not indicate that a local outbreak of RHD2 in rabbits leads to an outbreak in hares in the area.

Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.<\/p>  <p>  The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), is Ireland&rsquo;s official standards body and is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. NSAI has produced additional guidance to some harmonised standards, under the CPR, in the form of Standard Recommendations (SRs) which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain construction products in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specification of concrete blocks, the relevant suite of harmonised standard facilitating specification of masonry units is the EN 771 (series). \u00a0&lsquo;I.S. EN 771-3:2011+A1:2015&rsquo; deals with aggregate concrete masonry units.

S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018\/AC: 2019 recommends the use of Category 1 aggregate concrete blocks, which requires independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks).<\/p>  <p>  In respect of specification of aggregates for concrete (including concrete blocks), NSAI has published &lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S.

Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 establishes an EU wide framework for market surveillance, and came into full effect in July 2021. This strengthens the existing provisions in the CPR (and other Union harmonisation legislation), relating to the compliance of products, the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on products entering the EU market.<\/p>  <p>  Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the \u00a0European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. DCC-NBCO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie. \u00a0Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise. <\/p>  <p>  Market surveillance activity should enable non-compliant products to be identified and kept\u00a0or taken off the market with unscrupulous and\/or criminal economic operators prosecuted and penalised for their actions. In this context, it is important to note that the overarching objective of a market surveillance authority is to ensure that compliant products are placed on the market. Where non-compliance is identified, market surveillance activities should be designed to encourage economic operators to take appropriate corrective actions to redress the position within a reasonable period of time. <\/p>  <p>  Market surveillance authorities have significant powers including to obtain access to the place of manufacture or storage, request technical information, select samples of the construction product and carry out evaluations, examination or tests on such samples.

I firmly believe that their level of pay does not reflect the value of the work practitioners do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. It also contributes to challenges of recruitment and retention of staff, which are key to the consistency of care provided to children, as the report notes.<\/p>  <p>  The State cannot determine wages in the sector as it is not the employer. However, I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and working conditions. That is why last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC\/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and Minister English has now accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. The Establishment Order came into effect at the beginning of July.\u00a0The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions for ELC and SAC. <\/p>  <p>  The report also highlights issues of\u00a0affordability and of the level of public investment in the sector. First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families,\u00a0commits to at least doubling investment in ELC and SAC in the decade to 2028. A key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State will be a new funding model. The new funding model will be the framework for additional investment in services in return for clear evidence of quality and affordability to ensure effective use of public funding. <\/p>  <p>  An Expert Group has been leading the work on developing this new funding model since 2019. The Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding, quality, economics, and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments who will be involved in implementing the new funding model. They have met eighteen times to date and it is expected that their report will be submitted in November 2021. It is anticipated that the Expert Group&rsquo;s work will inform the Budget 2022 process and my officials are already engaged in this. <\/p>  <p>  ELC and SAC services are private businesses and are free to set their own policies regarding the charging of fees and contract conditions. First 5 sets out, as part of the reform of the funding model, the development of an appropriate mechanism to control fees charged to parents in return for increased State investment in affordability, quality and sustainability. As set out in the Terms of Reference for the Expert Group, an essential and top priority for this Group will be to make recommendations for a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for ELC\/SAC. The Programme for Government sets out a commitment to examine the approach of other European countries to set a cap on parental fees, irrespective of income.<\/p>  <p>  The research partner for the funding model project, Frontier Economics, has produced eight working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues including international comparisons of fees and public investment, approaches to funding the ELC sector, and mechanisms to control fees charged to parents.

This commitment to improvement is underpinned by the current review which gives specific attention to children whose parents are not working or in education or training.<\/p>  <p>  The basis for the design of the National Childcare Scheme is provided in the 2016 Policy Paper on the Development of the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme. This informed the Childcare Support Act which was debated and progressed through both Houses of the Oireachtas in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Better outcomes for children is the primary objective both in the 2016 policy paper and the scheme design. The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.\u00a0\u00a0 These objectives are inherently interrelated and sustain each other.<\/p>  <p>  The policy was informed by national and international evidence and advocacy on measures to prevent poverty (including inter-generational poverty). The policy sought to strike the right balance between enabling early learning and care services or indeed school age childcare services, to meet the needs of children in terms of their positive development and tackling a significant contributor to poverty and poorer outcomes for children of non-work households.<\/p>  <p>  There is strong evidence that growing up in poverty has negative impacts on child outcomes. For example, according to the ESRI study Understanding Childhood Deprivation in Ireland (Watson et al., 2012), the longer-term impacts of poverty among children include lower levels of educational achievement, emotional and behavioural problems, and poorer health outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  The research evidence suggests that parental employment is a key factor in protecting children from poverty and deprivation. The ESRI \/ Watson study concluded that parental unemployment is a significant risk factor in determining deprivation rates among children, with particularly high deprivation rates where a parent has never worked, or in lone parent households, or where the mother has no educational qualifications.<\/p>  <p>  Childcare costs in Ireland (prior to the NCS) have been found to be a significant factor in contributing to low levels of participation in employment, education and training for mothers, particularly for lone parents. The NCS makes childcare much more affordable, and in some instances free to parents.<\/p>  <p>  The NCS policy paper highlighted the dangers of poverty traps in childcare schemes, particularly where there is a risk of steep rises in childcare costs where a parent returns to work. Such traps undermine the incentive to take-up or increase employment.\u00a0 Therefore the NCS was designed to counteract this disincentive effect, through a smooth taper rate across the income assessed subsidies, and also through a transition from unemployment to work\/study which increases the number of hours available.<\/p>  <p>  Research by Melhuish et al. (2015) and Sylva et al (2004), in the NCS policy paper indicates that positive children&rsquo;s outcomes are for the most part met through part-time participation. This research has been used internationally in the design of various interventions. (DCEDIY is extremely grateful to have one of those authors, Prof Melhuish from Oxford University, on the Funding Model Expert Group.) <\/p>  <p>  Melhuish and Sylva's research points to the fact that young children do not need to be in early learning and care for full time hours to meet their child development needs. As such, many schemes around the world are based on 15 to 20 hours per week. In Ireland's case, the State is now providing two years of free pre-school to all children before they start school for 15 hours per week. The NCS\u00a0 provides 20 hours of subsidised early learning and care per week where a parent is available at home, for children aged from six months, or 20 hours of school age childcare in non- term\/ non ECCE time. <\/p>  <p>  The OECD&rsquo;s 2017 study Faces of Joblessness in Ireland, which included an ex ante analysis of the impact of the National Childcare Scheme, stressed the impact of work incentives on joblessness. It reported positively on the likely impact of the NCS. <\/p>  <p>  Households on incomes of less than &euro;26,000 NET can access full subsidies of up to &euro;225 per child, per week, covering up to 45 hours week. To access 45 hours rather than 20 hours, the parent must be in some type of employment or be engaged in training. The definition of work or study is broad, covering all forms of work or study arrangements: full-time, part-time, week-on\/week-off and zero hour contracts.\u00a0 Moreover, the minimum hours required to engage in work or study to qualify for up to 45 hours per week is very low &ndash; at just two hours per week. In this way, the NCS encourages parents to exit poverty and deliver better outcomes for their children.<\/p>  <p>  For children living in exceptional circumstances of disadvantage or need, the NCS sponsorship arrangement is designed so that they can access free early learning and care or school age childcare for longer or full time hours where required. <\/p>  <p>  The DCEDIY is committed to keeping the scheme under review and to assess whether it is meeting its objectives. I have contracted Frontier Economics to undertake a review of the National Childcare Scheme in line with Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In conducting this review, I asked the consultant to give consideration to NCS and the application of a work-study test, which determines the number of subsidised hours of early learning and childcare a child may be eligible for under the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  This work is due to be finalised in the final quarter of this year and will inform in an evidence based manner the future development of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600090#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600090#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[44420\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021091600090#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will engage with the ECCE scheme service providers regarding the need to ensure that children who are not toilet trained will be allowed attend their cr&egrave;ches; if he will ensure that cr&egrave;ches have sufficient funding and resources to ensure that staff have time to take children out of the room to change nappies and also to install nappy changing facilities in cr&egrave;ches; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>Pre-school services are governed by Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and by the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016.<\/p><p>The minimum adult: child ratios for services providing full day care, part-time care and sessional care are set out in the these Regulations.

Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with\u00a0the Courts Service who inform me that the Wards of Court Office\u00a0operates family friendly measures with respect to minors. Each minor is assigned a case officer who liaises with the court appointed guardian. The case officer meets with the guardian to work through any requirements and provide assistance in terms of accommodation, care, health needs and access to services. The case officer in the Wards of Court Office also liaises directly with a case manager, overseeing the care of the minor on behalf of the guardian or parents, where one is appointed. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Wards of Court Office is cognisant of difficulties that can be encountered by the guardians of minor wards of court and always strives to ensure that they are dealt with sensitively with the minor's wellbeing at the centre of all considerations. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service advises that in a small number of cases, the General Solicitor is appointed as guardian of a minor by the court and the Wards of Court Office deals directly with the Office of the General Solicitor in those circumstances. The Office of the General Solicitor will liaise with the next of kin or care provider of the minor. <\/p>  <p>  Any concerns that a guardian has in relation to their dealings with the Wards of Court Office can also be addressed to the Registrar of Wards of Court or through the Courts Service customer&rsquo;s complaint procedure. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Family law reform is a major element of the Justice Plan 2021. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes in specialised centres. In September 2020,\u00a0Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. The General Scheme has\u00a0been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.\u00a0It should be noted that it is not intended that the Family Court Bill will make provision for matters relating to wards of court, be they children or adults.<\/p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.

Since 12 March 2020, over 125,000 COVID-19 related Vetting Applications have been processed and GNVB have been instrumental in supporting efforts to curb the impact of coronavirus across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout this period, GNVB has focused on ensuring that minimum disruption was caused to the vetting process for the 26,600 relevant organisations working with children and vulnerable persons across Ireland, despite the huge demands placed on the services of the GNVB.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that the GNVB has recently experienced a pent up demand from relevant organisations upon their resumption of services following the easing of restrictions. This has resulted in the GNVB receiving exceptionally large amounts of vetting applications within very short timeframes, as opposed to the more traditional spread of applications annually. <\/p>  <p>  This has caused larger than normal vetting applications to be in the system at the same time, and with other pressing demands, has extended the traditional turnaround times from 5 working days, to approximately 7\/8 working days for most applications.<\/p>  <p>  The GNVB has previously communicated with all of the relevant organisations to advise them of the current turnaround times and to assure them that the GNVB continues to process their vetting applications as expeditiously as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware,\u00a0Minister McEntee\u00a0announced in April, the establishment of an inter-departmental group to undertake a review of Garda vetting arrangements and legislation.

So, from 01 September 2020, the NRDO became the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO is overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer, where the National Rare Disease Plan is firmly embedded.<\/p>  <p>  Meetings to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, took place at\u00a0regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office.\u00a0 Continuing this practice, earlier this year (2021) I met with the HSE, The NRDO and The Rare Disease Taskforce and a very fruitful discussion was held regarding priority areas for the future in order to build on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan.

For example, the introduction of Checks by Monitoring (CbM) for the Protein Aid Scheme in 2021 is the first step in the implementation of the Area Monitoring System (AMS), which will be compulsory in the new CAP. CbM is an automated and continuous process which will use satellite data along with other data sources to determine the agricultural activity on all land parcels declared by farmers under the Protein Aid Scheme in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The use of satellite data and technologies such as AgriSnap, DAFM&rsquo;s geotagged photo app for Checks by Monitoring, will have significant benefits for farmers.
