A new roster was put in place in January 2019 following a Call for Volunteers which issued in July 2018.<\/p>  <p>  To date in 2019 members of that roster have participated in election observation missions in El Salvador, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Malawi, Moldova, Senegal and Ukraine. Roster members are also being nominated to participate in the forthcoming OSCE Election Observation Missions in Albania and Kazakhstan.<\/p>  <p>  39 observers have participated in these missions. This comprises 2 Long Term Observers and 37 Short Term Observers. The total cost to the Department to date is &euro;110,704.09. This cost represents the flight costs for OSCE missions, OSCE mission costs shared per observer contributing States which cover in-country costs such as drivers, fuel, interpreters, meals and accommodation, and the pre-departure expenses of &euro;600 which are paid to every observer who participates in a mission once in a 12 month period. This payment covers the cost of pre-departure medical visits, vaccinations, transport costs to the airport of departure, where relevant pre-departure hotel accommodation costs and other miscellaneous expenses.<\/p>  <p>  While serving members of staff of the Department are not excluded from applying to be members of the roster, they are not considered to be eligible for nomination to an overseas election observer mission while in the employ of the Department. One non-established member of staff was mustered to the current roster, but will not be considered eligible for nomination to a mission until a short-term contract of employment with the Department expires. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Director of a regional or thematic unit in the Department can nominate a desk officer from that unit to participate in a mission where it is directly relevant to their area of work. This would be an additional nomination to the roster nominations and these officials do not receive pre-departure expenses, which are only paid to roster members. For example, the First Secretary responsible for bilateral relations with Ukraine participated in the recent OSCE-ODIHR Election Observation in Ukraine. No other member of the Department's staff has participated in a mission to date in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It remains my intention that the names of the members of the new roster, and the names of those who participated in missions to date in 2019, will be released once security vetting is complete. Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Department cannot disclose the personal data of any member of the election observation roster without their specific, informed, unambigious and freely-given consent. There is of course a public interest in disclosing the names of roster members. For this reason, as roster members are being trained, the Department is seeking the consent of individual roster members to allow publication of the names of those on the current roster once security vetting is complete. This process is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Where a roster member with a disability requests that a reasonable accommodation be made to enable their participation in a mission, the Department&rsquo;s Elections Desk would liaise with the EU or OSCE-ODIHR, as appropriate, to see whether the arrangement could be facilitated, while also taking into account logistical, accommodation and security challenges on the ground.  No reasonable accommodation has been requested by any of those nominated thus far from the current roster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052900071#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052900071#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[23009\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052900071#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason funding is only provided to UN youth volunteers for 12 months; his plans to extend the period of funding for volunteers in the future to a two-year period similar to other countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade currently provides funding to UN Volunteers on an annual basis in line with our funding approach to other UN agencies.

Global GDP growth slowed sharply in late 2018 and early 2019, and is stabilising at a lower level.

These forecasts are in line with my Department&rsquo;s latest macroeconomic outlook, published in the <i>Stability Programme Update 2019<\/i>last month. <\/p><p>Escalating trade conflicts are negatively affecting the growth outlook in all countries.

The slowing world growth momentum and the implications for Ireland&rsquo;s economy, underline the importance of improving the resilience of the economy by building fiscal buffers and focussing on productivity and competitiveness. <\/p><p>The OECD Economic Outlook notes that the Government should remain committed to improving the public finances, but that it should stand ready to mitigate disruptive consequences if significant risks materialise, such as a disorderly conclusion of the Brexit negotiations. Government policy is consistent with this objective.

SNAs who are employed in a regular part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.<\/p><p>The current salary scales for Special Needs Assistants  are set out Department of Education and Skills circular  0071\/2018 &lsquo;REVISION OF SALARIES FOR SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS (SNAs) WITH EFFECT FROM 1 JANUARY 2019&rsquo;.<\/p><p>The position on working hours for SNAs is that there are no nationally set working hours for full-time SNAs. In this regard, the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005. The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;<\/p><p>  This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector (link below) specifically requires that SNAs are required to work the month of June on examinations and work appropriate to the grade including training. This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005. This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June. The utilisation of this period is not specifically for examinations or training purposes only, although these are two of the purposes for which the period of work can be utilised. <\/p><p>  Link to the SNA Contract of Employment for the Post Primary sector: Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12\/05 (Post-Primary) <i><\/i><\/p><p>  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs.

It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>The strength of the officially categorised Community Garda&iacute; in each station in the DMR North Division on the 30 April 2019, the latest date for which figures are currently available, as supplied by the Garda Commissioner is as set out in the following table. <\/p><p>The Garda strength of the Coolock District for 30 April 2019, as provided by the Commissioner, is in the following file.<\/p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link.<\/p><p><b>COMMUNITY GARDA 30\/04\/2019 <\/b><table><tr><th>DMR NORTH<\/th><th><div>INSPECTOR<\/div><\/th><th><div> SERGEANT<\/div><\/th><th><div>GARDA <\/div><\/th><th><div>TOTAL <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Balbriggan<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ballymun<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clontarf<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Coolock<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Howth<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Raheny<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Santry<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Skerries<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Swords<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>37<\/div><\/td><td><div>42<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>GARDA STATISTICS MONTH ENDING for D.M.R.

These regulations enable us to begin the long sought after quality assurance of school-age childcare services which is required to best serve children and families<\/p><p>In setting regulatory requirements, the primary consideration must be children&rsquo;s health, safety and well-being, and these were the primary factors considered when setting a minimum 1:12 adult-to-child ratio in the new Regulations for school-age childcare. The 1:12 ratio was selected following consultation with an expert group on school-age childcare standards, which included a range of sector representatives among its members. The working group report that was submitted to my Department in 2018 recommended a 1 adult to 11 children ratio. A 1:8 ratio was recommended in a 2005 working-group report. My Department ultimately decided on a 1:12 ratio.<\/p><p>I do not expect to see an overall reduction in the number of school-age childcare places as a result of the School-Age Childcare Regulations. In setting the ratio requirement, current practice was considered; while some providers have until now operated higher ratios than 1:12, many have operated lower ratios. The 1:12 ratio requirement is close to the working group recommendation, and while some individual services may have to recruit additional staff or reduce places (if they choose to keep their staffing level constant), this will not be true for all school-age childcare services. <\/p><p>  Nevertheless, following discussions with sector representatives, to give service providers time to adjust to the new requirement I made a decision earlier this year to delay the date on which the 1:12 ratio comes into force by 6 months, from 18th February to 18th August 2019. This decision recognised the difficulty for providers of adjusting their staffing ratio in the middle of the school year. If, in spite of the adjustment period for service providers, any parent finds it difficult securing a school-age childcare place for September, they should contact their local City \/ County Childcare Committee, which is available to support parents to locate childcare within their locality. Local contact details for City \/ County Childcare Committees can be found at www.myccc.ie.  <\/p><p>  The introduction of Regulations for school-age childcare is a new and important development. While the Regulations introduced this year are limited in scope, I intend to introduce comprehensive Regulations that build on the initial Regulations as well as on the recommendations made by the standards working group. <\/p><p>Public consultation is built into the process of developing these comprehensive Regulations for school-age childcare. On May 21st my Department launched the public consultation process. The consultation comprises an open call for submissions and an online public survey which are open until 5th July, as well as a focus group session with School Age Childcare Providers and an Open Policy Debate, both of which will take place in June.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 446,000 customers. The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;630 each year) from October to April, to over 375,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;240 million in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package. Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.  Carers Allowance is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance and there were no recent Budget changes that would have caused people in receipt of carers allowance to lose entitlement to fuel allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.

Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that since October 2013 the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.

However, I and my Department play a strongly supportive role, recognising the significant part that the built environment, planning and local government generally play in contributing to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets.  <\/p>  <p>  Through our building regulations, we are ensuring that homes in Ireland are built to the highest energy efficiency standards.  In relation to social housing specifically, funding of approximately &euro;128 million has been provided from 2013 to the end of 2018 to improve energy efficiency in almost 68,000 local authority homes. In addition, energy efficiency measures have been incorporated into over 9,000 vacant social housing units that have been returned to productive use since 2014. This effectively means that approximately 50% of our social housing stock have had improvements to their energy efficiency.<\/p>  <p>  To support the effort needed by the public sector to reach its target of a 33% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020, a Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy has been approved by Government and published by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. This Strategy contains a governance structure based around the designation of a senior manager as Energy Performance Officer (EPO) in each public sector body whose purpose is to provide oversight and strategic leadership on structured energy management within the organisation and to report to Government. My Department recently hosted a workshop with bodies and agencies under the aegis of the Department to provide an opportunity for each body and the group collectively to organise for performance and delivery of improved energy efficiency outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also playing a significant role in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s climate ambitions through the National Planning Framework (NPF), which was published in early 2018 as part of Project Ireland 2040.  The NPF sets out long-term policy for the future spatial pattern of development and urban structure in Ireland.  The national objective to transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society by 2050 is a key aspect of the NPF, particularly reflected in the &ldquo;compact growth&rdquo; objective of targeting a greater proportion of development to take place in settlements of all sizes, through urban infill and the re-use of brownfield lands.  The NPF operates horizontally across Government and will cascade vertically down through three Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs), to directly influence the operation of the planning system through the thirty-one local authority Development Plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052900076#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052900076#WRH01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Eligibility","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052900076#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[22900\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052900076#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if a person (details supplied) is eligible for inclusion in the turf cutting compensation scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>An application for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme was received by my Department from the individual referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.
