However, it is still good practice to use face coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus and in close proximity to others.  While the easing of restrictions removed the general requirement of for 2 metre physical distancing, public health advice continues to state that maintaining a distance from other people is good practice.  It is important that everybody in the parliamentary community continues to be respectful of other people's space.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.

Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.

We specialise in listings for dogs for sale and dogs for stud.  Dogs.ie has been online since 2008 and was set up to cater for the Irish people&rsquo;s great love of pet dogs.  It is estimated that our island is home to over 450,000 pet dogs, while there are also nine native Irish breeds of dogs that are recognised around the world for their beauty and excellent character.  Dogs rank as the number one pet in Irish households.<br\/><br\/>Since our foundation, the way Irish people have looked for pet dogs has undergone fundamental changes, including advertising moving primarily online.  Meanwhile, more recently, pet ownership numbers have also increased substantially since the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020.  Last month, February 2022, approximately 2,000 dogs and puppies were listed for sale on our site.  These advertisements are from private individuals, registered sellers of pets and registered breeding establishments.  Approximately 250,000 people visit our site each month.  They are generally looking to get general information on owning a dog, find a new pet dog, sell their dog or find a new sire or dam for their next litter.<br\/><br\/>In order to sell on our platform, all advertisements for dogs for sale are required to contain certain information, as per the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019.  This includes the date of birth, country of birth and microchip number, which has to be registered with one of the four approved dog identification databases, namely, Animark, Fido, the Irish Kennel Club and MicroDogID.  Advertisements must also include any relevant registrations or licence number, such as a registered seller ID from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or a registered breeding establishment licence number from one of the 31 local authorities.<br\/><br\/>At Dogs.ie, we pride ourselves in bringing a high level of trust and transparency to online pet sales.  We have some additional systems and rules that go beyond the legal requirement.  For example, all users are verified by SMS and only one phone number can be linked to a single account.  While it is possible to import dogs with cropped ears or doges that have been declawed, we do not accept these ads.  Puppies have to be at least seven weeks old before they can be advertised for sale on our site.  We limit certain payment methods from being used, such as virtual and prepaid credit cards and one-time credit card numbers.  For registered breeding establishments, we also include the number of breeding bitches included on their licence, helping to share the scale of these operations.<br\/><br\/>Beyond these measures, since 2020, we have been working closely together with Fido on ways to provide more transparency and trust in the information presented in our ads.  This work is largely based on a publication from Four Paws, entitled the Model Solution.  Four Paws is a global animal welfare organisation based in Austria.  One of its initiatives is to ensure that the owner of the dog is actually the person selling the dog, and that the details match the information contained on the microchip certificate.  This is where the Europetnet&rsquo;s Veripet<b><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font><\/b>system comes into play.  It works as follows.  Users enter the microchip number of the dog they would like to sell.  They also add in a unique owner PIN that is printed on each certificate.  The Europetnet&rsquo;s Veripet<b><\/b>system checks to see if the details match and if they do, it then sends the user a one-time passcode to the registered email address or phone number on the certificate in order to confirm ownership.  The Veripet<b><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font><\/b>system can also send back information about the dog.  Currently, we use this system to collect data on the sex of the dog, which avoids microchips being used for other dogs.  Finally, the Veripet<b><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font><\/b>system also provides a verification link for potential buyers to see certain information about the dog.  This link is added into the advertisement automatically and goes to the identification and registration database.  It should be noted, in relation to data protection and information about a dog, that its breed, date of birth, sex and colouring, are not relevant in a GDPR setting.  Since September 2021, when we launched this, over 5,000 of these verifications have been done.  This is approximately 35% of the dogs listed for sale.<br\/><br\/>On our site, we have three types of sellers, private individual sellers, registered sellers and registered breeding establishments.  Private individual sellers are people who sell fewer than six dogs a year.  Registered sellers are people who are registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They sell six or more dogs per calendar year, but have fewer than six breeding bitches.  Their registered seller ID is included in the ad.  There are approximately 1,400 individuals, charities and businesses currently registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and over 950 of them have an account with Dogs.ie.  Registered breeding establishments are those that are licensed by their local authority and have six or more breeding bitches.  Their number if the registered breeding establishment and the maximum number of breeding bitches as per the breeding establishment's licence are s included in the ad.  There are approximately 120 registered breeding establishments in Ireland, approximately 80 of which have an account with Dogs.ie.  <br\/><br\/>We also offer a free dog buying contract template to make sure all the right information is captured and exchanged when a dog is sold.  Trust, safety and transparency are paramount to us at Dogs.ie.  We want to make selling and buying dogs online safer for everyone.  Helping sellers to stay in compliance with their legal obligations is a critical component of this.  Each ad is carefully reviewed before being published on our platform.  Furthermore, we believe strongly in helping our pet rescues and charities around the country.  To assist in the fantastic work these organisations do, we offer support for rehoming charities, providing free accounts for them to advertise dogs for which they need assistance finding new homes.  With one in four households in Ireland estimated to be owners of dogs, we believe we can play a small role in helping the people of this island with their pets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to speak on the topic of verification systems used in online sales of pets, namely, pet dogs, subsequent to the introduction of the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019.  Fido is one of four databases approved by the Minister under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 for the registration and storage of the details of dogs, their owners and the identifying microchips of those dogs in Ireland.  Fido&rsquo;s work in this area predates the 2015 regulations by over a decade, and in almost 20 years of work, we have registered and stored the details of almost 1 million pets.<\/p> <p>  MODR 2015 is viewed across Europe as an excellent example of how mandatory identification and registration can be legislated for.  Several components of the regulations have made it a robust statute.  The absence of self-certification, the requirement of the database to time-stamp each transaction and record the details of the person entering the details, the requirement for photo ID and proof of address, and the fact that most data are veterinary certified have all contributed to high-quality data being collected.  Every year, thousands of dogs are reunited with their owners when they get lost because of microchips.<\/p> <p>  Fido has always worked extensively with animal welfare groups and charities.  As far back as 2013, we wrote the IT code for a system to provide for independent verification of advertised pets, as we were aware of the massive issues associated with the illegal puppy trade.  In the intervening years, and especially during Covid, these problems have got worse, with the cost of pups making puppy production incredibly lucrative.  Our verification system was presented to the Irish Pet Advertising Advisory Group, IPAAG, as far back as 2016, but none of the online advertising platforms introduced the system.  After the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations were introduced in 2019, the major online pet advertiser withdrew from the market.  Since then, Fido has collaborated with the current main online pet marketplace, Dogs.ie, to introduce the verification system.  As Mr. Savage said, it went live in November 2021.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is in a unique position in that we are the first country in Europe to have a statutory requirement for verification of the details of a dog being advertised for sale or supply.  There are several requirements now for advertising animals, but Fido's sole competency in this area is the verification of the microchip number, as Regulation 8(c) states that in the case of a dog, the unique code of the microchip implanted into the animal must be shown.<\/p><p>When the regulations were introduced, many advertisers simply put in fake microchip numbers, adding no improved traceability or transparency to the ads and doing little to improve consumer protection.  The Fido PetSAFE system had been developed to overcome this practice.<\/p><p> Anyone who has purchased anything online will most likely have used a two-step authentication system to pay for it.  This is where the purchaser's bank sends a verification link to the mobile phone number associated with the credit card account used to ensure that no fraud is being committed.  Veripet is a similar technology.  With the Veripet application programming interface, API, only the registered owner of a dog is allowed to advertise the dog for sale.  The registered owner's details have been independently verified and his or her proof of identity and proof of address have been seen, in most cases by a veterinary surgeon, and certified in the database.  When placing an advertisement on a participating classified ad site, the seller will need to provide the dog's microchip number along with his or her mobile phone number or email address.  The Veripet API will then carry out an automatic check with the pet registration database that the details match.  If they do, a one-time code will be sent to the registered owner of the dog and that code will need to be added to the advertisement in order for it to go live.<\/p><p> As for the detailed steps of how the technical system works, the pet owner or breeder registers the dog on a Department-approved database.  The pet owner visits a classified ad site, enters the microchip ID for the dog into the relevant field on the classified ad site, the microchip number for the dog is checked against the information on the database, and a one-time passcode is sent to the telephone number of the pet owner on the database.  The IT system developed by Fido has now been integrated into Europetnet to give a federated system across Europe.  This will go live in Switzerland in the coming months, with France, Norway and the UK also looking to implement it on the basis of its success in Ireland.<\/p><p> We have been presented with many reasons not to introduce this system by advertisers, but the technical solution provided by Fido has been extensively trialled live in the marketplace and is proven to work, with several thousand ads having now been verified.  GDPR concerns are dealt with at the advertisement platform level, which allows for the independently verified details stored on the database to be released to the new owner if there are problems with the pup and the new owner cannot contact the vendor.<\/p><p> Since implementation of the system, some issues have arisen.  First, there is little or no recognition by the public of the difference between a verified ad and a non-verified ad.  Second, no prominence is given to verified ads on sites, and there is little explanation of what this verification means and how it improves customer protection.  Third, Fido is the only database using this system, and that invariably leads to rogue breeders using other databases as it is easier to get their dogs posted on ad sites.  Fourth, some quality-of-data issues have been observed.  If the person registering the pup's details initially enters incorrect data such as an incorrect mobile phone number, the owner cannot receive the one-time passcode to allow the ad to be posted.  Fifth, other verification systems for non-Veripet verification are not robust.  They are subject to fraud, altered certs, old certs, reused certs and fake certs.  Sixth, other databases are not on board, and there appears to be no incentive to be on board the system.  In reality, there is no advantage to Fido in being on board.  Seventh, if there are different \"levels\" of verification available to prospective advertisers, the rogue producers will always gravitate to the easiest and least robust system.<\/p><p> It is not possible for an unregistered owner to advertise an animal on a marketplace that allows only ads that are verified through the system.  What we have found is that rogue breeders and those who want to circumvent the system will register their animals on a database that does not have the same controls in place.  Manual verification of these animals by the online advertiser is not robust and is easily circumvented by using old certs, falsified certs, previous owners' certs or other means.<\/p><p> The simplest solution is that advertisement sites publish only ads with microchips verified to the same level as Veripet, whether that is a voluntary code of practice decision or a legally mandated one.  Nothing in the current regulations compels the databases to provide this verification.  If, however, the online platforms did not allow non-verified ads to be posted, it would compel databases that are not on board to join the system because their clients, who will not be able to sell pets without proper verification, will demand that.  Manual authentication and verification is simply not robust enough to provide the verification that the spirit of the regulations sought.<\/p><p> The Veripet system works, and all adverts for dogs in Ireland should be verified through it, or through an authentication system with comparable levels of security, probity and transparency.  This will give consumers the protection they deserve when completing what can be expensive purchases.  We are always available to the committee to elaborate on any points about the system that may be unclear.  Again, I thank the committee members for their time.  Because of time pressures, we have kept much of the technical detail out of this presentation, but API documentation and further technical specifications are available should any member require them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Heslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Sorry, Mr. Heslin.

Does Mr. Heslin think the review of the microchip legislation needs to mandate that all the online sale platforms and all the databases that hold microchip numbers be uniform in what they are obliged to do?  If Mr. Heslin wishes to answer that question first, then I will come back in with some of my other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#C00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As I said, we have been working on this since 2013.  We were constantly producing code that allowed some form of verification and we used to present it to what was at that point the biggest marketplace in operation, and there was always a reason they did not want to implement it.  When the regulations came in there was even an argument as to whether or not an online platform was subject to these regulations at all.  We saw the laughable situation whereby microchip numbers that had been just pulled out of the air were used to facilitate the advertisement of pets.  There was no consumer protection in this.  With the Veripet system, it is now proven that there is a system that is instant and that works.  It is now being used across Europe, in much more complicated marketplaces than Ireland's, so the short answer to the Senator's question is \"absolutely\".  I do not know if there will be a voluntary code of practice that will compel enough of the databases to do this correctly and to the same level.  As for all the arguments against using a system, the coding is there, it is not difficult, it is not dear and very little needs to be done on the other end.  We have given this code to Europetnet, which is a non-governmental body based in Brussels, for roll-out across Europe, so there is nothing for Fido in this.  We just want to do the right thing.  The statistics to which Mr. Savage has alluded, with verification of 35% of dogs advertised, tell their own story.  That means that nothing in these regulations has contributed to an improved consumer protection for the 65% of people who have bought dogs via ads since November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Heslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>As for the 65%, one of the problems is that the Minister's response when we bring this up - and I have brought it up in the Seanad - is that the public need to do their homework and their research if they are going to buy a pup rather than going to a rescue.  The problem, however, is that they cannot do their research because they do not know what a proper microchip number or a proper dog breeding establishment, DBE, number looks like.  Even if they have the proper DBE number, they then have to try to find out information from the local authority, and not all the information is given.  My argument, therefore, is that buyers cannot do their homework if the online platforms do not do their homework.  In fairness to Dogs.ie, it is doing that in conjunction with Fido.<\/p> <p>  Other points have been made to us.  This probably has to be brought in across the board for the four different databases.  What information is contained on a Fido microchip?  Would Fido have any objection to increasing the amount of information on the microchips, whether the colouring, sex or age of the dog or where the dog was bred, if that information is available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#C00500","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>To be clear, a microchip is an inert piece of hardware and has only one piece of information on it, that is, a world-unique 15-digit code.<\/p><p>It is worthless to have that in a dog unless it is registered.<br\/><br\/>As to the details the Senator is looking for, we are mandated under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 to register, store and verify 13 different pieces of information associated with that ownership - the dog's colour, date of birth, sex, breed, markings, etc.  If Mr. Savage decided in the morning that <i>Dogs.ie<\/i>was going to integrate totally with our system, the owner would only have to type in the microchip number and verify it.  The system would then write the ad detailing from the independently verified details what dog was for sale.<br\/><br\/>A point that is often missed in this debate is that the quality of the data on databases is important.  In Ireland, we have predominantly chosen to use veterinary certified data.  As a vet, if I falsify data on the registered database, I could lose my licence.  That is a price I am not willing to pay, and few people are.  In the UK, owners can register data and there is no imperative to do it properly and give the dog's future owners any protection.  If the ad is run through our system, it means that a vet somewhere has certified that he or she has seen proof of ownership, a picture ID and a bill recording the address.  This was always the problem in the old days - a dog being picked up at the back of a pub car park and a mobile number that would ring out after the transaction had been finished.  That cannot happen.  If there is a contention subsequent to the purchase of the dog, the details on the database can be released to the new owner.  That is the GDPR consent for publication.  Those details have been certified by a vet under the regulations.  If there is anything wrong with those, the vet is the one who has to answer why.  It has been difficult to circumvent the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 because it is so robust.  This is one of the things we can bolt onto it to provide massive consumer protection and improvement in animal welfare, given that we will have good data.<br\/><br\/>What saddens many people involved in animal welfare - the Senator has campaigned on this matter - is that it is actually easy to get this right, to legislate or regulate, or to agree a voluntary code of practice among online platforms.  Our disappointment is that there is not public awareness of what verification involves and means.  Our verified ads do not even get prominence on <i>dogs.ie<\/i>.  We get a little tick.  Someone would need to go looking.  We all know that, when it comes to the purchase of a pup, emotion trumps any form of will to do due diligence.  As soon as someone sees the picture or the puppy, he or she is sold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Heslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Mr. Heslin would have no objection to the four databases having a central repository where the information would be accessible to the authorised authorities if, for example, a dog had to be reunited with its owner.

My point about the four databases here and whether a central database might be a better system is that there are many data on those four databases, which can communicate efficiently with the central database provided by the Government.  If, as we proposed last year, we coded for a centralised system, where all four would have a firewall, but there would be traceability across databases, there is a difficulty in that it should be independently hosted.  We would see the Department as being the best host.  We do not want to host it because, as the Deputy says, we have a vested interest.

The VCI is a statutory body set up under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, as amended, and is under the aegis of the Minister of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine.  The principal function of the council is to regulate the practise of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the Republic of Ireland in the interest of animal health and welfare and in the interest of veterinary public health.  The functions of the council include protection of the public through the supervision of veterinary education, the maintenance of the register of veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses, the registration of veterinary premises, and through disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct. <\/p> <p>  On ear cropping, the Veterinary Council has no authority or role in the oversight of canine welfare matters relating to this abhorrent and regrettable practice by non-registered persons, and this may be a matter more relevant to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p> <p>  Our submission to the committee makes reference to section 16 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which provides that a person shall not carry out or permit another person to carry out, on an animal, an operation or procedure which involves interference with, or the removal of, the sensitive tissue or the bone structure of the animal unless they are carried out for the purposes of veterinary treatment or unless they are procedures listed in regulations, that is, for long-term welfare or animal management benefits, control or reproduction or identification purposes.<\/p> <p>  It is not permissible even for a vet to perform ear cropping for aesthetic purposes.  If a veterinary practitioner performs ear cropping, he or she is committing an offence under the Act and may leave themselves open to prosecution and-or to disciplinary action before the VCI&rsquo;s fitness to practise committee. <\/p> <p>  Veterinary practitioners take an oath to join the register of veterinary practitioners in Ireland to act in the best interests of animal welfare and frequently advocate for animals throughout their careers.  Any act such as canine ear cropping would be liable to a finding of professional misconduct and-or disciplinary sanction if undertaken by a vet.  The veterinary council has never received a complaint relating to the involvement of any veterinary practitioner in commissioning such acts on an animal for aesthetic purposes in living history. <\/p> <p>  With regard to non-registered lay persons performing ear cropping, this is a matter on which the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine may wish to comment. <\/p> <p>  The council is the statutory body responsible for regulating the practise of veterinary medicine in the State.  The practise of veterinary medicine may only be carried out by a veterinary practitioner, suitably qualified and registered with the VCI, with some limited exceptions allowable in respect of research or such projects, authorised or licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA. <\/p> <p>  Pursuant to section 106 of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, as amended, the practice of veterinary medicine must only be undertaken from a premises for which a certificate of suitability has been issued by the VCI, a state premises, a premises such as a farm where care and treatment is being delivered to an animal under the care of a veterinary practitioner or from an exempted premises.  <\/p> <p>  The VCI maintains registers of veterinary practitioners, veterinary nurses and veterinary practice premises for which a certificate of suitability has been issued, following inspection by the council.<\/p> <p>  Section 53 of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 sets out that the practise of veterinary medicine includes diagnosing disease, injury, pain, deformity, defect or state of health of an animal, identifying and carrying out treatment, whether surgical or medical in nature, or any such matters, performing a surgical procedure on an animal, giving advice on the above and furnishing certificates on these.  For the avoidance of doubt, any invasive procedures, involving the entry to a body cavity, are acts of veterinary medicine confined to those persons qualified and eligible to practise veterinary medicine in Ireland, on the Register of Veterinary Practitioners, pursuant to section 53.  If an unauthorised or unqualified person carries out an act of veterinary medicine, he or she has committed an offence, contrary to the public interest and will be liable to prosecution by the VCI before the District Court.  Section 54, as amended, sets out offences in the practise of veterinary medicine or use of the title, which states that &ldquo;a person, other than a veterinary practitioner, shall not, do or perform any act, matter or thing, the doing or performance of which forms part of the practice of veterinary medicine&rdquo;. <\/p> <p>The term \"veterinary\" is protected and may only be used by those persons qualified, insured or indemnified, and authorised to practise veterinary medicine in the State. <\/p> <p>  Some of the services offered by canine fertility clinics, including artificial insemination, could constitute the practise of veterinary medicine.  Canine fertility clinics offering services such as taking blood samples, artificial insemination, semen analysis and diagnostic testing, without such services being delivered by a registered veterinary practitioner operating from a premises the subject of a certificate of suitability could be committing an offence and be liable to prosecution.  The veterinary council is the body tasked with acting in the interest of animal health and welfare and public health to ensure that services proffered in the delivery of veterinary care and treatment to animals are of a minimum standard, based on educational qualifications and continued professional development and competence, on which members of the public and animal owners can safely rely.<\/p><p>The Veterinary Council initiated nine authorised officer investigations in 2021, into matters requiring investigation in the public interest.  The Veterinary Council also initiated three sets of District Court proceedings in relation to matters regarding the practice of veterinary medicine, and the practice of veterinary medicine at or from an uncertified practice premises.  The Veterinary Council is active in its role of supervising the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in Ireland, including the initiation of investigation and legal proceedings where required.<\/p><p> It should be noted that some aspects of artificial insemination in greyhounds may be carried out by non-veterinarians, subject to licence and veterinary oversight.  This is provided for by the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005, as amended.  R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the licensing and enforcement of these regulations.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be better placed to speak to these regulations.<\/p><p> On canine artificial insemination and fertility clinics, the Veterinary Council currently has a number of investigations under way under Part 10 of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  These investigations are being carried out by authorised officers appointed by the council.  The investigations were initiated by the Veterinary Council in 2020 following concerns raised to the council about services that may infringe on the practice of veterinary medicine.  These investigations are under way with a report anticipated in early course.  Accordingly, the Veterinary Council can make no comment on any specific matters under consideration or investigation.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council collaborates with other agencies and, as required, can investigate any matter in tandem with other authorities or agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, local authorities, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We highlight that the Veterinary Council will always act in the best interests of animal health and welfare and public health in a reasonable and proportionate manner, discharging our duties as required through investigation or prosecution as appropriate in the public interest. <\/p><p> Statutory Instrument No. 63 of 2015, pursuant to the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, introduced a legal requirement for all dogs from March 2016 in Ireland to have a microchip.  The regulations set out requirements to have dogs microchipped and registered with dog identification databases, and confirm that those authorised to insert microchips are vets, veterinary nurses and other suitably trained persons.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council will continue to work to ensure that the high standards expected and enjoyed in the veterinary industry are upheld, and that the quality of veterinary care in Ireland is provided by those persons suitably qualified and authorised to deliver such services in the best interests of animal health and welfare, and the public interest.  The Veterinary Council will continue to be proactive in its investigation and prosecution, where necessary, of any matters contrary to the interests of animal health and welfare, and the public interest.  I thank the Chairman and the members for the invitation to address the committee today.  The president of the Veterinary Council, Vivienne Duggan, and I are happy to address any questions the committee may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Muldoon.

I am joined here this evening by my colleagues Dr. Patricia Reilly, deputy chief veterinary officer and current acting head of the Department's animal welfare division, and Dr. Mary McCarthy, principal officer in the animal health division.<\/p> <p>  The 2013 Act was introduced after much public and stakeholder consultation, and with the legislative expertise of many members of this committee, present and past.  The Act updated and consolidated legislation, modernising it in line with the knowledge and understanding of animal welfare.  It provided a regulatory framework for the welfare of all animals and assigned a science-specific responsibility for animal welfare policy to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It has provided a strong basis for many positive developments.  As our understanding of the welfare needs of animals expands, the legislative framework continues to accommodate the development of strategies and actions to further enhance animal welfare.<\/p> <p>  The Department has a strong history of supporting the welfare of animals.  Animal welfare has never been in a more important place in terms of policy, resources and practical implementation than it is now.  The 2013 Act enables the Department to regulate and support animal welfare through concrete tangible measures.   The Department has in excess of 200 authorised officers carrying out welfare inspections in every county, and they are out on the ground every day providing advice and support to the keepers of animals.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as inspectors from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, are also authorised under the 2013 Act.<\/p> <p>  The 2013 Act ensures that in addition to being able to offer their advice and expertise, authorised officers have the legal basis to issue improvement notices and compliance notices, which in the majority of cases are very effective.  People are rarely intentionally cruel or neglectful, and most animal welfare risks can be resolved before they become critical.  Where necessary, however, legal sanctions are imposed and prosecutions are taken when other efforts to ensure compliance have failed or there is a blatant disregard for an animal's welfare.  More than 100 successful prosecutions on behalf of the Minister have been taken to date under the 2013 Act, of which 72 relate to dogs.  A number of other investigations are ongoing.<\/p> <p>  Last year, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, launched Working Together for Animal Welfare - Ireland&rsquo;s Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025.  Ireland&rsquo;s first stand-alone animal welfare strategy is a living, action-focused document, responding to priorities raised by stakeholders during extensive dialogue and consultations, and reflecting the significant animal welfare commitments in the programme for Government.  Real progress has already been made.  Delivering on the strategy and in response to the programme for Government commitment to advance initiatives on responsible pet ownership, the Minister has established a new advisory council on companion animal welfare.  Independent members with a range of expertise and experience have been appointed.  The council is up and running and will advise on policy matters and, where appropriate, issue guidelines and recommendations in relation to companion animals.<\/p> <p>  The strategy acknowledges that animal welfare is a complex and evolving concept, which can mean different things to different people.  Perspectives on animal welfare are influenced by both science and values, which explains why there are often diverging views in society and sometimes between scientists.  This council, therefore, is a critical stakeholder grouping which will assist the Department in prioritising and advancing policy initiatives relating to companion animals.<\/p> <p>  Other key actions of the strategy include the establishment of the first chair in animal welfare and veterinary ethics at UCD's School of Veterinary Medicine; financial and policy support for excellent research that focuses on the \"one health, one welfare\" approach; and the development of initiatives to promote responsible animal and pet ownership, including through education.  The Minister has also refreshed and renewed the membership of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, FAWAC.  Since its establishment 20 years ago, the FAWAC has produced 17 detailed guidance documents and codes of practice.  It has also revised and expanded the early warning system, relaunching as the farmer and animal welfare network, which takes a \"one health, one welfare\" approach, acknowledging and emphasising the relationship between the well-being of people and animals.<\/p> <p>  The Department acknowledges the valuable work done by animal welfare organisations, and our officials work closely with many of them every day.  Since 2002, the Department has financially supported eligible NGOs.  What started as a modest scheme has grown exponentially, with record assistance of almost &euro;3.8 million awarded by the Minister to 98 animal welfare organisations last December.  Of this, almost &euro;2.7 million went to 68 organisations directly supporting canine welfare.  The Department is on track to meet the programme for Government commitment to double funding within two years, subject to the availability of Exchequer funding.  The Department&rsquo;s animal welfare grants support inspection, control, rescue and rehoming activities.   The Act has enabled the Minister to appoint as authorised officers under the Act a number of employees of certain animal welfare organisations, who have assisted with inspection and enforcement activities.  Nine of them are officers of the ISPCA, and five are officers of the DSPCA.  The Department liaises with other Government Departments and State bodies that have responsibilities relating to the control of animals, as well as with many stakeholder groups contributing to animal welfare initiatives.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the specific topics that the committee asked the Department to provide information on, beginning with the topic of canine fertility clinics and artificial insemination.  Many of the services offered by these clinics constitute the practice of veterinary medicine.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland is the statutory body responsible for regulating the practice of veterinary medicine in the State, as indicated by Ms Muldoon.  There is no legal requirement to approve or register canine germinal product establishments, and the Department does not maintain a list of canine fertility clinics.  The Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005 introduced a regulatory framework around the practice of artificial insemination in the greyhound industry and prescribed that the practice is licensed and subject to veterinary oversight.  R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann is responsible for these regulations and enforcement is carried out by the Irish Coursing Club.<\/p><p>Ear cropping is an unnecessary and painful mutilation that is already illegal in Ireland under section 16 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  Experts are united in their opposition to this practice.  There are no welfare benefits and many lifelong consequences for the animals, who frequently suffer permanent discomfort and recurrent infections.  This mutilation also has long-term detrimental effects on a dog&rsquo;s behaviour and ability to communicate.  Reports from animal welfare charities on the numbers of dogs with cropped ears being seized and surrendered suggest that, notwithstanding its illegality, the practice may be growing in Ireland and ownership of such a dog seems to be a status symbol in certain circles.<br\/><br\/>A number of challenges face us.  There is no law against owning a dog with cropped ears and the burden of proof in relation to where mutilation took place and who carried out the procedure is often difficult to establish.  In practice, authorised officers have no legal basis to seize dogs or otherwise sanction those in possession of such animals unless the owner admits to carrying out the procedure or having someone carry out the procedure on his or her behalf.<br\/><br\/>The Department, therefore, believes it is now necessary to revisit this legislation to support more effective investigation and enforcement and reduce the demand for dogs with cropped ears.On that basis, the Department is currently in the process of drafting legislation, which will be brought forward by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, in the coming months.<br\/><br\/>The Department has responsibility for the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015.  The primary policy objectives of this legislation were to protect the welfare of all dogs, assist in uniting stray dogs with their owners, act as a deterrent for those who abandon dogs and assist in identifying marauding dogs.  All dogs more than 12 weeks old must be microchipped and the possession, movement, sale or supply of unchipped dogs is an offence.  This helps ensure the security and improves the chance of the safe return of a dog that is stolen.  The system is effective in helping to reunite stray or lost dogs with their owners and is recognised among EU member states as an excellent model.<br\/><br\/>Data indicate a high level of compliance, with almost 600,000 dogs microchipped since 2017.  Database operators inform us that from their knowledge, all major breeders in Ireland are compliant.  Among the conditions of funding for recipients of the Department&rsquo;s animal welfare grants, animal welfare organisations must ensure all rescued and rehomed dogs are microchipped.<br\/><br\/>The four approved database operators are required to provide details of the microchip data they hold to Europetnet, a Europe-wide umbrella group of associations that register owner information for microchipped pets.  Europetnet is easy to use and the microchipping regulations can be enforced by any officer authorised under the Animal Health and Welfare Act, including officers of the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dog wardens, members of local authority veterinary services, customs agents and officers of the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA.<br\/><br\/>I re-emphasise that the Department operates a confidential, dedicated animal welfare helpline, through which members of the public can report concerns about the welfare of any animal by phone or email. The helpline can be contacted at a call save number, which I have provided in my submission, or by email at <i>animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie.<\/i>The Department received 881 reports in 2021, and 268 have been received so far this year.  Each report is followed up by a Department official or an ISPCA or DSPCA authorised officer.<br\/><br\/>By way of further background, I have provided an attachment for the committee summarising many of the animal welfare initiatives that have taken place since the implementation of the Act.  I hope I have given committee a good overview of the Department&rsquo;s responsibilities, commitments and actions in implementing the Animal Health and Welfare Act, particularly in respect of dogs.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Blake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Blake and Ms Muldoon to the committee.  Both of their reports were very comprehensive and extensive.  I thought they might have had an executive summary.  We have already read them but it is great to have.  I will start by saying I found Mr. Blake's briefing note especially helpful.  So much has been achieved.  I feel that is important to acknowledge.<\/p> <p>  I also acknowledge, of course, the absolute commitment of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, in terms of the stand-alone Working Together for Animal Welfare: Ireland&rsquo;s Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025 document.  It is something I do not think we have given enough attention to in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I acknowledge his absolute commitment and personal interest in it, which is to be welcomed.  I wish to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  I will take the witnesses through one or two comments and questions.  I will start with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Rather than criss-crossing, the witnesses might be able to share the questions or do whatever they think is appropriate.  I thank them again for their detailed submissions.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Blake said that perspectives on animal welfare are influenced by both science and values.  I thought that was interesting because it puts two different perspectives on it.  I am not asking Mr. Blake to comment but I thought it was well put.  I want to acknowledge that.  He might comment at some later stage because, again, I am only going to deal with issues he raised in his submission today rather than go off on a tangent.  He talked about the chair in animal welfare and veterinary ethics at UCD&rsquo;s school of veterinary medicine.  At some point, it would be helpful for the committee to have an update on that.  Someone might send us in something because that is exciting and has great potential.  The Department may perhaps forward details at some point.<\/p> <p>  I am a little bit concerned about a number of issues here.  Mr. Blake said, \"There is no legal requirement to approve or register canine germinal product establishments, and the Department does not maintain a list of canine fertility clinics.\"  I am somewhat shocked and surprised by that.  Mr. Blake might share his view on it.  Would he like that to change?  Does he have a strong recommendation on that?  I am somewhat surprised by that statement.  That is news to me.  He might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Blake said the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005 introduced a regulatory framework around the practice in the greyhound industry and that the practice is licensed and subject to veterinary oversight.  That is somewhat different.  We have two different regimes operating here, both with dogs.  He also said the regulation and enforcement is carried out by the Irish Coursing Club.  I am not sure if that is right or appropriate.  This is only a question.  I have no hard views on it.  I am somewhat surprised.  Is that the appropriate body for enforcing and monitoring this?  Does Mr. Blake have a particular view?  He might have no view, and that is fair enough.<\/p> <p>  Moving on, Mr. Blake noted reports from animal welfare charities on the numbers of dogs with cropped ears being seized and surrendered and the issue of illegality.  I know he cannot comment on specific cases but that is of concern.  Somebody is carrying out these practices.  Who is investigating them?  What sanctions are in place?  I know it is very hard to prove and all of that.  There may be a particular cohort of people who want to parade these dogs out in the streets.  Again, however, it is concerning.  Mr. Blake said the Minister may be bringing forward some legislation or regulation.  As chief veterinary officer, what would Mr. Blake's view be in addressing that?  He said the Department believes it is now necessary to revisit this legislation to support more effective investigation and enforcement in the area of cropped ears.  Mr. Blake might tease out what he is thinking there.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Blake concluded by saying that the Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline.  That is marvellous but I do not think enough people know about it.  I go to animal shows throughout the country.  We need to have a campaign.  I would like Mr. Blake to take that back to the officials in his Department to see how we can open a campaign with regard to this.  I do not know if people know about it.<\/p> <p>  I have been contacted about people keeping tropical and exotic animals such as parrots or reptiles in their gardens, which causes all sorts of problems.  When people try to talk about it, however, they are told not to in no uncertain terms, in unpleasant language, and are basically threatened with violence.  They are told that if they want to keep living next door to the owner of these animals, they must keep quiet.  That is not good enough.  People ask whether the confidential contact number is really confidential.  They ask if these guys can get at them or get their name under a freedom of information, FOI, request.  I am aware of one particular case where a person was told that he or she could be identified through an FOI request.  There is, therefore, much fear and intimidation around all this illegal or unmanaged activity.  It might not be all illegal but it is uncontrolled.  There are issues for animal welfare, nuisance behaviour and the residential amenities of people.  How do we safeguard that?  These are just issues Mr. Blake raised.<\/p> <p>  What is most alarming is that the Department received 881 complaint reports in 2021.  We now know that 268 complaints have been received in the first quarter of the year so far.  That is a considerable increase in only three months.  I would like Mr. Blake to comment on that.  As I said, he may not have a comment on all these issues.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  Ms Muldoon said the Veterinary Council initiated nine authorised officer investigations in 2021 into matters requiring investigation in the public interest and three sets of District Court proceedings.<\/p><p>What is happening?  They are a long time going.  What is the outcome of any of these?  Are these all ongoing investigations?  I want to hear what sanctions are in place.  We hear about investigations but we do not always hear the outcomes or, more important, the sanctions.  If they are live cases, clearly Mr. Blake cannot comment on them.  <\/p><p> It should be noted that some aspects of the artificial insemination in greyhounds, which is an area of real concern, may be carried out by non-veterinarians.  I presume the Veterinary Council has a very strong view on that; I would like the committee to hear that view.  There are issues around licensing and veterinary oversight.  People genuinely have concerns about this practice.  Do we need to beef or tidy up the legislation?  What are Mr. Blake&rsquo;s views?<\/p><p> I know I am asking many questions, but on fertility clinics and canine artificial insemination, the Veterinary Council currently has about ten investigations under way.  Again, these were under way in 2020, but this is 2022.  They are still under way &ndash; or are they not?  Mr. Blake identified that these were happening in 2020 and it is 2022 and he is not in a position to comment on them.  I respect that.  However, that says there is a problem.  If an investigation lasts two years, the likelihood of being successful in that investigation would be slightly hampered I would have thought, by just the time delays.  That concludes my commentary.<\/p><p> The issue, as I said, of regulating artificial insemination in animals, who is doing it and how it is managed, controlled and how all of that is accounted for is an area of serious concern and I do not have the answers.  I would like to hear what Mr. Blake thinks would be important in terms of beefing up the legislation in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#M00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>As the Senator said, he asked a lot of questions.

The Senator might let me know if there is something I forget.  He started off on the lack of need for registration of canine germinal products on premises.  The difference here is this applies to many of the farm animal species.  That has come through either historical or EU legislation.  The practice of artificial insemination in dogs does not have the same history and it is only becoming an issue that is actually hitting the public&rsquo;s and Department&rsquo;s attention in recent times.<\/p> <p>  As the Senator said, back in 2005 it was known and practised in the greyhound industry.  Legislative arrangements were put in place to control the use of artificial insemination in greyhounds.  This is an industry sport and it is run by a State body so it was important back then to ensure that there were parameters put around the use of artificial insemination in greyhounds.  I am afraid I cannot speak from that space myself, but I am assuming that was the reason that was put in place back at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Blake"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Mr. Blake can have a view on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#N00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>It is something worth now looking at in the context of the interest and reports we are getting in relation to artificial insemination in canines.

It is clearly banned in our Animal Health and Welfare Act and our subsequent statutory instruments.  As I said, it now appears from reports from our animal welfare charities that there are increasing numbers of these turning up in society.  In the context of control, I understand we had one successful prosecution some time back.  The difficulty is that unless one actually finds someone doing that, it is well-nigh impossible to actually build a case with sufficient evidence to prove it.  We do not have any ability to actually seize a dog whose ears have been cropped.  It is an issue in the context of trying to get that balance right in relation to the welfare of the animal.  Notwithstanding it might have gone through some pain and suffering with its ears being cropped, but the animal did no harm.

He made a few comments.  First, we had nine authorised officers investigations last year.  Where do they go and what happens to those investigations?  If and when a matter of concern is brought to the attention of the Veterinary Council, invariably, if it is credible, we will initiate an authorised officers investigation.  Those investigations are reported to the council.  If there is a matter to be followed up, that might lead to District Court proceedings, which is exactly what happened.  There would have been authorised officer investigations prior to the three sets of District Court proceedings initiated by the Veterinary Council.  Often, our authorised officer investigations will conclude that there is no matter of concern or evidence of any wrongdoing as such.  From time to time, there are matters of concern, and in that case, the Veterinary Council will take action, such as the three District Court prosecutions initiated last year.<\/p> <p>  Are all those matters concluded?  Yes, they are.  In two of those matters, the prosecution was success and a fine was imposed by the District Court.  In the third matter, the individual entered a guilty plea and ultimately mended their hand in relation to operating from a premise that had been certified by the Veterinary Council.  In that instance, the court accepted a donation to an animal welfare charity in lieu of a fine being imposed by the court.  Those are three instances where authorised officers investigations were carried through to decisive action by the Veterinary Council in the public interest and in the interest of animal health and welfare that lead to an outcome, be that a fine or conviction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033000002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting.

There were a handful of vets suspended both in 2020 and 2021.  All of those matters arise against vets where there has been a finding of professional misconduct, they travel through our own disciplinary procedures and a sanction would then be imposed by the Veterinary Council based on a finding of professional misconduct.  That would then be overseen by the High Court because that is dealing with the constitutional rights of an individual to earn a livelihood and to protect reputation and good name.  In the instances that I am talking about, that have been investigated by an authorised officer and then led to a District Court prosecution, there was one vet who was the subject of one of those prosecutions, which was related to operating from a veterinary practice premises that had not been certified by the Veterinary Council and the other matters were against individuals who were straying into the practice of veterinary medicine without being qualified, eligible or insured to do so.  <\/p> <p>  There are two very separate wings.

The proceedings of our Oireachtas committees will be conducted without the requirement for social distancing, with normal capacity in the committee rooms restored.  However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the opportunity to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online via Microsoft Teams.  All those attending in the committee room and environs should continue to wear masks, preferably of medical grade, over the mouth and nose.  They should continue to sanitise and wash their hands properly and often and to avail of sanitisers outside and inside the committee rooms, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend the meeting.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members, as they are aware, participating remotely must do so from within the Leinster House complex..  No apologies have been received.<\/p> <p>  Today we will discuss the general scheme of the personal injuries resolution board Bill 2022, which was recently referred to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Minister of State with responsibility for trade promotion, digital and company regulation, Deputy Robert Troy.  The Bill aims to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019 to increase the number of personal injury claims settled through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and to avoid the expense and time associated with litigation.  Due to the proposed expansion of the board's new remit and statutory functions to be conferred on it to resolve personal injury claims, the general scheme also provides for changing the name to the personal injuries resolution board.  Subject to the views of members I anticipate the committee may need to consult more interested parties on this matter ahead of preparing a report on the matter.  I am pleased we are able to consider the matter today and I welcome officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I welcome Mr. John Newham, assistant secretary in the commerce, competition and consumer division, Mr. John Maher, principal officer in the company law enforcement and personal injuries policy unit and Ms Anne Barrett, assistant principal officer in the company law enforcement and personal injuries policy unit.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I want to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction I may give.<\/p> <p>  The opening statement of the Department has been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. John Newham to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to discuss the general scheme of the personal injuries resolution board Bill 2022.  It is good to see the committee members in the flesh.  My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the scheme and to assist in any way we can.  The general scheme progresses commitments in the programme for Government and the action plan for insurance reform to enhance and reform PIAB.<\/p> <p>  Under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019, the board assesses claims for compensation arising from personal injuries following road traffic, workplace, or public liability accidents.  The board is not a court.  It does not make judgment on the issue of liability but assesses claims with reference to the personal injuries guidelines.  The board provides a service which assesses claims in a timely and cost-effective way.<\/p> <p>  There were approximately 21,000 applications for assessment in 2021.  Successive reports on the national claims information database by the Central Bank highlight the savings in both cost and time of settling through the board.  The most recent report published in November 2021 finds that average legal costs associated with settling motor claims through litigation were &euro;16,064 compared to average legal costs under the board of only &euro;841.  The time taken to resolve claims through litigation is on average 4.2 years while claims settled through the board average 2.3 years.<\/p> <p>  The policy objective of the general scheme is to amend the legislation to facilitate an increase in the number of personal injury claims that may be resolved through the board.  Encouraging greater use of PIAB will deliver cost savings in the personal injury claims environment and together with the implementation of the action plan for insurance reform will contribute to reductions in insurance premiums.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme consists of seven chapters and 27 heads of Bill.  Given the time limitation, I will summarise the key heads.  Chapter 1 provides standard provisions for the short Title of the Bill, commencement, and interpretation.  Chapter 2 provides that claimants provide their PPSN to the board when making an application.  This is intended to assist the prevention of fraud and identity theft and ensure accuracy in relation to payment.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 3 provides for mediation, which will be a new function for the board.  Mediation facilitated by the board will be a confidential and voluntary process between parties.  It is intended to facilitate an increase in the number of claims which can be settled without recourse to litigation, which is more expensive and takes longer.  Mediation has been used by the Residential Tenancies Board, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman as a way for parties to come to an agreed resolution.  The heads are modelled on existing legislation in respect of these bodies.<\/p> <p>  An agreement reached in mediation is binding on the parties.  Where both parties agree, the board will issue an order to pay and this will have the same standing as if it were a judgment of court, with the result that the personal injury claim is settled.  It is not open to either party to reopen the personal injury claim following a successful mediation.  Any failure to fulfil the order to pay can be pursued as a debt recovery case.  Mediation will not affect the timeline for the assessment of a claim.  The board will still be obliged to assess claims within nine months of the respondent's consent to assessment.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 4 contains amendments to some discretionary powers provided in section 17 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act.  Heads 15 and 16 will allow the board to assess injuries of a psychological nature and to retain cases where, based on the medical evidence, the prognosis cannot be determined within the statutory timelines.  The board has indicated these amendments could facilitate a 15% to 20% increase in the number of claims resolved through the board.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 5 deals with fee-making powers.  The board is funded through fees for its services, largely levied on insurance companies.  As the chief executive is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, it is considered appropriate that the board be empowered to propose and impose fees, albeit with the consent of the Minister.<\/p> <p>  Heads 20 and 21 set out that the board may apply an additional charge on a respondent who does not pay the respondent fee and for recovery of late payments.  These heads are intended to encourage compliance with the Act.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 6 and head 22 amend the Act to provide that where a respondent accepts the board's assessment but a claimant rejects it and the case proceeds to court and the court's award does not exceed the board's assessment, then the court will hold the claimant liable for the respondent's costs.  It provides that this will be the default position unless the court determines that holding this position would result in an injustice.  This is intended to enhance the board's principal function, which is to assess personal injury claims without the need for litigation and its associated costs.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 7 proposes a number of new functions for the board.  It enables the board to collect and publish information relating to personal injury claims, including information under the personal injuries guidelines.  It also enables the board to conduct and commission research and to raise awareness and communicate the benefits of its services.<\/p> <p>  Head 27 provides that the board may disclose information to any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if that information may relate to the commission of an offence other than an offence under the Act.<\/p><p> Finally, as the general scheme proposes to place an increased emphasis on the resolution of claims through an amended personal injuries framework which includes mediation, it is proposed to rename the board as the Personal Injuries Resolution Board.  My colleagues and I are happy to discuss the scheme in more detail with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Newham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Newham and invite the members to commence discussion with the Department officials.

Data protection will be absolutely essential in this area and it is important the necessary skills would be in place.

Therefore, we can see already in the data that are coming out of PIAB that the personal injuries guidelines have reduced the awards by about 40% and there should be a consequent reduction in premiums.  That is the expectation.  If we take, for example, the cost of taking a claim through litigation, in terms of the award, there is very little difference between the PIAB award and what you get if you settle outside of PIAB.  The difference is the cost of litigation.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure more of those cases are settled through PIAB, which should then mean the cost of claims is lower, the cost of litigation is lower and, therefore, that should help premiums.  That is where we are coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Obviously that will take a little time to filter through.

The staff of PIAB receive regular training and briefing on data protection in the claims handling process, and PIAB would compile a significant number of data protection impact assessments regarding their work, so there is a well-established data protection process in place.  In developing the general scheme, the Department will also work with the Data Protection Commission, DPC, and the Department of Social Protection to ensure data protection safeguards are in place.

With the area of data protection, it is probably every day of the week.  New skills probably need to be acquired every morning.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch briefly on the issue of mediation.  I am a big fan of mediation.  When it works, it works really well.  Head 8 refers to the benefits, which are extensive, and head 11 refers to staff and resources.  If it were a requirement in the morning to deliver on the resource capacity, what additional resources would be required?<\/p> <p>  In the heads it is stated that administrative tasks can be undertaken by existing personnel or what is referred to as external delivery partners, and in head 11 it is stated the organisation may be in a position to appoint external mediators.  I understand the concept of external mediators in the event that an organisation is overwhelmed and it is necessary to buy in additional resources.  However, there is a very clear benefit to having in-house mediators because they will build up that experience.  There is no guarantee when dealing with an outside company about what you will get.  Some mediators work in the area of relationships and they are not necessarily going to be the same people who could mediate a case like the one the witnesses are talking about, notwithstanding the fact they may have great skills.  There may not be the option, if outsourcing, to designate those skills specifically.  My concern is around the creation and retention of an organisational memory with regard to mediation.  It is a long time since I was involved in any mediation but I know the more you do, the better you get, the more you build up your knowledge and the better your outcomes.  The witnesses know themselves, when the mediation is finished, and while I know it is confidential, if people chat about it in any way, shape or form, they are not going to find that somebody else was perceived to have done better.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the resources that exist and that are needed and the reference to potentially outsourcing mediation or buying in additional resources, is that more in case of an emergency or would it be the intention that they would be the mainstay of the mediation?  I would have a difficulty with the second situation, but only from the reason of building up organisational knowledge.  Politically speaking, the witnesses probably know I would be opposed to outsourcing in any event, but that is not the reason.  It is to do with the depth and the capacity to build up that organisational knowledge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#B01000","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>To confirm, the intention is for PIAB staff to be the mediators.

One of the side effects of that reduction has been that a lot of the caseload has been moved from the higher courts into the lower courts, which in itself reduces the legal costs, so things are moving all the time and it is therefore difficult to compare one with the other.

I will group his questions as best I can.  If I have not responded to any question, I ask him to prompt me.  On mediation and how it can be done, we envisage it will be done quickly.  Its purpose is to get two parties into a room, thrash out the issues and try to resolve them.  It is envisaged that the process would not drag on for months and months.  Head 8 also provides that the board may abandon an attempt to resolve an issue via mediation.  If the board can see that there is deadlock or gridlock, it can decide that the process is not working and the claim will proceed to assessment.<\/p> <p>  On the cost element, as I said to Senator Crowe it is a much quicker process.  Even if people have legal representation, the costs should not be piling up in the same way as they would if people went into the High Court.<\/p> <p>  On reductions in premiums, there is a very clear correlation between compensation costs for claims and the cost of premiums.  We would assume that if they are dealt with through the PIAB process rather than going to litigation, they will be cheaper.  There should be a knock-on effect.  Similarly, the big game changer is personal injury guidelines.  Now the awards people receive from PIAB should be exactly the same as they would get if they went to court because both are using the same guidelines.  There should be no real differential between what people would expect to get through PIAB, a process which can be completed quickly, or what they can expect to get if they go all the way to the High Court.  We think that will have a dramatic impact on costs, but it will take time to bed in.<\/p> <p>  On what it means when PIAB retains a case, it means the case will not receive an authorisation to proceed to litigation, therefore people will have to stay with the PIAB process.  The point of this is that if medical evidence is not available to PIAB to assess a case, that same evidence will not be available to a court to assess the case.  Therefore, it makes more sense to keep a case within the PIAB process for a period of time for the injury to settle and, therefore, the claim can be settled through PIAB.  Again, it is about keeping cases out of the litigation process.  On heads 15 and 16, they are currently discretionary provisions.  We expect that where PIAB has the power to retain those cases, it will lead to an increase in such cases.  Have I missed any questions?

I will work backwards.  Mr. Newham set out the mediation piece.  Mediation is a closed box between the parties to agree whatever the issues are, with PIAB facilitating the resolution of issues.  No matter what we do, keeping it in the PIAB process will reduce costs.  It is going to be cheaper.  In terms of the larger claims, 70% of claims made to PIAB are in the motor sphere and of those, about 80% would be back- and neck-type of injuries that would have relatively speedy recovery times.  The awards reflect that.<\/p> <p>  The public liability is around 17% and the employer liability around 13% of the claims.  They would be the ones where there might be more serious injuries.  They would be reflected in the quantum.  As Mr. Newham said, sometimes there may be issues around liability and that is why the cases may proceed to a court and have a higher cost.  What we see at an aggregate level in the NCID are differentials between the cases that are settled pre-PIAB, immediately after PIAB and in litigation.  It shows very clearly that the PIAB and the cases immediately after PIAB are far cheaper that those that go all the way.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about the free bet and cases settling on the steps of the court, the parties have a right at any time in the process to resolve the matter themselves and settle.  Nothing can be done about that because that is a matter for the parties to agree.  Claims can be withdrawn from PIAB.  What we need to see in the coming years is cultural change.  We need to see respondents settling through PIAB.  We need to see consistency between what the courts are doing and what PIAB is doing.  We do not yet have the guidelines and the mediation in place and the courts are not yet making judgments on the guidelines because to a large extent the claims before the courts were instituted before the commencement of the guidelines.  There is, therefore, a time lag in terms of what we are seeing between the PIAB process and what is in the courts.  Mr. Newham referred to a chilling effect.  We think that when those legal challenges are concluded, we will have greater certainty in the injuries and claims environment.  That should contribute to lower costs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for coming in today and for the work they are doing on this.  Mr. Maher stated that the longer we keep people in PIAB, the better it is in terms of reducing costs to the Exchequer in terms of insurance.  I ask the witnesses to expand on two statements they made.  The issue relates to payouts for individuals.  If someone has an accident in a place of employment, as we heard today, the individual who is taking the claim does not need to worry about a reduced cost because it is done using the same system as the court uses.  The way we will reduce costs is in terms of legal fees.  To take the case of a person who owns a premises on which an accident happens, we have seen cases in the courts where the amount of money people have been awarded seems ridiculous.  For example, someone who falls and bruises a thumb can get thousands of euro.<\/p><p>I am referring to what occurs if PIAB assesses payouts in the same way as the courts.  A person in mediation could feel the claimant is getting away with more than he or she deserves, perhaps because he or she has a doctor's certificate or claims it is necessary to be out of work for three months or another period.  The person in mediation could feel it is unfair but could not really go to court because he or she would know that doing so would incur legal fees.  Therefore, whatever the agreement with PIAB, it would be very hard for a court payout to be lower &mdash; unless, of course, the case was won in court, which would be even tougher.<b><\/b>While it might be less for the person who owns the premises, he or she would still feel very aggrieved if the amount of money someone got was quite high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#E00700","speaker":"1629","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":283,"content":"<p>To unpack that a little, when we hear of court cases where the awards hit the headlines in the newspapers &mdash; quite often, they hit them because they are exceptional &mdash; we should note that any judgments made by the courts currently are in respect of the old system, which relates to the book of quantum.  They are not in respect of the personal injuries guidelines.  This is part of the rationale supporting the introduction of the personal injuries guidelines.  However, the Senator is right about one matter.  It depends on whether the respondent is insured and whether he is representing himself or the insurance company is stepping into the role of respondent, which adds a different dimension.  I say that because if the owner of the business is the respondent, the issue of liability might be more important to him or her.  In a mediation process, the owner can engage with the claimant and have a discussion, whereas, currently, through an assessment process, it is all offsite, with PIAB making the assessment.  The alternative is to proceed to litigation, which is through the lawyers.  There is a counterargument in that situation because mediation does allow what I describe.  If an owner in the circumstances in question rejects liability, a judgment is called for.  There is only one person who can make a judgment, namely a judge.  If the individual is insured, the insurance company will be taking other matters into consideration.  It will be looking at the calculator and making a call on the risk associated with proceeding to litigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Newham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I can see the point exactly.

For a long time, there has been an alternative process to solve the claims in that if someone fell in a pub, the pub owner would invite the individual to talk and offer a certain amount of money.  That happens quite a lot.  Do the delegates expect hoteliers, restaurateurs and pub owners, in whose premises accidents of the kind in question happen quite regularly, to consider the process we are discussing as opposed to offering a certain amount of money?  Do they believe the process will help a lot of people in the industry, especially in rural Ireland?  I am from Tipperary and note that there are pubs in small villages that do not have insurance at all because they cannot afford it.

The legislation is timely.  We are all aware of the significant problems that have existed in the insurance industry, particularly those faced by small and medium-sized businesses.  Runaway insurance claims and personal injuries claims, in particular, have become a scourge in business.  Anything that can be a bulwark against them has to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  Let me make a couple of points.  There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that nearly seven out of ten personal injuries claims go straight to the courts, bypassing PIAB.  This raises a question over the attachment of conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder to personal injuries claims.  Doing so leads to a much higher payout in the courts.  From a legal-fees perspective, there is good reason for going to the courts, particularly if one can get into the Circuit Court or High Court.  In the Circuit Court and High Court, fees can range between 30% and 60% of the final award.  Legal people probably try to push claimants to go to courts if they can at all.  The delegates say the mediation process they are highlighting is mandatory, but if I go through a mediation process with PIAB for four months and my legal team tells me it has a good chance of exceeding what I believe PIAB will offer, although the team believes it might not exceed it by more than &euro;500 or &euro;1,000, there is a very good reason for going to court: the claimant would not face costs.  Have the delegates considered examining historical awards where the settlement in the court was only marginally ahead of the PIAB recommendation?  I refer to examining where court costs were being awarded against the insurance company so as to determine whether we need a far larger quantum.  In other words, if I had a personal injury claim of &euro;10,000 and attracted &euro;10,000 in legal costs, should the personal-injury assessment by the courts not have been &euro;20,000, which is what it would have cost to finish out the claim?  Maybe the delegates would like to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on the confidentiality of PIAB mediation.  If one engages in a seven-month or eight-month process with PIAB and more or less knows what one will be offered and it is then decided to take the case to the courts, is there any danger that the information would be in the court domain or potentially available to anybody interacting with the case?<\/p><p>In other words, they may know if they can get a claim above that amount in the courts; I am not saying that they are able to speak to people but it creates an obvious question.<\/p><p> My third question relates to recurrent claimants who have been a significant feature in personal injury cases in this country, particularly against local authorities.  Has PIAB any function or mandate to start looking at how people can be so accident-prone and how families can keep receiving recurring payments over periods of years?  I ask that our guests might address those questions, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#F00600","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":289,"content":"<p>On the confidentiality issue and recurrent claimants, we are getting into the area of fraud and I will defer to my colleague on that point.<\/p> <p>  Dealing with the first question and working backwards, we looked at the aspect as to whether there is the setting of a percentage difference between what the award and what the final outcome is, and whether that can influence the process.  I will, again, ask Mr. Maher to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  To explain, mediation will be voluntary process, and is not, as the Deputy mentioned, mandatory.  We are proposing that it is voluntary as it has to be so.<\/p> <p>  PIAB needs to market itself because when one looks at the statistics and the level of awards being made by the courts even under the old system, which is the key thing, the claims did not end up much better.  Certain professions ended up better but the claims themselves did not and often the claimants had to wait much longer, 4.2 years on average.  Even under the old system, the PIAB process, on average, was much more effective in these terms.  That is why under the legislation there are provisions around PIAB conducting research and getting out there more.<\/p> <p>  The Personal Injuries Guidelines are the step change because the level of discretion under the old system has been narrowed under these guidelines and it is a great deal tighter.  I would certainly expect and I cannot see how there would be any difference under the Personal Injuries Guidelines between PIAB assessments, an outcome of mediation, and if a case went to full litigation.  I will leave the other questions for Mr. Maher to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022033000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Newham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  On the question of mediation, the general scheme provides that it is confidential and that there only very limited circumstances as to when the details of that can be disclosed.  It would not be the case that one would be going into court saying that a person had said this or that, as it would not work that way.<\/p> <p>  On the other question on the uplift and the need to beat the award by a certain amount, we certainly looked at that.  Three main issues arose.  First, what kind of percentage would this be?  Would it be 10%, 20% or 30%, as there is a type of arbitrary aspect to that?  The second and more fundamental issue is that the court is, by its constitution, independent and has to decide what that is.  We cannot put in an artificial bar to say that a court can only do this because then one would be effectively setting a bar and all anyone could do then was to go over the bar and we looked at the issue in that respect.  The third part on the repeat claimants is that we are providing within the Act that PIAB, where it sees fraud or suspected fraud, can report that to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I have a number of questions.  On head No. 22, and I am aware that others have raised this concern also, but on the fundamental and constitutional right of access to justice and to the courts, this head seems like an interference with the running of the court in some way in its directing a judge with respect to a costs order, if the ruling is the same as the PIAB ruling.  I raise that concern and seek greater clarification from the officials on that issue, please. <\/p> <p>  My main question relates to the mediation service and it is important to understand precisely how it will work.  First, how separate will the mediation service be from the rest of the assessment work within the personal injuries resolution board?  The proposed legislation speaks about officials within PIAB working in mediation but it is not clear how distinct or, indeed, how interconnected both the assessment service and the mediation service will be.  <\/p> <p>  Second, I am thinking about the person who is taking the claim and while, with good reason, there is a very significant concern about fraud and those who are taking repeated claims, on the other side of that we need to ensure that we fully protect those who are coming forward and have a legitimate injury.  What protections are they afforded in the mediation process and what supports are they given?  I see here that they are allowed to be accompanied by somebody, or perhaps a legal adviser, and I am just wondering if we are getting back then into the whole realm of additional costs.  This is important in understanding what supports are going to be there for the person bringing the claim and in understanding the mediation process because ultimately we may need to hardwire some of those supports into the legislation.<\/p> <p>  My apologies but I am conscious that I need to throw all of these questions, listen to our guests' replies and run to the Chamber then.  I very much welcome head No. 24, in respect of data collection, but I want to understand what type of data collection the legislation refers to.  Our guests spoke earlier about a lack of oversight in respect of awards being made in the District Court.  We know a little bit about what is happening in the Circuit Court but does the data collection extend to that?  Unless we fully understand what is happening in the courts we cannot properly compare with what is happening through this new personal injuries resolution board.

On her first point, on head No. 22 in respect of the courts, we modelled this on existing legislation, namely, the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  While it is, for want of a better description, refining the discretion available to the court, the court still has the power to state that in the proceedings, the costs are going to be awarded because the court feels that an injustice may have been done.  The court is still free to make that decision and it is provided for in the general scheme.<\/p> <p> On the separation of functions, the Senator is 100% correct, in that there has to be clear water between the mediation process and the assessment process.  That is something that PIAB will take forward in how that will work and be configured within the organisation.  It would not make sense if one was mediating on a case and that one would then go in and assess the same case, for example.<\/p><p>Therefore, there will be a very clear distinction between the mediation function that is undertaken and the assessment.

It is really important for it to make the data publicly available.  It has data on the types of accidents and the types of injuries.

That information can help with risk reduction.<\/p><p> PIAB has data that is almost complementary to what is in the NCID on claims, settlements, length of time etc.  Again, it is about PIAB using those data and publishing them regularly, thereby increasing information and transparency in the claims environment.

I am fully aware that I did not attend the European Council last week because I was a close contact of quite a number of people before I went and was concerned that I might test positive or develop symptoms while abroad.  However, I was at the General Affairs Council, which prepares the European Council.<\/p><p>I am very glad to have the opportunity to engage with committee members today regarding supporting Ukraine.  We now find ourselves nearly five weeks into the conflict.  The situation is of huge concern.  There are dire and unimaginable human consequences arising out of this illegal, unprovoked and unjustifiable large-scale invasion and war on Ukraine.  What we are seeing is, quite simply, incredible, except that we see it with our own eyes.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine is unwavering.  As the Taoiseach said in his conversation with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this reflects our close co-operation and support.  I know we are all looking forward to hearing from President Zelenskyy next week and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for inviting him to address both Houses of the Oireachtas, which is a singular honour and responsibility for us in our response to the situation.  <\/p><p>At this point it is worth recalling that Irish relations with Ukraine had started to develop last year to a greater degree than previously with the opening of our embassy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, visited Kyiv last summer to open the embassy and establish a diplomatic presence.  There was great interest and excitement within the Department and diplomatic community about this engagement and increasing engagement with Ukraine.  I had conversations with Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dmytro Kuleba, in December.  Even by then, there was huge concern as to what was about to unfold.<\/p><p>The focus of the engagement with the committee today will be what can be done to support Ukraine in an EU context, but of course it is also worth mentioning the United Nations.  Since the early days of the conflict, Ireland has been active and vocal in our support for Ukraine on the Security Council and in General Assembly meetings.  We have urged others to join us in condemning Russia&rsquo;s illegal, unprovoked and unjustified invasion and war in Ukraine, and we call on Russia to immediately withdraw its forces from the entire territory of Ukraine and to implement an immediate ceasefire.At this point, it might be worth remembering our ambassador and deputy permanent representative, Mr. Jim Kelly, who died suddenly and was to the fore in many engagements at the Security Council.  <\/p><p>Turning now to the EU, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership, which was made clear by the Taoiseach and has been gratefully received in Ukraine and many EU nations.  EU leaders acted quickly earlier this month and invited the European Commission to submit an opinion on Ukraine's application to become a member.  Even this procedure has been fast-tracked.  EU leaders reiterated that at the European Council last week.  Ireland has come together with a grouping of other member states that are similarly strongly supportive of Ukraine&rsquo;s application, with a view to providing political and practical assistance to support Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.  <\/p><p>In terms of funding, Ireland has contributed in full to the European Peace Facility&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion military assistance package for Ukraine.  Our total share, which is <i>pro rata<\/i>, is &euro;22 million, will go towards non-lethal elements.  The EU has also agreed to provide an emergency macro-financial assistance operation of &euro;1.2 billion in the form of loans to foster stability in Ukraine.  This is already being disbursed. <\/p><p>Ireland is supportive of the widest possible sanctions on Russia and Belarus, including on the energy sector, as a concrete demonstration of our solidarity with Ukraine and to maintain the strongest possible pressure on the Kremlin.  We are, of course, mindful of the need to maintain European unity.  The unity and determination of the EU took Russia by surprise and we must continue to hold a united and firm line on this.  I am pleased that we are doing that.  We and other member states have asked the European Commission to produce an impact assessment, looking at the effects of all the sanctions introduced to date on Russia and the EU.<\/p><p>On a humanitarian level, Ireland has responded quickly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.  An initial humanitarian package of &euro;10 million announced by the Taoiseach on the day of the invasion has since been doubled to &euro;20 million.  The humanitarian package of Irish Aid funding has been channelled to the UN, the Red Cross and civil society in general as they deliver life-saving help to Ukrainians affected by the conflict.  Some &euro;5 million of this funding will support UNHCR&rsquo;s refugee response, while a further &euro;6 million has been allocated to the Red Cross to support the critical role it is playing.  The International Committee of the Red Cross operates in active conflict areas, negotiating humanitarian access and safe passage, repairing critical infrastructure and ensuring the availability of life-saving care.  Of our funding, &euro;4 million will allow UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA to protect and provide vital medical care to vulnerable groups, whether they choose to leave or remain in their country.<\/p><p>Irish NGOs are also mobilising and partnering with local NGOs in the region.  Irish Aid will also support their efforts through a dedicated fund of &euro;2 million launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Colm Brophy, last week.  The EU, through the European Commission, has also made &euro;550 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance available.  The EU civil protection mechanism has also delivered almost &euro;300 million worth of in-kind assistance. <\/p><p>We are encouraging all our partners, including UN agencies and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, to mobilise the resources we provide by way of core funding to respond to the crisis in Ukraine and support host countries.  CERF has provided more than &euro;55 million to date, and Ireland is the tenth largest donor.<\/p><p> I will now touch on the recent General Affairs Council and the European Council, on which I am more than happy to answer questions.  I represented Ireland at a meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels last week.  Our main item of discussion was preparation for the European Council meeting of 24 and 25 March.  Other topics discussed included the revision of a regulation on the statute and funding of European political parties and foundations, the Conference on the Future of Europe, the European semester process for 2022 and an update on proposals for a regulation on the adoption of unilateral enforcement measures under the EU-UK withdrawal agreement.<\/p><p> At the European Council meeting, the main item of discussion was the situation in Ukraine.  Constructive discussions were held with US President Biden, in attendance physically, and the Ukrainian President, Mr. Zelenskyy, present online.  Leaders discussed Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, including the safety of the civilian population, help for refugees and support to the Ukrainian Government, and set out a number of conclusions that reiterated our support for Ukraine.<\/p><p> The European Council endorsed the strategic compass as part of its focus on security and defence issues.  Leaders also had a lengthy discussion on options to mitigate the impact of energy price increases.  On economic issues, leaders called for work to be taken forward on building a more robust economic base and reaffirmed the importance of realising the full potential of the Single Market.  As for external relations, preparation was made for the EU-China Summit, which takes place this week.  The political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina was also discussed.<\/p><p> Bheinn s&aacute;sta ceisteanna a th&oacute;g&aacute;il &oacute; bhaill an choiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#B00500","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I appreciate the update.  I know that many other wider EU matters were addressed at the General Affairs Council and the European Council, but I think we are all agreed that the biggest issue impacting all of Europe, particularly the EU, at present is Russia's ongoing brutal war in Ukraine.  At what stage does the EU think it will be in a position to evaluate the impact sanctions have had on Russia and whether they are playing as major a role as perhaps had been expected?  I appreciate that it might be a little premature to get a fair idea of that, but was it discussed?<\/p> <p>  As for Ukraine's accession to the EU, while the Minister of State mentioned Ireland's support alongside that of other member states, the question is what tangible support measures can be given.  The committee had a lengthy discussion with the Ukrainian ambassador a fortnight ago as to how Ukraine can achieve the Copenhagen criteria and the supports it would need in peacetime, let alone when the country is being bombed from a height by Russia.  In that regard, the Minister of State mentioned that Ireland is contributing a considerable amount to the European package, but we have decided not to contribute to the purchase of lethal or military equipment or aid.  Is that sustainable in the long term, particularly when it comes to the notion of solidarity within the European Union?

What plans may the Government have taken already to expel the Russian ambassador?  That is long overdue.  I fully accept the reasons the Taoiseach has given for the expulsion of those four diplomats, but I think many of us have been calling for the expulsion of many more.

The first few rounds of sanctions were done over a few days; that normally takes months.  A lot of work has been ongoing for a considerable period between the European Union and the United States in particular, working together.  A lot of technical work has to go on in respect of sanctions to get the correct names of companies etc.  Obviously, it all has to be legally watertight.  With other EU member states, we have asked the Commission to produce an impact assessment of the effect of sanctions not only on Russia but also on us.  There are questions and answers on the Commission's website, which will help companies understand their obligations.  The Commission will publish further information in due course.  There will be ongoing discussions on the mitigation of the effect of sanctions on EU member states to help preserve our unity because it is a fact that some countries are worse affected than others by the sanctions.  Some member states have significant trading relationships with Russia.  Things have changed, however.  I was talking to one colleague from one country - I will not say which country - that has a significant trading relationship with Russia.  Before Christmas, the country was very worried about sanctions in respect of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT.  Someone said to me that such sanctions would be the country's Brexit, such is SWIFT's impact there, if they were to go ahead.  After Christmas, however, and in the run-up to the war, that attitude had changed completely because people realised there was a very important moral principle at stake and a very important reality that if serious action were not taken, this could continue.  Therefore, I think there has been a change of focus in that some of these measures are viewed as simply necessary.<\/p><p>As for support for Ukraine's accession to the EU and measures needed to join the European Union, the most important thing we could have done in recent weeks was to send a signal of support and not a signal that could end in disappointment in Ukraine.  It was therefore really important for European leaders to have made the statement they made.  The Taoiseach was one of the first to voice support for EU membership for Ukraine.  If there were any ifs or buts to that, I think it would have sent a really negative message into Ukraine and maybe disheartened people because that is what they are fighting for.  We therefore thought it very important to state that we support absolutely Ukraine's accession.  That is long-standing Irish foreign policy and European policy.  The practicalities of that take a little time.  It will not happen overnight.  However, the Commission has now been asked in double-quick time to provide an assessment in respect of various countries, Ukraine in particular, of the applicant states' preparedness for accession.  Obviously, as Deputy Richmond mentioned, there are criteria in that regard.  The process takes time.  In the past it has taken years.  I do not think it will take that long in this case.  I maintain that the most important thing is that that positive signal is sent and that people are positive about this.  The people of Ukraine are part of the European family.  They are one of us.  They need and want to be in the European Union, and we certainly will not stand in their way.  In fairness to Ukraine, over time it had already made progress before the war on aligning with EU standards, and it is defending European Union values at the moment.  We will continue to support that and we will work as closely as possible but, obviously, the immediate priority is the humanitarian situation there and to try to get this war ended.<\/p><p>As for the European peace facility, it is not for me to answer the question of whether our position is sustainable.  That is for other observers to analyse and see whether we are right or wrong.  Even to have joined the European peace facility was a major step for the Irish Government.  Before this happened, some people would have questioned whether we would have vetoed this.  Of course, no Irish Government ever would in this context - let us be absolutely clear on that.  It was a very big step for us to take.  Even though we are providing non-lethal equipment to try to be true to our tradition of military neutrality and not being a part of military alliances, the help we are providing through the European peace facility is exactly <i>pro rata<\/i>with that provided by every other country.  We are also providing the defensive equipment Ukrainians need.  It has been a major step and a major help and has been acknowledged as such.  Whether that will change in the future is ultimately a matter for the Irish people.  We will leave it with the people in due course and will continue to give the practical help we are giving at present.<\/p><p>As for the Russian officials, each country has taken an independent decision as to what to do in this case.  The Government is advised by the Garda and the Defence Forces, and there is co-ordination and sharing of information around the European Union.  That is obvious.  We have taken a proportionate and appropriate decision, which has to be legally watertight under international law and the Vienna Convention.<\/p><p>Clearly, there were huge concerns with these particular individuals.  As I understand it, no government in the EU has expelled an ambassador.  It may happen in the future; I cannot predict these things.  It is considered that there is value in keeping lines of communication open, however flawed those lines of communication are, let us be honest.  The ambassador has not exactly given us much to go on in the past few months in making commitments that simply were not factual.  We have to maintain our presence in Moscow as well.  There are Irish citizens in Russia and they need help and support.  We also have interests to protect.  We have taken the decision.  It is a difficult balance to strike.  Early on, when this first became an issue, as a Government, we said we would rather do things in co-ordination with other EU member states.  That is what has happened.  It does have more impact.  It certainly makes a bigger splash.  I am glad there has not been criticism of the move to expel Russian diplomats, whereas there was in 2018, when we were accused of breaching neutrality.  The country has come a bit of a way since then.  It was the right decision.  These are difficult balancing acts; there is nothing easy in any of this.  The decision taken yesterday was balanced, proportionate and within the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#C00300","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I have a few quick questions and will follow up on some of the points made by my colleagues.  Regarding the impact of sanctions, Commissioner McGuinness said some time ago that the sanctions were having a crippling effect and the Russian economy was close to collapse.  We saw a 30% fall in the rouble and the protracted closure of the stock exchange.  I am interested in the Minister of State's assessment of the real impact.  Are the sanctions that have been put in place to date having that type of impact, or was the Commissioner's statement a little bit of hyperbole in terms of talking about the Russian economy being close to collapse without impacting on oil and gas payments?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the issue of the diplomats.  For a long time, there were very reliable security briefings for Government regarding the activities of a hugely disproportionate number of diplomats that are in Ireland for a country of our size.  I certainly welcome the action that was taken yesterday.  The Minister of State talked about it being a proportionate action, almost linked to taking a cross-European expulsion action in respect of Ukraine alone.  I am asking a more fundamental question.  Is it time, now, that we look at why a country of our size has 33 diplomats registered, given the security information we have that many of them are not complying with the diplomatic requirements under the Vienna Convention?  Is it the appropriate time to actually determine that the scale of the embassy representation in Ireland should be proportionate to the genuine expectation of diplomatic relations between our countries? <\/p> <p>  My final question relates to humanitarian aid.  I warmly welcome the explanation that the Minister of State has given for the &euro;20 million of humanitarian relief that has been channelled through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Food Programme.  My question is one that I am trying to develop a view on.  One of the things we want to do is to signal to countries that look to Europe for support and are being drawn, as it were, into the orbit of Russia, that we want to support the core activities of those governments.  I am thinking, in particular, of Moldova, which is very vulnerable.  It is surrounded, obviously, by Ukraine.  Our humanitarian relief seems to be going through agencies, which is very welcome.  However, as far as I am aware, none is going to the Moldovan Government itself, as an act of solidarity with it and a political signal, too.  Is it time for us to be also supporting the Moldovan Government directly not only to help in the humanitarian crisis that it is trying to deal with, but also as a political signal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#D00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will answer them in reverse order.  The Deputy is correct that we have given support to agencies that are working in Moldova.  There is a genuine interest from the Government in helping Moldova more generally.  There is comprehensive support from Government.  Before Christmas, I met the Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration, Nicu Popescu.  It was just a general \"get-to-know-you\" session.  Moldova has a very new, pro-European government.  As the Deputy said, they need practical help and also signals that we are with them.  Moldova is experiencing a very difficult economic situation.  Incredible support for Moldova has been provided through the EU.  We will continue to provide support.  The support that has been provided has been initial support.  Moldova has been landed with a crisis that is much greater than ours in dealing with the Ukrainian people who are there.  We have given significant support to agencies on the ground there that are doing work.  That is within the decision that has been taken.  We are absolutely open to directly helping the Moldovan Government.  There is no question about that.  I have made a commitment to the Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration and I have discussed it with the Taoiseach as well.  He is very interested in giving much more support to Moldova and in sending that signal.  We are very cognisant of the Moldovan community in Ireland, which is of great benefit to Ireland.  Many young working people have left Moldova.  We need to help Moldova as much as we can, and we are very interested in doing that.  There are many issues, not least the fact that there is a presence of Russian troops in part of the country, which is very difficult.  We are cognisant of that.  Indeed, I had a meeting in December with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, representative for Transnistria.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on diplomats, there are 19 Russian diplomats and 11 administrators in Ireland.  Four from that pool have been told to leave.  There are not 29 diplomats, as such.  I remind him that we brought in special planning legislation in the past year or two to directly ensure that the Russian embassy could not proceed with the planning for a particularly large building that it had planned on the site for national security reasons.  A diplomat was also expelled in 2018.  To be fair to the Government, the Russian embassy has been clearly on our radar over the past number of years.  This is not the first expulsion.  We had to bring in special planning legislation.  The embassy is very much on our radar.  In this particular case, an assessment has been made that the four people who are being expelled are not doing the work of diplomacy.  They are doing other work and they cannot remain in the country.  That is the assessment.  There is no doubt that this issue will continue to be looked at on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>  We have six people in Moscow in total.  That is a very small embassy for us.  Those people are doing essential work in difficult circumstances.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that sanctions are having a significant impact.  The sanctions target the Russian financial, energy, technology, defence and transport sectors.  We have seen a significant reduction in manufacturing capacity in Russia because of that.  Let us not forget that sanctions have also been introduced in Belarus.  It is also important to remember that the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, which are occupied by Russia, have also been subject to sanctions.  They have also been suffering because of this.  The media has also been suffering.  It is fair to say that it is not clear that the sanctions have resulted in a major shift in Russian actions.  We have seen that.  However, the economic impact has been dramatic.  We have seen the Russian rouble fluctuate.  There is no doubt that the continuing purchase of natural gas and oil is having an impact there, because they are not sanctioned.<\/p><p>Inflation in Russia, however, is at a high level and that is starting to have a major impact.  Unfortunately, it is affecting food prices and availability for ordinary people in Russia and that is Putin's fault.  The closure of EU airspace has had a dramatic effect.  People who even want to fly from Russia and Belarus to Kaliningrad, which is a Russian exclave, find it difficult.  It is hard to get to because they cannot fly over Lithuania, for example.  The Russian elite has also been badly impacted and we have seen some of them crying tears on television because of the unavailability of cleaners and other servants they are used to having, but they will just have to get used to this situation.  They will have to try to put pressure on, and continue to put pressure on, Putin to end this war.<\/p><p> Overall, the sanctions are having a major impact on Russia.  They will of course have an impact on us as well.  Nothing done in the context of Putin's actions will be cost free.  Discussions are taking place at the EU level regarding how to mitigate the effects on us.  Whatever the impact is on us, however, it is nothing like the cost being borne by the Ukrainian people.  The reason for these measures must never be forgotten: they exist because of Putin's war on Ukraine.  The war is having so many negative effects that it must end, and these sanctions are the weapon of choice of the EU and the western world.  We seek not to escalate things militarily, but to put as much economic pressure on Russia as is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#D00300","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I imagine the Minister of State is not going to go into any great detail, and perhaps he may not be aware of it, on why these Russian diplomats were expelled.  In the preliminary stages, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, said an examination of the diplomatic staff would be undertaken, I think he used the term \"operatives\".  I thought that was interesting.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the wider issue, there has been extensive commentary regarding why Russia has such a major diplomatic presence in Ireland.  One suggestion made was that, on some level, we are possibly a clearing house for espionage and industrial espionage operations across Europe, including the use of operatives who are termed \"illegals\".  It is fantastic stuff and I suppose everyone who has read a book by Frederick Forsyth now believes they are experts.  A wider issue is that we are one of the technology capitals of the world and our fear in this context relates to cyberattacks and hybrid threats.  What discussions has the Government had about this aspect?  Equally, what discussions have there been at the EU Council level and beyond regarding co-operation and being prepared for such eventualities?<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the sanctions, they are hurting and that is what we wanted them to do.  There is always the fear, though, that war economies seem to be able to survive much longer than we might anticipate.  The sanctions should be able to bite as much as is possible to force Putin to rethink continuing this war.  When Ambassador Gerasko appeared before this committee, she spoke about a list that had been given to the Department of Foreign Affairs of businesses still dealing with Russia.  I understand the complications in the context of the interconnectivity of the world economy, and it takes time to even explore all the machinations in the IFSC, but could we get an update regarding this aspect?<\/p> <p>  To address another topic, let us forget the rights and wrongs of being non-aligned and the issue of neutrality.  We saw what happened in the context of President Joe Biden's utterances at the weekend.  Fears have been expressed about moving the EU in the direction of being a military alliance, even by some people who have a greater interest in this happening than I do.  The worry about doing that now or even of putting the possibility of it happening on the agenda, is that it might become a difficulty in negotiations between President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian representatives and the Russians.  I refer to talk of neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#E00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648594800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I do not get the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#E00400","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Okay.  Let me put it this way.  Certain people would now like to see greater movement on military co-operation and even Ireland moving away from being non-aligned.  Whatever people's views in that regard, however, my difficulty and fear is that a line would be sold which states the EU is moving solidly towards being a military alliance and that perception then becomes part of a negotiating gambit in the talks between the Ukrainians and Russians.  I refer to this aspect as being something that could be used in that context.

It is fair to say, however, that the context for such debate has completely changed.  When it was a case of wars consisting of cavalry battles in Crimea and Ukraine in earlier times, we could stand back and be neutral about such battles on the field.  The reality now, though, is that this war is having a global effect and impacting us all.  I think it is fair to say that if neutrality means not taking a side, then the Irish people, overwhelmingly, have taken a side.  Therefore, I do not think we are neutral in this context at all.  Where our neutrality, as traditionally meant, comes in, is that, constitutionally, we cannot join a European defence pact.  We cannot do that and we are not going to do that, unless the Irish people change their minds.  NATO does not require a constitutional referendum but joining it has a similar status in the minds of the Irish people.

I recall he gave an interview, I think it was on the \"Today with Claire Byrne\" radio show one morning prior to the invasion and he was very downbeat and gloomy.  He had just come form various meetings throughout the European Union.  It was a chilling interview.  I do not think many of us realised that this was about to happen.  Certainly the sense the Minister of State got was that it was about to happen and all this came to pass.<\/p> <p>  On the strategic compass, which was agreed at the European Council meeting, obviously the French Presidency was very anxious to finalise this in the context of recent developments, including the position in Afghanistan, whereby the European Union could not get its citizens out of there following the US withdrawal of its troops, and cyber-attacks, which we discussed this morning.  I agree with the strategic compass and the moves by the European Union in regard to these matters.  Specifically on the rapid reaction force, what is Ireland's view of that?  Are we likely to participate in it?  If we do, will we participate on our own terms whereby we could have an opt-in and an opt-out.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s thinking on that as this matter evolves.  <\/p> <p>  My second question is on Ukraine's application for EU membership.  I agree that Ireland, in principle, supports enlargement and I agree with the Irish stance on Ukraine.  The Commission has been asked to report or to give an assessment on it.  When is that likely to be finalised?  When is the European Council likely to consider this further?  How urgent is that from the Commission&rsquo;s point of view.?  There is  opposition within the European Union by certain member states to Ukraine&rsquo;s membership.  I know the Minister of State has to be diplomatic but what is his understanding of the opposition to it.  I guess it is not talked about out loud.  Is it to do with the Balkan states and queue jumping, whereby states that have been in the queue for a long time feel they may be pushed down the list if Ukraine is fast-tracked or is it more to do with the strategic interests of various countries?  Insofar as he can, will the Minister of State outline what the opposition is to that or what the problems may be with regard to Ukraine&rsquo;s membership and getting agreement on it at the European Council and the European Parliament?  <\/p> <p>  My next question is on sanctions. The Minister of Sate said that Ireland supports energy being included in the sanctions.  There is a huge dependence by the European Union on imports of Russian oil, gas and coal.  I note there has been decisions made to decrease this dependence over the coming years from a strategic point of view.  How likely is it that energy will be included, or is it a question of decreasing our dependence and then including energy in the sanctions?  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s thinking on that.  Presumably there is fierce opposition again from certain member states to inlucidng energy.  Does the Minister of State think that is likely in the short or even the medium term?<\/p> <p>  I have a final question on the peace talks being chaired by Turkey, about which we heard a good deal on the news last night.  In the context of his experience on these matters, can we be hopeful about these peace talks and the various proposals put forward by Russia and Ukraine because that is the solution to all of this, to bring the war to an end.  Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s experience, does he think these peace talks being chaired by Turkey have a chance of succeeding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#F00700","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":380,"content":"<p>On the strategic compass, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was mianly dealing with that and it was agreed by the leaders last week.  Work on the strategic compass has been ongoing for a number of years and, to be fair, Ireland has had a big impact on drafting it and getting involved in the discussion.  To be clear, it is not a common European defence policy.  It is just to enable the EU to better anticipate threats, respond to crises and to deepen co-operation with partners.  In relation to any activity we take part in, such as the rapid deployment capacity, the triple lock applies.  Obviously, decisions will be taken on a case by case basis by Ireland in relation to that.  It is also important to remember that within the EU, even with the strategic compass, security and defence policy is a national competence.  This document and our own participation in the common security and defence policy does not overrule, prejudge or interfere with our own security and defence policy or that of any other member state.  It does not affect our traditional neutrality in any way.  It does not affect the triple lock.<\/p><p>In relation to my comments in January on the prospect of war, I will tell you honestly why I felt that was the case.  I was at the OSCE Ministerial Council meeting on 2 and 3 December in Stockholm and there were a number of things at that meeting that educated me about the situation.  There was a tension in the room, the likes of which I had never experienced in my life.  Minister Lavrov was there from Russia as well as Secrety of State Blinken and Minister Kuleba form Ukraine.  It was an extremely tense meeting. I also happened to have breakfast with the Ukrainian and Latvian foreign ministers the following morning and my eyes were opened at that point in early December.  We knew what was happening but I certainly came away from that meeting realising this was deadly serious and that anyone trying to play it down was not living in the world in which these people were living<b>.<\/b><\/p><p>That is what got me and my eyes were opened at that particular point and, unfortunately, for Ukraine, it has proved to be the case in the foresight of their leaders and neighbours.  They have certainly known the reality of Russian aggression.<\/p><p> I think it will be helpful if I can go briefly through the applications for membership.  These will go through a process with the Commission which we hope will be as quick as possible.  In the past it has taken years and these things are not rushed into.  In general, Irish policy is that we are very strong supporters of enlargement.  This year, we are beginning to celebrate the 50th anniversary of our membership.  The referendum took place on 10 May 1972 which we will be commemorating.  We joined the EU then on 1 January 1973.  We have seen the benefits of what we have received from the EU but we also see the benefits that we have brought to the EU because every country brings something to the table.  We are very strong that other countries should see the benefits of the social and economic progress that we have seen.  <\/p><p> There are different nuances around the table and while I will not mention individual countries, not everyone would share that view to the same degree as us but everybody wants to see peace and an expanded EU of countries that can be members of the EU.  The leaders have agreed in the Versailles Declaration on the position of Ukraine.  That was also a very significant moment and one that would not have been predicted before Christmas as these things are changing all of the time.  It was very important from our point of view that unity was achieved on the potential application for Ukraine.<\/p><p> We will certainly support the EU aspirations of Moldova and Georgia.  These countries have expressed their aspirations and have put in applications in the past while.  We will be urging their authorities to continue improvements and we note that the new government in Moldova is very positively disposed to the European identity which we want to encourage.  The Georgian Government also needs to work hard, particularly around the rule of law, an independent judiciary and good governance.<\/p><p> We have been very strong supporters of North Macedonia and its application for membership.  This country has done a serious amount of work to join the European Union.  Bulgaria has an issue with North Macedonia over the past number of years which has prevented progress on that file.  This concerns the issue of the language.  We have repeatedly asked these countries to deal with that issue bilaterally between themselves and we have given them the example of Northern Ireland where all sorts of intractable issues can be dealt with when parties just get together.  There has been progress and there has been a general election in Bulgaria where movement has taken place and we are certainly encouraging that.  We would hope that North Macedonia, in particular, can be moved on.  We are very strongly supportive of that country which has done so much to achieve this.  If Bulgaria can deal with and resolve this issue in a different way, that could happen, I hope, very quickly.<\/p><p> On Serbia, it is technically a frontrunner for EU accession but it needs to improve on reforms and respect for fundamental rights; it also needs to fully align with the common foreign policy of the European Union.  It has done that recently in votes at the UN but that has not always been the case.  It is making efforts from the point of view of the government but it needs to fully align with the EU&rsquo;s position on Russia.  It has not done this fully this time but pressure was applied at the UN and Serbia voted alongside us at the UN.  It does not have a sanctions regime in place, which is very significant for us, and for the people of Ukraine also.  We strongly encourage Serbia to continue in its reform path and to align with the European Union on all of these issues.<\/p><p> Montenegro is technically a frontrunner but there are difficulties and we will give whatever support we can to this country, as it moves on.  <\/p><p> Albania is similar to North Macedonia and it is tied in with that country.  The file will not move until the Bulgarian veto on North Macedonia is removed but once that happens I believe that Albania can move on very quickly and we will support that.<\/p><p> We wish the peace talks every success but one has to be sceptical about Russia.  We have seen it here on our own TV screens where Russia has said so much in the past which was not true.  It announced that it was leaving the Kyiv region but I understand that there were bombs there last night.  We take Russia&rsquo;s comments with a grain of salt and we judge on actions not on words.  We want peace and any talks can be positive.<\/p><p> Energy sanctions could happen but the key for the European Union is energy autonomy.  A great deal of work has been done to reduce the dependence on Russian oil and gas.  This, obviously, should have happened years ago but it is now happening.  The Commission published a document in March which outlined a plan to make us completely independent in a number of years.  A gas storage policy is being put in place and we are also looking at the joint purchase of gas in the same way that we did the vaccines.  In addition, in talking to colleagues around the European table, some of whom have also said publicly that they are scouring the world to try to find alternative supplies of gas, whether that is in Africa, Asia or indeed from the US.  We heard President Biden&rsquo;s announcement last week and a great deal of work is going on to eliminate that dependence on Russian oil and gas.  I do not know whether there will be sanctions in the meantime.  Ireland will support them if there is a proposal but it requires all of the member states to agree to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#F00800","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on leading out on that.<\/p> <p>  On some direct Ukraine issues, if this country&rsquo;s application had been with us before the invasion, it would have been asking the EU about rule of law issues in Poland and Hungary.  Given the extraordinarily generous response of Poland and Hungary to the situation, is there still an appetite to pursue the rule of law issues?<\/p> <p>  On the energy crisis, what positions are likely around the reduction of VAT to allow flexibility to member state governments to reduce VAT and taxation on energy prices?

Deputy Calleary is right in that the values of the European Union are what are important in any enlargement of the European Union and are key.  In the European Union one can basically vote for whoever one likes and say what one likes and there is respect for human rights.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting because when we joined 50 years ago there had to be a special Government decision to mandate that there would be equal pay between men and women.  The interesting thing about that, of course, is because it was the then Irish Commissioner, Patrick Hillery who went in and actually implemented that decision.  That was part of our change at that time and there have been ongoing changes since then.  All of these types of issues are still there with all of these applicant countries to ensure that they are fully aligned with European values.  Ukraine has shown that it is fully on board with European values.  It is a democracy which values a free media and we want to give it the strongest possible signal of support and to work with it on whatever issues are there.<\/p><p>Currently, the humanitarian crisis is the big issue.<\/p><p> The rule of law is still extremely important and it is why there is a process to join the European Union and ensure what we take for granted, such as an independent judiciary, a free media and democratic structures, are fully in place.  It means that when states are members of the European Union, they cannot backslide on such things.  One of the most important actions of every member state is that we submit to the European Commission every year for an examination of the state of the rule of law.  We then have a discussion at the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament also has a discussion.  Conferences are also organised on the different matters that arise.  Such discussions might include the digitalisation of the Courts Service or the reforms to the defamation laws that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is introducing.  We are working towards responding to some of those matters.  From an Irish perspective, we do not take umbrage when somebody points out a little thing here or there.  We try to do what is right and implement changes.<\/p><p> In the past couple of discussions about Hungary and Poland, I have been particularly conscious that Poland is now hosting over 2 million refugees from Ukraine.  It is doing incredible work.  Additionally, it has started to make some efforts around changes to its judiciary, although we will have to see the outcome of those efforts.  I acknowledge them nonetheless and I encourage Poland to continue that process, which is so important.  Ukraine wants what the European Union has and I believe Poland gets that.  That is the reality.<\/p><p> There are Article 7 procedures and the committee is aware of them and familiar with them.  They will continue.  It is difficult to get a concrete outcome from them but it is important to keep them on the table.  We fully support the rule of law budget mechanism recently approved by the court and we went to the court to support it.  I am very proud that Ireland did that.<\/p><p> There are serious issues in Hungary and there is no doubt about that.  It must engage constructively with the Commission.  Financial support can be withheld through the rule of law mechanism and we will see how that goes.  Both of those countries - Poland in particular but also Hungary - are on the front lines in helping people from Ukraine.  They need support for this but it does not take away from all other obligations to respect the rule of law.  That applies to each and every one of us.  Ireland will continue to be a very strong voice in that regard, watching progress, as we are in Poland, where it is happening to some extent.  We must ensure it happens and encourage the countries along that path.  We will keep doing that.<\/p><p> There are many things happening relating to energy prices.  I am not directly involved with the Government discussions on VAT with the Commission, which will be done through the Department of Finance.  They are ongoing and I hope the process will lead to a resolution that will be favourable to us.  However, we have introduced significant support here with the voucher or discount on the bills and the excise duty reduction.  That is significant in comparison to what the British have done, for example.  What is more important overall is getting that price down.  That will be done by sourcing gas from places other than Russia and trying to get a security of supply.  That is going on.  We must store more gas than we do now and have joint purchase of gas, which would give us more market power and, I hope, reduce the price.  It is also about moving to renewables because the European Union cannot continue as we are.  In heating our houses and putting on the lights, we are totally dependent on a major unfriendly power next to us.<\/p><p> The European Commission will come back in May with another report on the question of energy autonomy and prices.  We will see but there has already been significant work done on that which has brought outcomes.  The process will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#G00700","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>We covered much ground there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#H00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I may be one of the dissenting voices on the expulsion of the Russian diplomats yesterday.  It was the wrong movement from our Government because keeping the door open with Russia is important.  Does the Minister of State expect to see any retaliation from the Russians on that?<\/p> <p>  I see the Minister of State wished Turkey well in the peace talks.  The Minister of State is a leader in Ireland, which is a neutral country.  Have we reached out to all other neutral nations to see if we could be part of a process of putting together some groups to negotiate in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia?<\/p> <p>  I said the last time the committee met that we need some kind of Covid-style response within the European Union to this crisis.  There are over 6 million people displaced, which is a significant number.  I would like to see more work being done by Europe and more help coming from the EU to Ireland.  We are talking about taking in 200,000 people but we have very limited resources.  I do not know if the Minister of State has seen the photographs on social media of the tent-style housing being put up at Gormanston Camp at this point.  There are 2 million refugees in Poland and it has not put up any tented villages.  There are 500,000 refugees in Hungary and it has no tented villages either.  I am very much against putting up any emergency tented villages to house our refugees, even temporarily.  It seems the Hungarians and Polish are doing this better than we are for once.<\/p> <p>  It seems we waited nearly five weeks before we took action on Russian diplomats and a couple of dogs in Europe had to bark first before we started taking action yesterday.  We waited for others to act and then we acted simultaneously.

If people believe the diplomats should not be expelled, that is fine.  They are being expelled because the evidence available to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government was that they were not doing diplomatic work but were doing other work that was not compatible with the law.  We had no option in those circumstances but to expel those personnel.  It is the simple reason and such decisions are taken in consultation with the Garda, the Defence Forces and other European Union member states when we have such information.  In truth, when that kind of information comes to the Government, there is no option but to say that these people must go.  They cannot remain in the country.  It is a very serious action and this involved many diplomats being expelled.  They need to go.<\/p> <p>  There is no justification whatever for retaliation.  Our staff in Moscow do the ordinary work of diplomats, which is reporting back to Dublin what is happening and dealing with Irish citizens who, when they contact an embassy, are often in extreme distress or difficulty for various reasons.  Our staff in Moscow are doing this under very difficult circumstances and they are not doing anything incompatible with their diplomatic status.  Ireland has done nothing wrong.  It has never invaded any country whereas Russia has in this case.  We do not have spies or anybody doing work on a non-diplomatic basis in Moscow.  We all know the form of Russia in this case so we will see what happens.  Our staff do tremendous work in Russia in very small numbers.  The embassy in Moscow is tiny.<\/p> <p>  I wish anybody involved in peace talks well.  Turkey is not a neutral country and it is a member of NATO.  It has been very difficult for French President Macron to be on the phone constantly with Mr. Putin and listening to what he comes out with.  He has done it in the interests of peace.  He has done it on behalf of all of us as France has the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the time being.  It is an important voice and such work is important.<\/p><p>We are actively involved in discussions at the UN Security Council.  We have been extremely clear.  Russia needs to leave Ukraine.  It needs to take its army and soldiers and go home and tell the people the truth of what it has done.  This is wrong and needs to end.  That is where our strong voice has come in.  To anybody who is working towards peace, we wish them well.  It is very difficult to trust Russia.  We only trust it in terms of what it actually does, not by what it says.  <\/p><p> In terms of a Covid-style response, I agree.  There has been an extraordinary response from the European Union, running into billions of euro so far.  The European Union has been taking steps in the last few weeks that were completely unimaginable before Christmas.  It has brought the EU together.  That is very welcome.  We have sent out a signal that we are democratic, we support democracy and we want Ukraine to be fully part of that European family.<\/p><p> In Poland, the Deputy said there are no tented villages.  It is the depths of winter there.  They are using gymnasiums and church halls.  Poland does not have a supply of houses it can magic up for millions of people.  When he was in Poland two weeks ago the Minister, Deputy Coveney, visited a gymnasium where people were sleeping.  That is the accommodation they have there.  We probably both know Gormanston better than anyone.  That would be used if necessary.  It is clearly not what we want to do but the numbers are very high.  The numbers we have taken in so far are nothing really, compared with other countries.  It is part of a wider response.<\/p><p> It is also very important to remember that this is a temporary protection directive.  The idea of this is to give people temporary protection.  Almost everybody who has left Ukraine wants to go back home.  Why would they not?  Until now, Ukraine was quite a successful country.  There are stories of Russian soldiers coming into villages and being shocked by the standard of living compared to what they have in Russia.  Ukraine wants to improve on that standard of living.  People want to go back when it is safe to do so, to rebuild their country.  We will help them.  We have limited resources, as does every country.  I was talking to my ministerial counterpart in Rome, Vincenzo Amendola, and I asked him where were the Ukrainian people going who are arriving in Italy.  There are a lot of church properties, gymnasiums, halls and so on being used there as well.  I was reminded in Italy that there is a still a huge flow of people coming across the Mediterranean in very difficult circumstances.  They are coming from all sorts of countries through north Africa.  That is a very difficult situation.  They do not have the same rights as Ukrainians.  They have the right to apply for international protection if they are entitled to that but the temporary protection directive is there for the people of Ukraine in these particularly difficult circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022033000002#H00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>There has been a fair bit of discussion in the public domain about what is believed to have gone on or been run from the Russian embassy.  There is talk of illegals and running a degree of espionage or industrial espionage operations throughout Europe.  I am not expecting a comprehensive answer but is there any answer the Minister of State can give about that and the worries that exist around the Russian embassy at the minute?  I accept that it fits into some of our fears and worries as regards hybrid and cyber security.<\/p> <p>  When we had our meetings with the Moldovans, Georgians and Ukrainians, people got the idea of the Copenhagen criteria.  In fairness, the Minister of State has dealt with the significant issues, particularly in respect of rule of law.  We know the issues around Hungary.  Could there be a more straightforward roadmap and facilitation for them into the future?<\/p> <p>  On the question of Hungary and Poland, I assume on some level that Vladimir Putin has probably secured the future of the European Union and the whole idea of co-operation.  We probably had a very different interaction with the Polish ambassador than we would have had previously, given the work Poland is doing in dealing with the desperate refugee situation.  Has there been any movement from Poland since the invasion?  I would imagine it also recognises the necessity of Europe.  I am differentiating the Poles from Viktor Orb&aacute;n.  Even in respect of the latter, I assume there have been many conversations with him at a high level about the relationship with Vladimir Putin's Russia.  The Minister of State detailed a lot of information about the candidate countries seeking accession.  He spoke about Serbia.  Even individually, we here have had conversations with the likes of the Bosnian ambassador and others.  There is a belief that there are certain dangers in that part of the world and some of them have arisen, possibly due to Russian gamesmanship.  Has the conversation moved on?<\/p> <p>  On gas, people are seeking every source outside of Russia, which is absolutely necessary.  Am I correct in thinking there is a rationing deal across Europe such that if gas resources are depleted in the likes of Poland, everyone has to pony up?  At that stage, primacy would have to be given to electricity production so we could find ourselves not only with the difficulty of price but also a lack of supply.  I think everyone here is in absolute agreement that we need the European Union to come back with a positive result from the point of view of giving us some necessary levers on VAT.  The issue of supply is particularly concerning at this point.  I get that.  In the best-case scenario, we need to make maximum use of the renewables that are available to us.

My other deputy, Ms Derville Rowland, sends apologies as she is indisposed.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee.  I will begin by giving a brief overview of the economic outlook before discussing the changing financial system in Ireland and our new strategy, as well as outlining our regulatory priorities for the year.<\/p> <p>  A key component of the outlook we are all focused on is the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine.  I should start by saying that the economic consequences are very much a secondary consideration compared with the human consequences, the human suffering and the destruction and horrors we are witnessing in Ukraine.  It is a reminder that peace in Europe and being united in our diversity and our shared values is what the European Union is ultimately about.  Being part of the European system of central banks and the spirit and values it represents is something the Central Bank of Ireland is extremely proud of and very committed to.<\/p> <p>  On the outlook, the economy overall has proven resilient through Covid-19 and, prior to the war in Ukraine, robust growth was expected over the coming years.  A major factor behind the resilience of the economy in Ireland and across Europe and further afield has been the support provided by governments and policymakers to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.  Central banks across Europe and globally responded forcefully to ensure price and financial stability were maintained.<\/p> <p>  The strength of the recovery in the labour market in Ireland from the Covid-19 shock has been encouraging, as the standard International Labour Organization, ILO, rate of unemployment is now approximately 5%, with the Covid-adjusted rate at approximately 7%.<\/p> <p>  Regarding inflation, according to the latest available data, consumer price inflation in Ireland as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, rose to 5.7 % in February.  This is the highest rate of inflation since late 2000, and is in stark contrast to the experience over the decade preceding the onset of the pandemic, when inflation averaged 0.5%.  We know many people are feeling these very real price increases, in particular across their energy and fuel bills.  The current rates of inflation are driven by higher global energy prices and supply bottlenecks, with some knock-on implications of the energy price rise for the prices of other consumer goods and services.  It should be noted these increases in official consumer prices for energy and fuel are yet to reflect in full the developments of recent weeks and the implications of the conflict in Ukraine.  Neither do we understand yet the full impact of the latest increases in Covid case numbers across the world.  We are concerned at the impact of inflation.  From a euro area perspective, as a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, the experience in Ireland is similar to that across member states and indeed across the globe.<\/p> <p>  As for the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine, it is too early to give a definitive view.  It clearly represents a significant challenge to the outlook for inflation and growth and adds new uncertainty to what had started to become a less uncertain picture.  The war is likely to have a material impact on economic activity and inflation in the euro area.  In some countries, including Ireland, the effects will be more indirect than for others, although that does not mean they will be insignificant.  Of course, as far as inflation is concerned, the governing council will take whatever action is needed to fulfil the ECB&rsquo;s mandate to pursue price stability.<\/p> <p>  The financial landscape in Ireland has undergone significant change in recent years.  Ireland is seen as an attractive location for financial service providers to operate in, partly because we are part of the European Single Market but also because we are an open and globalised economy, have a skilled workforce, operate within the rule of law and have a supportive regulatory and policy environment.  The financial sector has seen significant change since the global financial crisis, with a reduction in the size of what might be described as the traditional sector and expansion elsewhere.  Since 2018, the growth of the financial sector has continued apace, coinciding with the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.  For example, since the second quarter of 2018, there has been 72% growth in assets under management in investment firms, 138% growth in the number of payment and e-money firms authorised by the Central Bank, 72% growth in fund service providers and 66% growth in the insurance sector.  More broadly, since 2016, the Irish market-based finance sector is increasingly outward looking, with greater exposures to the rest of the EU, the US and around the world, including the UK.<\/p> <p>  Technological change is disrupting the landscape of financial services, with new entrants, new business models, a race by incumbents to invest in developing the necessary capabilities, and in many cases the potential for a fundamental disruption in the value chain of traditional financial services firms and sectors.  This has impacted different sectors such as the retail banking sector, payment and e-money firms as well as new emerging areas such as crypto.<\/p> <p>  New payment methods and platforms bring challenges for the traditional role and dominance of banks in this area, while digital payment channels have lowered the barrier to entry for alternative providers.  We are also seeing increased new lending from non-bank lenders and retail credit firms, which offers customers increased choice.<\/p><p> Technology has meant the provision of many financial services can occur from non-traditional banks and this must be borne in mind when we consider competition in the market.  The new ways of accessing finance and the entry of new participants presents a challenge and an opportunity to incumbents to continue to innovate and meet the needs of consumers and businesses.  In regard to the retail banking sector we are inputting into the Department of Finance&rsquo;s review that addresses some of these issues.  As an open, engaged and future-focused regulator we seek to anticipate and support innovation in financial services and understand and adapt to the far-reaching changes taking place within the industry.  Our objective is to ensure the regulatory context enables the potential benefits of innovation for consumers, businesses and society to be realised, while the risks are effectively managed.<\/p><p> Innovation in financial services has the capacity to bring benefits for consumers, the economy and society in general.  However, while innovation is good, not all innovations are good, and not all good innovations are done well.  It is our responsibility to get the balance right that sees and supports the benefits of innovation in financial services for the economy and consumers, while also ensuring the stability of the system and that the interests of our own and other EU citizens are protected. <\/p><p> The rapidly-changing world of financial services sets the context for the Central Bank's new strategy.  The speed and scale of technological change, in particular, has brought significant opportunities that are matched by similar risks.  I believe the next decade will continue to be characterised by rapid change in our economies and in the financial system, driven by technology, by the need to respond to climate change, by an ageing society, and, perhaps most immediately by the move to different ways of working.  At the Central Bank we will need to accelerate our own pace of change to meet the challenges and the public&rsquo;s expectations of us.  We are facing a future of complexity and uncertainty but also of opportunity.  We will need to continue to evolve if we are to be front-footed in our response to these challenges.  Our strategy recognises the emerging context and the need to change the way we work and what we work on.  It also recognises that we are building from strong foundations.  The strategy&rsquo;s four connected themes represent a renewal and repositioning to ensure that our direction and ambitions over the next five years are responsive and forward looking.  The world in which we operate is changing rapidly.  The economy, the financial system and financial services and products are changing and will continue to change over the coming years.  We want to be future-focused and ready to deliver our mission through these changes and that will require a shift in our focus, our analysis and our frameworks.  It will also require a step-change in our engagement.  The rapid pace of change and the expectations of our stakeholders mean that we need to be well-connected with them.  It will require us to be open and engaged, explaining what we are doing and what we are not doing.  It will also require us to listen to individuals and businesses throughout the country so that we can understand the issues they are facing and help them to understand the actions we are taking in response.  <\/p><p> In a rapidly changing world we have to transform the way we operate if we are to succeed.  We will need to invest in new skills and capabilities, becoming more agile and looking for continuous improvement in the way we work to meet the challenges of an evolving financial system.  Our ability to turn data into information and to provide our people with the tools to use it effectively will be an important platform for our transformation.  <\/p><p> In regard to safeguarding, we will remain steadfast, working with our European colleagues, in particular, to maintain price stability and the stability of the financial system overall, as well as the effective regulation of financial services and markets.  The Central Bank is ultimately about its people and their skills, capabilities and commitment to work in the public interest.  I look forward to working with all of them as we meet the challenges ahead and deliver on our new strategy.  <\/p><p> Our regulatory priorities for the coming year support our new strategy and the need to respond to the dynamic and growing financial services system in Ireland.  Particular milestones in our work programme this year include: completing our framework review of the macroprudential mortgage measures; contributing to the European review of capital buffers for banks, including ensuring their usability in times of crisis, and concluding our own review of the bank capital framework; starting a comprehensive review of the consumer protection code by publishing a discussion paper and engaging widely with stakeholders on it; introducing new measures to address risks in Irish property; and putting in place a structured framework for engagement which will include an industry stakeholder forum, a financial system conference and a climate risk and sustainable finance forum.  We will continue to prioritise our authorisation work across multiple sectors, recognising the benefits of innovation, disruption and competition, but also the importance of protecting consumers of financial services and the importance of applying clear and consistent standards. <\/p><p> We will act across a number of initiatives to enhance the payments environment, including participating in the work on a digital euro, promoting low-cost instant payments domestically and across Europe and contributing to the review of the payment services directive, PSD2, and the functioning of open banking.  On the microprudential side, we will maintain our focus on the financial and operational resilience of the financial sector.  Key priorities here will include our work on stress testing and other financial resilience-related work across multiple sectors.  The supervision of business model and technology-related change will also be a priority as firms implement new technologies and respond to changing customer preferences.  We will maintain a continued focus on operational resilience, covering cyber-resilience, critical infrastructure and outsourcing.  <\/p><p> In line with our mandate for conduct and consumer protection, we will continue to drive for fair outcomes and for consumer and investor interests to be at the centre of financial services.  Our priorities include business interruption insurance, long-term mortgage arrears and oversight of the withdrawal of Ulster Bank and KBC from the Irish market.  We will also continue to enhance the reports from the national claims information database to support the wider policy agenda towards a better functioning non-life insurance sector.  We will also continue to step up our work on climate change to both ensure the financial system can support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and is suitably resilient to the risks.  This will include continuing to ensure that financial firms are adapting business models and building resilience in the face of growing climate and transition risks.  We will also focus on the development and marketing of \"green\" financial services products and services such that they are meeting high standards of quality and disclosure.  We will learn from and apply international best practices, including through our participation in the network for the greening of the financial system, NGFS.  More broadly, we will continue to evolve our regulatory frameworks and supervisory approaches to ensure the interests of citizens and the economy are well served by innovation in the financial sector.  This includes a review of our innovation hub that was set up four years ago to support engagement between the bank and innovators and has provided a valued and successful service.  In light of the changing landscape it is timely to review its functioning and consider any enhancements that could be made.  As we in the Central Bank look ahead to the challenges we face in the coming months and years, a determination to be future-focused, to be open to change and to different ways of thinking and doing, however uncomfortable it can sometimes feel,  will enable us to achieve the goals of our new strategy and to deliver our mandate. <\/p><p> In conclusion I will leave members with three points.  First, while there is significant uncertainty around the war in Ukraine, the path of the pandemic, and the persistence of inflation, the outlook for the economy remains broadly positive, notwithstanding the obvious headwinds.  Second, our regulatory approach aims to get the balance right between supporting innovation and change while safeguarding stability and protecting consumers.  Finally, our strategy represents a renewal and repositioning of the Central Bank to face the challenges of the future.  Ms Donnery and I will be happy to take your questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I welcome the Governor and his colleagues before the committee.<\/p><p>Since the departure of KBC Bank and Ulster Bank, many members of this committee have been concerned about the reduction in competition within the Irish banking sector.

When the governing council of the ECB met in December and announced it was going to cease its pandemic emergency purchase programme at the end of this month, that was a signal that we were starting to normalise monetary policy.  In my view, and that of the governing council, that process will be gradual rather than rapid.  When we met a few weeks ago, we took some further steps that reinforced the proposition that we would move gradually and look carefully at the data, the evidence of what was happening in the economy.  We reconfirmed that our asset purchase programme would end before interest rates went up.

There are other types of crypto that are backed, or alleged to be backed, by other assets and currencies.  They tend to be called stablecoins.

We had social welfare increases of 2.5% in the most recent budget.  Inflation is running at double that and will increase further before the end of the year.  Real inflation for people on social welfare is probably 1% higher than for those on the highest incomes in the State.  It is a technical debate but a very important one because policies flow from it.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the issue of tracker mortgages.  In July 2019, the Central Bank issued its final report on the matter.  There are still people going through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and finding that their cases are upheld.  I had a call this week with an individual whom I dealt with five years ago.  This committee has heard these points.  The current Chairperson was Chair of the committee then too.  The Central Bank came before us and said it had done its scrutiny and was leaving it at that.  We have had Padraic Kissane before us talking about people who were on discounted tracker rates and saying there is an issue there.  We have had the individuals affected themselves before the committee.  The individual with whom I had a call has had his mortgage sold on, and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has upheld the decision.  It is likely there are hundreds of others, if not more, who fall into that cohort, and they are not the only cohort.  We always talk about the 6,000 AIB customers whose cases were not captured by the Central Bank but were captured by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  There are other individual cases.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank has an agreement with the banks that when the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO, makes a ruling, the entire cohort affected will be looked at and the benefits of the ruling will flow to them.  I have two questions for the witnesses in that regard.  Has the Central Bank done any work on cases of discounted tracker mortgages, and does it need to take a second look at this?  It has missed cases that have resulted in serious financial hardship for individuals.  In some cases they are still losing their homes or their mortgages are being sold to vulture funds.  While the Central Bank washed its hands of this back in 2019, these individuals were left to paddle their own canoes and to take their cases to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  I would like a response to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#E00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>We have not washed our hands of this.

Our enforcement work continues.  Since 2019, we have had announcements of cases concluding, and those are not over yet.  The FSPO is still the right place to deal with individual cases.  I cannot comment directly on such cases, unless Ms Donnery has something to say.  If Deputy Doherty wishes to pick up this point in this session, we will be here after hours.  We remain pretty focused on the impact of tracker mortgages and that whole issue, but we think the types of cases we have seen recently are more appropriate to the FSPO.

I emphasise again that what happened was absolutely unacceptable.  The tracker mortgage investigation remains one of the largest investigative and supervisory pieces of work the Central Bank has ever done.  I am not familiar with the specifics of the case the Deputy mentioned but, as the Governor said, I think a number of individual cases are still going through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and we have a very good working relationship with the ombudsman in understanding what those issues are.  One of the things we found during the investigation was that while there were groups of borrowers in the way the Deputy has described, it was also the case that many different contracts were in place, with many different files, many different adaptations of contracts and so on.  There are therefore cases in which there are very specific circumstances or in which the dates on which particular contracts were put in place, for example, differ quite a bit.  I think that in a number of the cases that have gone to the ombudsman there are bespoke and individual circumstances.

It teamed up with lawyers and fought this individual tooth and nail over five years.  Then, when the individual wrote to the Central Bank, it handed back a letter saying it cannot comment on individual cases, even though it has a consumer protection role.  This fella took on a State-owned bank, in respect of which the Central Bank was supposed to do a supervisory audit to make sure cohorts such as his were not screwed over to the tune of tens of thousands of euro.  The Central Bank missed the case and left him on his own to fight it.  If he had not done so, many others potentially in the same boat would not have benefited and the bank would have got away with it.<\/p> <p>  There are two aspects to this.  First, there is a wider issue with the role of the Central Bank in being able to step in and take cases against the banks if need be.  We have seen that with insurance companies as well.  That mandate needs to change.  Second, this type of standard letter stating the Central Bank cannot comment on individual cases is not appropriate.  The letter should at least state the Central Bank will look at the person's case and make sure the bank, Permanent TSB in this case, has not done the same to hundreds if not thousands of other individuals.  The Central Bank did not even give that assurance, and that is not fair.  That supervision, that audit, was to identify the cohorts affected.<\/p> <p>  This issue has been raised with the committee by Padraic Kissane, witnesses themselves and members of the committee over and over again.  It has been raised with the Central Bank that there was an issue with discounted tracker rates in that, when the discount was over, the tracker rate was not there and the customer had to go onto a variable rate.  Despite the fact that banks got rid of tracker rates, they should have had that option to go back on the tracker.  That is what the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman found.  It is very annoying, and I get emotional about this, because I know the impact this has had on some of these individuals.  There are 250 complaints.  They may all be individuals.  Some of them may involve bigger cohorts.  Two hundred and fifty cases were made to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman on the tracker scandal last year, 12 years after this first emerged.  The Central Bank's role has to be different in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I will invite the witnesses to comment on that if they wish but I am conscious of the time so I will ask my final question.  It is about the issue of KBC and Ulster Bank withdrawing from the market.  As we know, Ulster Bank will write to its customers in the coming days.  We are talking about 916,000 accounts and 700,000 customers.  KBC will follow suit with 300,000 accounts.  That is more than a million customers impacted and the biggest shift in accounts in banks in the history of the State.  There is serious concern about that.  I am concerned, but I also heard from Mr. Colm Kincaid, director of consumer protection at the Central Bank, that banks are not yet where they need to be in preparing for the closure and migration of these customers' accounts.  I agree with that.  Are the withdrawing banks, Ulster Bank and KBC, where they need to be at present to support their customers?  If not, what will the Central Bank do about it?  Are the receiving banks, the likes of Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB, where they need to be to receive more than a million accounts over the coming months?  If not, what will the Central Bank do about it?  What is the Central Bank's assessment of the process at present?  Is there a dedicated unit within the Central Bank to oversee this process?  Has the Governor met with the CEOs of these banks to discuss this?  This is massive.

It should not be on the individual to close his or her account, to go across the road, wait for an appointment to open a new account, which we have heard can be three, four or five weeks away in some cases, and when the account is open, that individual has to go through every single direct debit and make sure he or she has switched it.<\/p> <p>  This involves 1 million accounts.

On the duty of care, what engagement has the Governor or his colleagues at the Central Bank, to whom I am very grateful for coming before us, had with the utility companies?  This is moving beyond the direct role of the banks.  One of the key issues, which Deputy Doherty alluded to, is the whole issue of direct debits and the fact that so many utility companies will only take instruction from the customer rather than the bank.  We are talking about 1 million accounts that contain multiple direct debits set up to pay not just mortgages but gas and electricity bills and Lord knows what else.  What level of engagement has there been?  Again, I have to come back to this point.

Surely the whole point of regulating the efficient departure, in due course, of two major banks from the Irish market is that this is a duty of care that must be adhered to.  I am very concerned about consumers, particularly the large number coming from Ulster Bank, who, through no fault of their own, will be constrained by the code in place.  They are trying to cover everything, and all of a sudden they find their lights turned off or they get arrears notices.  There is a need for a level of proactivity in this case when two banks of such a scale are departing the market.  Will the Central Bank engage with the utility companies?

We maintain a register of assets that have been frozen, because there is a requirement to notify us.  We consider applications for derogation, because that facility exists.

In some cases, however, it is not possible to determine what the cause or causes may be.

We have a fairly good understanding at the moment of what is driving current inflation in Ireland.  It is similar to what is driving much of the inflation across the euro area as a whole.  The main reasons are the supply bottlenecks that have essentially come out as a result of the pandemic.  What we have had over the past two years is an extraordinary period where economies were voluntarily closed down by governments.  We have now seen those restrictions lifted.  As a result, the accumulated savings households have made have been able to be spent and a lot of big demand for goods in particular appeared towards the back end of last year.  The demand for those goods could not easily be met as a result of what I described as supply bottlenecks.  To some extent, some of these were closer to blockages than bottlenecks.  It has taken a bit of time for supply in Asia, for example, to meet the demands in Europe.  Some of it is quite basic in the sense that shipping containers and ships were just unavailable or in the wrong places to transport the goods.  The lack of supply has been a very big driver in inflation.<\/p> <p>  Energy prices, again for similar reasons, largely as a result of supply bottlenecks, and this was before the war in Ukraine, were pushing up the price of inflation.  That is why the Deputy would have heard me and others at the ECB say we could see inflation coming down because we could see those bottlenecks over time getting addressed.

I think it is going to start coming down in the second half of this year.  It is, however, going to remain much higher than the forecasts we made back in December, for example.  That is certainly the case.<\/p> <p>  Economists tend to talk about inflation being driven by either demand-side or supply-side factors.

Obviously, it will make a difference to the profit of the banks.  The commercial banks will say they could not afford the same level of staffing as they had previously with the same number of branches open, but there is a problem and a downside.

Then there is another generation of people who, as Deputy Durkan says, want to go and talk to their bank manager about their future financial needs.  The system is in a state of transition and it is trying to work out what is the best equilibrium.  We are seeing the exit of big financial institutions, but we are also seeing the entry of new players.  They are different, and time will tell whether they are commercially as successful or not.  We are seeing change.  From the Central Bank's perspective, and going back to our strategy, the important thing is that we are ready to supervise and regulate whatever it is that the financial system ultimately develops into.  The one thing we can probably be very confident on is that the status quo is not going to continue; change is absolutely coming.

One relates to the financial crash.  The banks were in a position to be able to do something about it.  The Central Bank allowed the banks to continue to lend incessantly, against fresh air, for want of a better description, as someone commented recently.  In other words, there was insufficient collateral to underwrite the level of lending, which was unwise lending, and the Central Bank allowed it to go ahead.  As a result, the customer was punished.  I, like other members of the committee, have dealt with individuals who found themselves in serious financial difficulty and being told by the banks in the context of a resolution that they were very sorry but they could not accept it and that the loan was unsustainable.  The loan was unsustainable on the day it was granted because no provision was made for inflation, rising costs in general, or stability.  The customer got hammered.<\/p> <p>  The most recent examples I see relate to housing.  Housing prices are now accelerating at an appalling rate.  Vulture funds have got involved between the consumer and the provider.  The lending banks can borrow money at a very low interest rate on the European markets.  A means can and should be found to ensure that the intervention of various funds does not increase the price of houses.  I will finish on this point.  There is a responsibility on the Central Bank in this area.  There is no doubt in my mind about that, because the outcome is staring us in the face.  It is at the point now where the consumer, the customers, are being asked to pay through the nose for something where the actual cost and value initially was a small sum until investors got involved.  I know that there was a necessity for investors.  There was nothing happening in the country before that, but we must approach everything on the basis of the most recent experiences and what we have to do now in order to reassure those unfortunate customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#H00800","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, I have five Deputies offering and we are due to end this session of the meeting at 3 p.m. and to have a short break before the next session.

I might just give the two questions in full and then come back as that will probably be the quickest way.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  My first question relates to the Russian entities and the financial sanctions.  The Central Bank's recent analysis of direct financial links to Russia by the financial sector here showed that the IFSC-based special purpose vehicles, SPVs, held approximately &euro;37 billion in assets relating to Russian companies.  We know that a prominent Russian state-owned company raised funds in the IFSC a number of years ago during an earlier round of sanctions.  How will we be able to prevent this from happening again?  What we do not want is that we function as some sort of a conduit jurisdiction for these firms.  They have connected vehicles registered in the IFSC that are serviced by professional services based here.  Their transactions are recorded here and often their bonds are issued here, but generally the servicing banks will be located in the City of London.  That is a separate banking system to our own.  As the European Banking Authority noted in January of last year, EU law ceased to apply to the British banking system.  How has the Central Bank dealt with that?  Has Mr. Makhlouf spoken to his counterpart in the Bank of England regarding this and what measures are being taken to ensure that transactions recorded here, and bonds issued here but using the British banking system do not slip through the cracks?<\/p><p> My second question relates to shadow banking.  These Russian-connected firms operate within Ireland's shadow banking sector.  At the end of 2020, that sector was worth around &euro;3.5 trillion.  That is almost nine times our GDP.  Considering how inflated our GDP already is, it is an incomprehensible sum.  It has tripled in size over the last decade without much comment being passed on it.  The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was fairly categorical in its assessment of the contributory causes of the global financial crisis over a decade ago, and shadow banking played a key role in that regard.  The presence of section 110 organisations has played a key role in Ireland becoming one of the top five jurisdictions in the world for shadow banking assets.  I raised this recently with the Taoiseach, who said he had no issue with a cost-benefit analysis of the section 110 regime.  In light of the risks shadow banking poses to financial stability, the reputational damage we incur from things like Russian-connected firms and section 110 organisations being used by vulture funds, which is completely inappropriate, and considering that those availing of section 110 make almost no contribution to the Exchequer, would Mr. Makhlouf also accept the need for a cost-benefit analysis of section 110?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#H01000","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Makhlouf to be as brief as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#J00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Would the Chair like to take all the questions and I will try to answer them all together?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>If that is agreeable to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#J00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":496,"content":"<p>That could make it more difficult to get the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#J00500","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I am conscious Deputy Farrell asked very specific questions and it is important they get answered.

Perhaps the witnesses can respond in writing.  I do not want to delay the meeting.<\/p><p>In response to Deputy O'Callaghan, it was mentioned that credit unions are not anything like [<i>interruptions<\/i>] that they can give right now.  However, credit unions would say that under the current lending limits sent by the Central Bank, they can only hope to offer just 3% of the mortgage loans and less than 10% of the SME loans in the market.  There will be further commentary on the regulatory reserve ratio.  The credit unions would assert the 10% is out of step with the risk profile of credit unions.  In the briefing note we received from the credit union sector, it is apparent it wants to play a greater role in business loans, mortgages and so on.  Quite frankly, I believe the credit union movement is the answer to our community banking question.  The Central Bank should review the current position regarding credit unions.  I say that to the witnesses, because customers can walk into a credit union anywhere, meet a person and get an answer.  The person in the credit union will understand the customer because he or she is part of the parish the credit union represents.  I think the Central Bank is missing that point.<\/p><p>My next question concerns the tracker mortgage investigation.  A lot has been done in the investigation by the Central Bank, this committee and, indeed, others.  There are issues emerging in banks that are part of the tracker mortgage question.  Those who have the loans from the bank are being bullied and intimidated by the banks that granted them the loan.  If that loan has been sold on in the meantime to a vulture fund, the bullying and intimidation starts then.  The tracker mortgage status of these customers is not being recognised, even though they believe they should be part of the tracker mortgage issue.  Even though they have gone through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and so on, there is evidence the banks are ignoring all of this in the final run to the finish line.  They are trampling all over commercial loans, individual loans and mortgages, and they are using receivers to punch the daylights out of those who hold those loans.  I have seen some reports about the activities of receivers.  It would put a shiver up your spine to think they can get away with what they are getting away with.<\/p><p>Will the Central Bank not approach each of these banking entities and demand the accounts profile in terms of the loans that are outstanding so the bank can see for itself the issues that are being raised because of these loans by the banking entity?  For example, there are allegations of fraud.  In one particular case, there has been an adjustment of documents that should not have happened.  I sent details of one case to the Central Bank.  I followed the money from the bank to an individual associated with the bank, but not the borrower, and it ended up in the Central Bank.  If the issues we raise here are not investigated, it is going to give licence to the banks to do pretty much what they want and get away with it.  I am raising that as a general point.  I will send details of the specific cases to Mr. Makhlouf.  I honestly feel the Central Bank should take up with the banks the issues contained in the cases that are highlighted here.<\/p><p>On another subject, Deputy Doherty raised the issue of the banks that are closing and what is happening with all of the accounts.  Are the remaining banks able to cater for those accounts?  My personal experience, and the experiences that have been shared with me by others, is the banks concerned could not give a damn.  Customers are left to take all of their own actions where the bank is supposed to assist and help.  It is not happening.  It certainly did not happen in my own case.  There are many others, such as Deputy Doherty, who have come to me and complained about the fact they have had no assistance whatsoever, despite the fact this rule is in place in terms of giving assistance to the customers.<\/p><p>My next question concerns politically exposed persons.  Will the witnesses share with the committee what written guidelines the Central Bank has provided to the banks relating to politically exposed persons?  Will they provide a definition of what the Central Bank considers to be an associate of a politically exposed person?  Again, the experience of parliamentarians and others is we are being treated like criminals.<\/p><p>The way banks are behaving is shocking.  It is not just affecting individuals but it is also affecting staff members, associates and family members.  I do not think it was ever intended to do that.  I am all for regulation, transparency and accountability, but crucifixion does not come into it and that is what they are into.  I mention receivers and the switching code, which were referred to earlier.  Does the Central Bank have any role with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC?  Does it come under the Central Bank's banking resolutions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#K00900","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":531,"content":"<p>We have.

Following on from the committee&rsquo;s exchange of views with the Central Bank Governor, Mr. Makhlouf, and the deputy governor, Mr. Donnery, including in regard to the Central Bank&rsquo;s recently published multi-year strategy and regulatory priorities, we are pleased to have the opportunity to discuss with the committee a number of issues in the area of financial regulation, particularly in the context of the rapidly changing financial services landscape in Ireland and the EU.<\/p> <p>  At the Central Bank, as members know, we seek to safeguard financial stability and protect consumers through our ambition for a resilient and trustworthy financial system which sustainably serves the needs of the economy and citizens of Ireland and the EU.  In achieving this objective, we recognise the context of deep and rapid change and innovation in which we operate and we seek to deploy our regulatory powers so the benefits of this change are realised for the consumers and users of financial services and the risks mitigated.  Our strategy strongly reflects this context where the theme of safeguarding stability and the interests of citizens is positioned at the centre of an approach that is future-focused, transforming, open and engaged.<\/p> <p>  Among the important areas of change that we currently observe are, first, a rapid evolution in the way in which banking, payment and other financial services are provided to customers; second, technology-driven development of whole new product areas and activities, with the dramatic growth of crypto assets being the most notable to date; third, the ever-increasing role of data and data analytics in financial services provision; and, fourth, the pivot to a net zero carbon economy and the imperative for the financial sector to be at the heart of that transition.  There is also, of course, Brexit, Covid-19 and now the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and its still unfolding consequences, which teach us that not only does the financial system and its oversight have to deal with continuing change, it also has to be able to cope with periods of fundamental uncertainty.  The pandemic, in particular, has shown us the benefits of building resilience in the financial sector to continue to serve the needs of consumers and investors through periods of stress.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, as across Europe, some of the biggest changes in financial services have been seen in the area of retail banking and payments.  For example, in the area of payments and e-money firms, we have seen the number of authorised firms grow by an order of magnitude in four years, from low single digits to more than 40, with a significant further number currently in the approvals process.  Technological advances have also provided opportunities for existing banks and firms.  Many have adapted their business models, focusing on digitalisation strategies as customer behaviours turn more and more to online services.  Reducing their cost base to be more in line with EU norms and remain competitive in such an environment continues to be an important aspect of banks&rsquo; strategies.<\/p> <p>  Beyond banking and payments, we also see significant interest in authorisation among tech-driven investment firms and virtual asset service providers, so-called VASPs.  It is clear the range and nature of financial services and the manner in which they are provided to consumers and users is undergoing significant change.  Provided new entrants have suitably consumer-focused cultures, this is to be welcomed.  Innovation and new entrants that are well and proportionately regulated are key to a well-functioning financial system.  It is also consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a tech-oriented jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>  Through our innovation hub as well as through our informal and formal authorisation engagements, we seek to ensure that new and innovative firms can engage easily, straightforwardly and transparently with the Central Bank.  At the same time, of course, we expect prospective and existing regulated firms to be well run, with sufficient finance and good risk management, to be resolvable and to have a consumer-oriented culture so that consumers are neither misled nor mistreated.<\/p><p> The retail banking sector in Ireland is seeing considerable change right now with the withdrawal of Ulster Bank and KBC.  We are closely engaging with all relevant banks to ensure that the challenges this poses are being matched by plans, preparations and resources.  We expect all concerned to prioritise the interests of customers and prospective customers and we are prepared to intervene further if necessary, should this transition not proceed in line with our<\/p><p>expectations.<\/p><p> One aspect of the retail banking sector that is not changing as quickly as we would like to see is the level of distressed debt in the system.  About 47,000 principal dwelling households, PDHs, are still in mortgage arrears, of which approximately 32,500 have missed at least three payments and are 90 days or more past due.  This is a source of deep stress for the families and individuals concerned.  Successfully resolving distressed debt is important to the fair treatment of borrowers as well as to the effective support of the domestic economy.  As well as dealing with existing arrears, we have been clear with lenders on the need to be vigilant to identify and deal with new arrears cases.  We expect lenders to have in place a range of restructuring options capable of delivering sustainable solutions.  When a borrower is offered an alternative repayment arrangement, it must have realistic potential to resolve the borrower&rsquo;s arrears position on an appropriate and sustainable basis.  Lenders should also review and enhance their approach to dealing with personal insolvency practitioners.<\/p><p> As part of the financial services landscape, credit unions continue to fulfil a central role.  While that landscape is changing, we want to see a sustainable sector serving local communities across Ireland.  How the sector competes with others is a critical factor in their future sustainability.<\/p><p> The rapidly evolving use of data and data analytics is another factor changing the way financial services are provided.  Done well, this can bring material benefits to financial services users and the economy.  However, firms must be vigilant to ensure that the manner in which they use data serves customers' best interests.<\/p><p> Ensuring the fair treatment of customers was the guiding principle behind the publication earlier this month of our new insurance regulations.  Price walking in the motor and home insurance markets, that is, the practice by which premiums charged are increased the longer the customer is with the firm, will be banned from 1 July 2022.  This ban will benefit consumers by removing any loyalty penalty for consumers of long tenure.  In order to support switching and competition in the market, new customer discounts will continue to be allowed.<\/p><p> Finally, a word on climate risk and the transition to a net zero carbon economy.  This forms an important aspect of our multi-year strategy.  The financial sector, which will be key to successful transition, has three key responsibilities: to assess and manage their exposure to climate and transition risk; to achieve high quality, accurate and reliable standards of disclosure so that customers and investors can have full confidence about a product or service that is labelled<\/p><p>&ldquo;green&rdquo;; and to evolve their business models and offerings to align with and support the move during the current and immediately coming period to a carbon neutral economy.  At the Central Bank, we are engaging with firms across our supervisory mandate to ensure these responsibilities are being fulfilled.<\/p><p> I will stop here.  Hopefully, I have given members a good sense of the some of the challenges coming from this period of significant change and innovation and how we see these and are approaching them.  My colleagues and I look forward to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the meeting.  To a degree, the issue I want to raise was addressed somewhat by the Governor and his colleague, Ms Donnery, earlier on, but it is probably more appropriate to tease this question out a little further with the other witnesses, given that they have direct responsibility for the issue of consumer protection within the Central Bank of Ireland.  I want to focus my contribution, observations and questions on the issue of the exit of KBC and Ulster Bank from the Irish market.  We know that those exits are imminent and this has the potential to create real problems in terms of switching and moving bank accounts from one entity to another.<\/p> <p>  As the individuals responsible for consumer protection in the Central Bank of Ireland, are the witnesses satisfied that both the exiting and receiving banks have the capacity to deal with the additional workload caused by the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#N00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I will turn to Ms McMunn first and then to Mr. Kincaid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Nash&rsquo;s specific question, there is an acknowledgement for us that this is a seismic shift in terms of the retail banking sector.  I want to assure the committee that it is an absolute priority issue for us, in terms of our engagement with the institutions across our collective teams.  It has been a priority issue for us since the announcements by both of the banks last year.  We have cross-divisional teams that are dedicated to working on these issues with the specific banks.  There has been much engagement and it is multifaceted in relation to the issue.  I appreciate and will come to the Deputy&rsquo;s question in a moment, which is specifically on the liabilities.  However, there are asset and liability transfers happening.  It is a multifaceted issue.  There will be much work that needs to be done to ensure this is done safely.<\/p> <p>  At a very headline level, we expect the firms to do it well.  It needs to be led by the executives of these institutions and overseen and challenged by their boards.  They need to have a customer-focused lens in their approach, which includes in terms of the plans they put in place.  We have made many supervisory interventions since last year.  On the specific issue, it is not just around the liability side, but it is about ensuring the banks have the capacity to take on both assets and liabilities.<\/p> <p>  I will pass to Mr. Kincaid in a moment but from our perspective, a supervisor&rsquo;s job is not to just form a view of how the institution is right now, but of how it will cope with the challenges ahead.  That is our role, in terms of pointing that out.  I have spoken to each of the CEOs of the retail banks and impressed upon them the importance of the months ahead in relation to the phased migration of customers from both the asset and liability sides.  In addition, I impressed upon the leadership of the retail banking system that the system must ensure it has done all it can for customers in relation to this migration activity.<\/p> <p>  I will pass to Mr. Kincaid now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary-Elizabeth McMunn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>Since it is my first time to speak, I thank members for the opportunity to talk about these issues with them.  As Ms McMunn said, there are many aspects to this, both loans and bank accounts.  Looking specifically at the bank accounts for a moment, the customers who have bank accounts at Ulster Bank and KBC are customers of Ulster Bank and KBC.  Ulster Bank and KBC have duties to those customers and will continue to have them until those customers are onboarded to a new destination, which is a huge exercise to complete.  It requires a significant effort on the part of both the departing banks and remaining banks.  We have been very clear with the institutions and in the public domain that the institutions are not yet where they need to be on this specific aspect of their migration plans, which is the onboarding and migration of customers with current accounts and deposit accounts.  There is also work under way in those institutions.  It can be done, provided those resources and plans are put in place and are executed well.  We will be scrutinising that.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the banks to which consumers choose to move their accounts, our consumer protection code is very clear in applying not just to consumers, but also to prospective consumers.  Institutions have a duty to consumers who come in through whatever channel to them to open an account.  For example, one of the reasons we put so much emphasis on the issue of call waiting times recently was exactly because, as Ms McMunn said, we saw a pinch point emerging in this and we intervened to require additional resourcing.<\/p><p>In answer to the Deputy's net question, it is a significant challenge but, provided the resources are put in place and it is done properly and done well, it can be done.  We will be focusing on it to make sure that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kincaid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I have a couple of follow-up questions around the practicalities of how all of this is going to work.  I had a message earlier from a constituent.  Under normal circumstances, I do not believe he would be moving from Ulster Bank or KBC necessarily.  It is just that, in the normal way, he has decided to take the advice that is often proffered to switch his bank accounts.  It has taken four months to do that in normal times, and we are no longer in normal times.  This has the potential to be catastrophic for individuals and for small businesses.  I hope the Central Bank is aware of that and is prepared to take whatever action it can to try to ensure this unprecedented transfer of accounts is as seamless as possible.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kincaid made the point that the banks are not where they need to be at this stage.  The Central Bank Governor put it more bluntly earlier when he said the banks are simply not ready.  We are expecting that over the next few days Ulster Bank will issue letters to several hundred thousand customers to alert them to what is expected of them and what is required over the next few months as it exits the market.  We are in a difficult situation.  The Governor said they are not ready.  Mr. Kincaid said they are not where they ought to be.  Is the six-month deadline that has been imposed by Ulster Bank for customers to close or switch their accounts appropriate or realistic, or should it change?  If Mr. Kincaid and the Governor do not believe that the banks are ready, and given the fact we could potentially face a very serious interruption in our economy and in the personal lives of ordinary bank customers across the country, does Mr. Kincaid think that Ulster Bank should not send out those letters and that it should postpone that and extend the six-month period for switching and closing accounts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#O00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>We are starting into this process now.  As the Deputy said, it will be done through a period of phasing, so the migration of accounts will be phased over time and we will be observing that very closely and scrutinising it.  The reason I started my earlier remarks by referring to the responsibilities the departing banks and the remaining banks have to their customers is to deal precisely with that concern the Deputy is talking about.  It is important that we get started.  The phasing approach is to be welcomed.  As the requirements that we have placed on the institutions come online, and as we see the behaviour of consumers and the choices that consumers make as they get these letters, and they are being given several months to act on them, we will see the progress that is made.  It is important that we get started and that we work our way through this.<\/p> <p>  As I said, we are very clear in our engagements that the departing banks have obligations to the customers that are with them and will continue to have those obligations until those customers are properly migrated to new locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kincaid"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I have a couple of final questions, with the indulgence of the Chair.  Some Ulster Bank customers have already made the decision to switch their bank accounts.  Has the Central Bank been monitoring that on a monthly basis?  Would the witnesses happen to have the figures with them today that would indicate how many Ulster Bank customers have migrated already?  That is the first question of my final round.  I am assuming the Central Bank has a process in place to do that.<\/p> <p>  I have two related supplementary questions.  There is an obligation on the banks to comply with the switching code, and this has been mentioned by other colleagues.  In response to a letter I wrote to the Central Bank on 7 March, Mr. Kincaid responded on 28 March and I am grateful for his response.  He said that the Central Bank is prepared to intervene further if it is not satisfied with progress.  What does &ldquo;intervene further&rdquo; mean in practice?  What tools has the Central Bank available to it?  How long will it wait?  Is the Central Bank going to wait until the fifth or sixth month of this before an intervention is made if it is not satisfied with progress?  What kind of interventions is it prepared to make?  What weapons does it have in its armoury to force the banks to comply with the code and to do what is necessary and do the right thing by customers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#O00400","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>We have extensive powers to intervene on a matter like this.  We are not waiting, which is the point Ms McMunn was making in her earlier remarks.  We have been heavily engaged with the institutions since their announcements on a range of the aspects of this transaction, including the transfer of mortgages and other aspects, which we can speak to more fully if the Deputy wishes.  On this particular issue, neither are we waiting.  We have already been engaged with the institutions to require them to get their plans and their processes in place.  We have seen areas where we need those plans to be enhanced and improved, and that is a live discussion with them.  People have seen one element of that in what we came out with in terms of the findings in regard to call waiting times.  In terms of getting in at the sort of information the Deputy is talking about, such as exactly where customers are migrating from and to, while aggregate switching numbers are available, that is something that we really want to ramp up on and have been ramping up on with the individual institutions precisely to understand that migration behaviour and where those pinch points are coming.  Consumers will make their own choices as well, of course, as to which institution they want to go to, so it is not simply that every institution will face a certain fraction, and some may face more than others.<\/p> <p>  There is no question of us waiting.  This is a live engagement that we have with the institutions.  However, it is also important to say that we need to see the process get up and running and get started, and to start to see and be agile in our reaction.

My first question relates to the credit unions.  It has always frustrated me that there are two significant financial dots that have never been joined in this country and that concerns the money the credit unions have that they want to put into funds to be invested in the housing market.  It is estimated that about &euro;12 billion or &euro;13 billion of funds are with the credit unions at the moment, and they seek to make that funding available to approved housing bodies so those approved housing bodies have the ability to build houses.  God knows, we have a real need of houses in this country at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I met with the regulator of the credit unions a number of years ago and I got a very strong sense that the regulator felt that the capacity to manage that was not in the credit unions.  My instinct was that if the capacity was not there, then the Government should help to buttress or build that capacity to facilitate this.  I know that a number of funds have been created in recent months, small funds which can be used with the approved housing bodies.<\/p><p>I do not see the Government, or at least the State, providing the requisite energy concerning these funds.  Equally, if the law was changed, the amount of money that could be made available to the AHBs would increase greatly.  The credit unions have different rules and regulations around regulatory reserves, lending limits, etc.  There is a great need in the State for housing but a great absence of the required funding.  In that context, and given the funds the credit union sector has and its wish to use those funds to finance housing, would it not be logical for us to change the law and build capacity to allow those funds to be increased?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#O01200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I am happy to take that question.  To start with the part of the Deputy's question concerning the restrictions on lending limits, it is important from our perspective to say that we introduced tiered lending limits in house and business lending in 2020.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of it.  Another aspect concerns the lending we see taking place versus the capacity of the system to undertake lending.  In house lending, the value of house loans outstanding is now &euro;260 million.  That is 10% of the capacity for house lending, which means that 90% of the lending capacity remains.  Regarding outstanding business loans, those amounted to &euro;128 million, or 5% of allowable capacity in that context, which means that 95% of the lending capacity remains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary-Elizabeth McMunn"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Why is that the case?

A couple of factors are at play here.  Our registrar recently gave a speech on this topic before representatives of the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, and we would be happy to send a copy to the committee members if they have not already seen it.  First and foremost, we must recognise that market share cannot be built overnight in house lending.  Established lenders are in the market already and have scale, which means they have a natural competitive advantage.  Additionally, those lenders have the competence and capability to undertake such lending, and these aspects must also be built up to allow this type of lending to be done.  This is equally the case on the business side.  Often, additional lending capability may be needed in niche areas and it also takes time to build capacity in this regard.

I understand this is likely to be a policy area for the Government rather than a responsibility of the Central Bank of Ireland, but as a country in the grip of such a vicious housing crisis, it is a mistake to be missing this opportunity to match these funds to the organisations that wish to build housing.<\/p> <p>  Turning to another element of this context, the banking market here is phenomenally concentrated.  Indeed, it is further concentrating almost yearly.  Our banking structure is an oligopoly.  This gives enormous power to the existing banks in respect to all the aspects of their engagements with customers.  I refer to interest rates, where they do business and all the attendant terms and conditions.  This is bad for consumers and for citizens.  There is a crisis in this regard and it has several aspects.  The first concerns why this concentration is happening.  The capital reserves held under the macroprudential rules, etc., have an effect on the profitability levels banks can achieve in this State.  <\/p> <p>  The Governor said earlier that some companies are leaving the market but that new ones are entering it.  I have no sense, however, that the institutions coming into the market have the capacity that would allow us to say they are truly replacing those entities leaving.  There is no evidence to show that the companies entering the market, in slightly different financial forms, have the capacity to take on the business that Ulster Bank and KBC are leaving.  We must ensure that we increase competition in this market to make it a healthier one.  There are several ways to do that.  One involves the credit union sector and the second is a public banking system.  At least one political party in government, however, seems to have a fear of public banking, but it has proved to be a successful sector in many other strong economies, including Germany's, for example.  Would a public banking system make for a healthy component of a more competitive banking system overall?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#P00700","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I will lead off on this topic.

Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will have heard Governor Makhlouf say earlier that the reduction in the number of retail banks from five to three was a matter of concern from a competition perspective.  That is the case.  In my opening comments, however, I tried to briefly set out how much we are currently in a state of flux in respect of the evolution of our financial system.  It is important to say those are not just words; this is truly what we see happening.  During the last five years, we have seen significant evolution in the financial system.  As I mentioned in my opening comments, we have moved from there having been four authorised payments firms four years ago, to there now being more than 40, with 30 more in the approval pipeline.  Real change is happening in the sector.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth saying, because it is striking, that approximately 10% of new mortgage lending is offered by non-bank lenders.  Regarding the point made by the Deputy, that does not take up all the capacity that was serviced by Ulster Bank and KBC by any means, but it is a material amount of participation by these non-traditional lenders.  On the SME lending side, the equivalent figure is about 20%.  These are not exact numbers, but they are broadly correct.  This is without mentioning all we are seeing in respect of the technological change in this area.  The Deputy was correct in saying we cannot talk about some of these innovative newcomers as being the same as the retail banks in respect of their embeddedness.  That is true.  It is important to recognise as well, however, how rapidly the whole ecosystem is changing.  Ultimately, this is about the provision of services to customers, users and the economy.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, Governor Makhlouf mentioned we do not have a competition promotion role and that it was for others to undertake that aspect.<\/p><p>It is important for us, as we do our regulatory activities and engage with firms, to understand how what we are doing relates to and impacts on competition.  This includes how we engage with innovative firms and technology companies and how we are available to that cohort, so that we fully understand the changes that are taking place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>The volume of those exiting the market is not being matched by the entries and those left behind, which is key for consumers.  In many cases, they are not like for like services.  This is not a criticism of the witnesses.  That logic is nearly a white flag being raised with regard to the future of the banking market.  At the end of this, there will be hundreds of towns and villages with no bank or banking services and hundreds of thousands of people, including farmers, small businesspeople and families, having many of the banking services that were available to them disappear.  That has a significant effect on the functioning of the economy and society.<\/p> <p>  Is there any light at the end of the tunnel with the macroprudential rules?

I will address two or three, then Ms McMunn will speak.  This is not a one-for-one matter, where a bank leaves and is automatically replaced.  Are we seeing forces of competition in play?  Is the context in which this is taking place one where innovation and change are happening?  That is important, not to take away from the Deputy's point.  How are traditional banking services made available to all who need and want them across the country?  The Department of Finance's view on banking considers such matters, including the availability of cash, which contributes to the banking review.<\/p> <p>  It is important to address why the capital requirements are the way they are.  We recently published a paper on so-called risk-weighted assets, about the calculation of capital for mortgage lending.  We set out clearly what is driving those risk weights.  There are two components.  One is the probability of something going wrong in a loan.  The other is what happens if a loan goes wrong and what the losses will be.  One can see from the paper that we are very consistent and completely in line with the European requirements in this regard.  The fact that we had the crisis is relevant in Ireland, but it is becoming less impactful as we move further from it and our processes are improved.<\/p> <p>  On public banks, we will authorise, assess and supervise anything that comes our way that is within the remit of financial regulation.  We do not have a negative view on that.  It has simply not come to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>There were a couple of points linked to credit unions before I touch on interest rates.  I will be brief.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department is leading work on credit unions from a policy framework perspective.  We are providing feedback to that process.  That is the first point on policy.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy referred to the <i>Sparkassen<\/i>model for public banking.  We note that the 2018 and 2019 report both concluded that there was not a case for the establishment of a public banking in Ireland.  As Mr. Cross said, our disposition regarding new entrants is linked to our disposition regarding authorisation.  We are very open to new entrants coming here.<br\/><br\/>One final point on credit unions, which is linked to the like-for-like services, is that we permitted credit unions to provide additional services, including member, personal and current account services, MPCAS.  That allows credit unions to offer current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and other payment services.  Some 68 credit unions currently provide that.  Those additional services have been permitted under legislation since 2016.  That relates to balancing assets and liability.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked when we will see benefits of better lending as a result of the macroprudential measures feeding into reduced capital requirements, if I understand him correctly.  That is a complex question.  It will take time, as Mr. Cross said.  We have had higher defaults here than in other EU countries.  We have a higher stock of non-performing loans on the books of the banks than in other EU countries.  It takes longer to work out collateral here than in other EU countries.  Comparison between countries is often tricky, because other things happen to risk-weighted assets in European jurisdictions that elevate the capital requirements in those jurisdictions.  Our recently published paper provides a good handle on where there are additions to risk weights in other jurisdictions, so they can be compared with us.<br\/><br\/>Capital is just one element of interest rates.  There are five aspects, including operational expenses, cost of funding, cost of risk, capital, which we have mentioned, and the competitive environment for banks.  We have higher levels for the first four in Ireland.  I will address operational expenses.  The cost-to-income ratios for banks in Ireland are approximately 20% to 30% higher than for European peers.  Irish banks generate their income much more from net interest income rather than the more diversified income of other European banks, which might include fees and commissions or more diverse business models.  One can see through the transactional activity here that some banks are trying to improve the diversification of income, which would improve their cost-income ratios.<br\/><br\/>Regarding expenses, banks seek to be cost efficient.  That may mean changing the number of branches or staff that they have.  It also includes being more efficient through digitalisation.  Banks are seeking to gain traction on both income and expenses to address interest rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary-Elizabeth McMunn"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.  My final question relates to the economy as a whole.  Inflation radically affects families across the country.

The Government warned that salary increases could have a spiralling effect on inflation.<\/p><p>This committee often talks about wage increases for people who are very wealthy and there does not seem to be a problem about it at all.  When it comes to wage increases for people on low and middle incomes there is a warning given that it could lead to spiralling prices in the future.  There are highly profitable businesses, and I am thinking of the ESB itself which made a profit of &euro;650 million this year.  It is incredible that one of its arms is increasing the cost of electricity at the same time.  There are many businesses in this country that are extremely profitable and it would be possible for them to offer pay rises to workers and still not put an upward spiralling pressure on wage inflation if that were the case.

The two areas of risk that are interlinked, which I am hoping the witnesses can shed more light on, are cryptocurrencies and crypto assets, and climate.  I want to get a sense of what the strategies are, what assessments are being made and what actions are being taken in these areas.  The Central Bank has produced a useful briefing on crypto assets and acknowledged that there is a financial risk involved with them.  We know there is a lot of debate on whether or not crypto assets should be allowed to be included within investment portfolios and that there is a financial risk component to that.  I am of the opinion that we should not be allowing that but I would like the witnesses' views on that.<\/p> <p>  On a wider level, in the briefing the Central Bank mentioned and acknowledged the fact that there is a huge sustainability risk in how energy intensive cryptocurrency and crypto assets are.  They are creating extreme pressure in energy usage in some cases.  The Central Bank used the example of the Cambridge Bitcoin electricity consumption index, which highlighted that Bitcoin uses more energy in a year than entire countries like Norway.  Kazakhstan is another pertinent example, which last year was the second largest cryptocurrency mining country in the world with some mines running 50,000 computers.  That has led to and contributed to an energy crisis and political instability in Kazakhstan.<\/p> <p>  I am on the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action as well as this committee so this is an area of real concern to us.  In the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action we are hearing potential predictions, which are worrying, that data centres in Ireland could be using up to 33% of our national electricity by 2030.  A frank discussion we have had is that this is an energy crunch.  I slightly disagree with Mr. Makhlouf as he seemed to suggest that it is a temporary supply bottleneck but we know the energy transition is substantial.  It is not simply a matter that the oil and gas will start flowing again.  We are in an energy crunch, in terms of having sufficient renewable energy for the next five to ten years and of how we manage our energy.  We need to look at demand reduction.  In that context, is mining cryptocurrency or processing crypto assets a responsible use of electricity and energy over the next period of time?  What is the Central Bank looking at in that area?  I know the digital financial package and distributed ledger technology are being looked at as a pilot but besides that pilot at the EU level, what are the national regulation options or moratoriums we could be looking at for crypto assets and cryptocurrency?  Has a risk assessment been conducted or will a risk assessment be conducted by the Central Bank as part of its multi-year strategy on the implications of crypto assets for our climate targets and the net zero carbon economy goal it outlined in its presentation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#R00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>These are hugely important and very difficult questions.  I will start by talking about our approach to crypto in the round and then I will focus on energy.  We published a warning last week, building on the work of the European supervisory authorities, on the real risks in crypto investment by retail.  Mr. Makhlouf spoke to this because in many cases cryptocurrencies are unbacked and broadly speculative and that is matched with a remarkable level of promotional activity by influencers and celebrities, etc.  It is truly a new phenomenon and there are real concerns about how that dynamic is playing out.  On the other hand, when one looks at the underlying technology and functioning of something like Bitcoin, it is quite remarkable.  There are potential advances and things might evolve in the next three, five or ten years to the good of the economy, the consumer and the user in smart contracts, for example.  There is a significant potential benefit there.  Our job is to try to manage the risks and at the same time try to allow the potential to develop.  The Senator will have heard Mr. Makhlouf say that there are different type of crypto assets and different ways in which they operate.  While they can be problematic, they are also opening up the financial services sector and market to a range of young consumers who previously would not have had that engagement or access.  That raises questions around financial literacy and education and there is also a potential material positive in that space.  Funds focused on the retail investors should not have crypto assets in them but we are more open to funds targeted at professional investors.<\/p> <p>  The Senator&rsquo;s point on energy use is fundamentally important.  It is really good to see that debate so live in the European Parliament in the context of the markets in crypto assets legislation which is currently under way and I am sure that debate will remain live as it goes through the trilogue discussion between the European Parliament and the European Council.  Wherever that comes out, the deal that will likely be done there means this will be firmly on the agenda.  Until now it has been right to say that the energy consumption issue has not been properly on the agenda and it needs to be.  I could not agree with the Senator more on that.  I talked about the underlying technology and it is interesting that already we see these products move from proof of work, which is highly energy intensive, to proof of stake, which is another type of verification mechanism.  We are already seeing the evolution of these products to respond to those challenges.  I am not sure I am giving the Senator the clarity she might like but we see the risks in this space.  We are also conscious of the potential benefits.<\/p><p>We are also very conscious that Ireland is seen as a jurisdiction where those interested in providing services for crypto assets will be interested in locating themselves.  We are seeing that come through, for example, with some of the registration processes around virtual assets service providers.  There is a lot going on in this space and it is right to say that we need to focus on the risks while at the same time trying to put in place the things that will allow the benefits to be realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Okay.  I am a little bit concerned to be honest because, as Mr. Cross said, this is fundamentally speculative.  This is not necessarily real economy work.  I am extremely concerned that some such businesses, services and financial services may be considering relocating in Ireland.  I do not want us to become a poor regulator and a poor actor in this area.  Ireland has a disproportionate number of data processing centres compared to other European countries.  It would be a worry if we are also seen in any way as being a place where we end up championing or allowing what is fundamentally an unsustainable activity.  Apart from any cost benefit, I have not heard a robust or serious risk analysis.<\/p> <p>  On the emissions piece, we talked about net zero and the obligation to ensure that we have accuracy around what products or services are labelled as green.  With the European taxonomy, for example, the witnesses will be aware that there is a lot of concern and debate at the moment about the attempt to include gas in the taxonomy, and that there is a danger that many international investors will not engage when things are not green.  Would Mr. Cross not agree that currently cryptocurrencies and crypto assets cannot be labelled as sustainable or green?  We are talking about a new area of financial service expansion that is fundamentally unsustainable and not in line with this taxonomy or with prioritising green investment.  I am concerned about that.  When Mr. Cross answers that, I will ask my two final questions.  They are on unrelated issues but are important.<\/p> <p>  With regard to distressed debt and so on, there is an issue that has been touched on but I would like to touch on it further, which is the concern where the banks are exiting the Irish market to such a degree and people's mortgages and other loans are sold on.  This is a concern especially around distressed assets being sold on.  We know that mortgage holders often seek an opportunity to settle their existing debt with a financial institution rather than having that debt passed on.  There are those who are solvent and want to sort the debt with the financial institution before it is sold on to another actor, and there are those who wish to settle their debt with an institution that has purchased a mortgage book.<\/p> <p>  In that regard, what work is happening at a time when a lot of debt is, effectively, changing hands, be that distressed debt or non-distressed debt, to ensure that ultimately the mortgage holders have that opportunity for negotiating around their own exit so they do not see their mortgage being sold for less than they would be willing to pay themselves?<\/p> <p>  On credit unions, there is a programme for Government commitment on community banking.  With absolute respect, the 2018 and 2019 reviews predate the programme for Government, and the commitment to community banking in that, and they also predate the exit of many of the commercial and retail banks that we have seen over the past year and a half.  It is certainly time for a review.  The opening statement referred to the credit unions being able to compete with others, but the fact is that the credit unions are not being allowed to compete in these areas because they are being constrained in accessing the market and fulfilling that public banking role.  Perhaps Mr. Cross will comment on those three issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#S00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I will say something very briefly on the crypto piece and I will pass over to Mr. Kincaid and then to Ms McMunn on the credit unions.<\/p> <p>  I very much share the risk concerns about the crypto markets the Senator has identified.

There is such a range.  The issue around the energy consumption is now a very heightened concern and one sees that evolution to a proof of stake and other ways of getting around some of those energy problems.

As the Governor and Mr. Cross said, it is a priority area for us and has been for some time.  This is because we recognise that for any person to find themselves in a position of arrears on a loan that is secured on the roof over their head is an incredibly distressful situation.  Going right back to the financial crisis, we have been very proactive in putting in place a framework dedicated to dealing with those situations and requiring the institutions that we supervise to have arrears support units in place to deal with those, and to do so professionally.<\/p> <p>  We have also been very diligent in making sure that this framework applies not just to banks but also to non-bank lenders and to entities that service those loans.  We have done that in our own frameworks and we have advocated at a legislative level for that.  The very important message for consumers to have is that if a person or an SME has a mortgage, a loan, or an unsecured consumer loan that is covered by the rules of the Central Bank of Ireland, it will remain covered by the rules of the Central Bank of Ireland, regardless of who the loan is sold to.  That loan can only be sold to somebody who is subject to the supervision of the Central Bank of Ireland.  That is a very important point for people to understand.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Cross said in his opening remarks, one of the areas we really want to see progress on this year is in long-term mortgage arrears.  We still have a significant proportion of long-term mortgage arrears.  These are cases where loans are in arrears of more than one year, where it is argued that considerable progress can be made by the lenders.  We have taken those loan books, broken them down and compartmentalised them into groupings of customers.  We say to the institutions that these customers seem to us to be in a position where they should be able to reach an agreement with those consumers, and particularly given the narrative that we hear from lenders of how difficult it can be to repossess or enforce property in Ireland.  Our narrative back to that is that if that is the case, and given how we have broken down these books, there is considerable scope for improvement.<\/p> <p>  Members will see in the figures we published this morning that there continues to be reduction in mortgage arrears.  We would also say that we have always been struck by the extent to which that reduction tends to come about because of specific interventions by the teams in my area and in Ms McMunn's area in dealing with those lenders.  That will remain an area of focus for us, but with regard to the banks that are departing and the transfer of loans, the key message is that it does not change the protections that are there for borrowers.  The purview of the Central Bank and the work we will be doing will be on those loan books regardless of where they move to.  The Central Bank would be very engaged across that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kincaid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":586,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely right in respect of the timing of the previous reports to which I referred on the public banking model.

As the Deputy intimated, it is a really big question because there are all sorts of implications to be considered.  The Deputy referred to one such precise implication, which is whether it would involve moving to a situation where consumers and anyone else using money have their account directly with the ECB.   That could be the case.  It could also be the case that there may be a level of potential intrusiveness by the State and the authorities in respect of information.  There is a whole issue in respect data and privacy that is really important and difficult to get to grips with.  There is a question in respect of what it means for the banking system and the payment system and how should we think about that.  One way to think about it is as a natural evolution.  Banks were developed to solve a particular issue at a particular time.  Things have now moved on and the way we can do money has moved on and banks, therefore, may need to evolve to reflect that.<\/p> <p>  All of these questions are at the heart of the debate that is going on right now in the ECB and the European system of central banks.  We are totally involved in that discussion.  We take part in the various standing committees, working groups and projects that are under way precisely to work out how it should work and what the choices are.  Of course, there is the whole issue of how it works technologically.  We need to consider what the choices are in respect of these types of issues.  For example, if banks will no longer play their previous role in the context of payments because that can be done directly through the ECB, will that bring banks back more towards their credit intermediation role?  To be clear, I do not have answers to these questions.  They are precisely the questions that are being considered now.

Is it bigger than just one company or is there nothing to be concerned about in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#T00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":590,"content":"<p>If the Deputy will forgive me, I will not hazard an answer to that question.

As regards differential or dual pricing, I welcome the work that was done by the Central Bank and, in fairness, the engagement we have had in the past two yeas since I submitted a complaint.  I also welcome the fact that the analysis is now being carried out, although I do have concerns in respect of how it is being implemented.  I made a submission in that regard to the consultation that closed earlier in the year.  I note that our guests made the point that the Central Bank wants to encourage discounts for switching purposes.  In the context of car insurance and home insurance, 70% or 80% of customers stay with their provider.   Unfortunately, they continue to renew instead of moving to another company.  There are deposits, however.  In the North and in Britain that is not allowed.  I am sure our guests have read my submission.  As all present are aware, the danger is that the premium gets loaded in the first year of renewal, so it is just basically truncated into 24 months.  The company lures the customer in and then loads up the premium in the first year because it cannot do so thereafter.  The problem is that people do not leave, as is also the case in the context of banking and financial products.  I refer to what happened with Ulster Bank.  It is now leaving the country.  People could not access their money for several weeks but they did not leave and go to another bank.  That is a problem.  I have concerns in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I know the Central Bank is putting forward an argument that Ireland is different.  To me, it is clear that in terms of motor insurance Ireland is a sub-market to Britain, in reality.  The major insurance companies here are the same ones that are operating in Britain.  I know the market is smaller here - it is smaller than the market in Manchester, for example - but I still believe we could have operated the same type of proposal that pertains there.  Discounts still happen there.  I am looking at a website offering insurance in the North.  A driver living in Newry can get a 20% discount on a new policy if he or she goes online to get it or knows somebody with the same policy.  Discounts are allowed for new customers but renewing customers, even if they are in their fourth year or fifth year, also have to get the same discount for that period.  Insurance companies would still be allowed to offer that kind of market attraction but all customers who renew that month would also have to be able to avail of it.  I put that on the record because I am concerned about this issue and it needs to be monitored very carefully.<\/p> <p>  Insurance companies are already changing the way they calculate insurance premiums.  For example, Liberty Insurance has changed the way it calculates quotes.  It now gives customers a quote that may be less than the premium for the previous year but it excludes windscreen cover, which has to be selected as an add-on, whereas previously it was included automatically.  The companies have pared it down to the basics and everything else is an add-on.  That can confuse people as to whether they are getting better value.  We have to keep one step ahead in the context of the insurance industry.<\/p> <p>  I am bringing forward legislation and will be asking the Central Bank for its opinion on that Bill in a formal session.  I want to take this opportunity, however, to make the point that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, has referred to a 40% reduction in claims.  We know that a similar reduction has happened in the courts yet no reduction of that level is being passed on in any way to consumers.  We were told that we had to let this wash through and would have to wait for a while.  It is not happening.  My concern relates to the fact that there has been a reduction in motor insurance.  There is no doubt about that.  We can see the statistics.  This is what my legislation will address.  Not everybody is getting reductions.  I saw an insurance quote the other day that had doubled from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000.  On average, however, the cost of insurance has reduced.  There are several factors influencing that.<\/p><p>One thing we do not know, and the Central Bank cannot tell us, is whether the reduction in awards is being passed on in full to consumers.  In Britain, all the major insurance companies that operate will have to provide a report to outline what premiums they would be charging if the reductions in whiplash awards had not come into effect, and the premiums they have been charging over the past three years, and that will have to be audited before they give it to the UK Financial Conduct Authority, FCA.  Why can we not capture those types of data in the national claims information database in order that we can genuinely say the reason premiums have fallen relates to less traffic, better safety standards or whatever other measures have been taken into account, or whether it relates to the awards.  Our guests might comment on that.<\/p><p> On the issue of switching between the banks, I welcome Mr. Kincaid's comments, which were an important intervention, suggesting the banks are not ready or up to the job at this point.  We have concerns.  Switching banks, for some people, will be very easy.  They will be able to do so on their mobile phone if they do not have an overdraft.  God help those people who have overdrafts because they cannot do that.  They cannot even use the code but will have to agree it beforehand, or they will have to clear the overdraft, which many people will not have the resources to do.  Many people will be caught out here.  I am concerned the Central Bank, in its consumer protection role, is not stepping up to the level it should.  The Governor should have met the CEOs of the banks.  I can only assume from his response that has not happened.  Two banks are withdrawing from the country and the Governor, I understand, has not met the CEOs.  Three banks are going to receive about 1 million additional accounts over the coming years and that meeting has not happened.  There is a problem there, in my view.  That is no disrespect to our guests who have met the CEOs, or to Ms McMunn in particular, but this has to be dealt with at the highest level.<\/p><p> My understanding differs from something Mr. McKincaid said.  He stated the obligations to their customers will remain on the withdrawing until they have been onboarded to new destinations or, as he went on to say, until they have been properly migrated to new accounts.  My understanding is that is not what is going to happen.  The banks will have that obligation for six months and, thereafter, they will be able to close the account and send a cheque in the post, and every direct debit will fail after that point.  That is my understanding of the obligation KBC and Ulster Bank will have.  If I am wrong, Mr. Kincaid might correct me.  This is the problem.  The Central Bank has done good work on the issue of phone waiting times, but there are people who, we are told, cannot get an appointment to talk about the overdraft they will need for five or six weeks.  There will then be requirements relating to documentation, identification, the need for the bank to know its customer and everything else that takes place.  Furthermore, we understand some of the banks are giving people two options, namely, to close their account and set up a new one or to use the code.  People should be told not to close their account.  We need a public awareness campaign to tell them not to close their account until everything is in order.  I am concerned that people will be caught out and direct debits will fail.<\/p><p> Finally, in respect of the Irish Credit Bureau, no work has been done on the credit scores that apply when direct debits or mortgage payments fail as a result of customers not having the ability to meet them and the process that is not allowed.  Ms McMunn stated the six-month period can be extended but, while I am glad if that is the case, I understand this is a statutory notice sent to customers to say the clock has started ticking and that six months later, the account will be closed.  I was under the impression this is an official, legal obligation on the banks&rsquo; part.  Does the Central Bank have the ability to instruct the banks to extend the period beyond that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#T00600","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Durkan has a short question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#U00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648594800,"counter":594,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the sound quality of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s remote connection is very poor and we could not hear the question, but we have to move on.<\/p> <p>  I have a question relating to the Educational Building Society, EBS, tied agent issue, which was the subject of a court case.  Has the Central Bank examined the outcome?  It is a closed deal, with just one individual.  What role will the Central Bank play in facilitating those parties that have not been to court but are pursuing the EBS and AIB in respect of their case?  Can it expedite some form of mediation to bring the matter to a conclusion?  If I were to report an alleged fraud to the Central Bank, what action would it take?  Would it investigate that allegation or refer it to the Garda?<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that credit unions are not being allowed to perform as they could because of the regulation being imposed on them.  They are not being given a fair chance.  They offer a service that is exceptional and beyond what can be got in a bank.  The Central Bank has to give some leeway in respect of the regulation and how it pursues that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kincaid indicated he had information on various cohorts in the banks regarding how many mortgages are bad and cannot be reconciled and how many could be sorted out.  Will he provide us with detailed figures on that matter?<\/p> <p>  The issue of customer protection brings me back to my question regarding alleged fraud.  Where a customer brings to the Central Bank's attention something significant that has happened in a bank, before the Central Bank tells the customer it is a once-off case and it cannot investigate the matter, does it take the substance of the allegation and determine whether it is possibly widespread or happening in other banks?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I asked the Governor whether he would consider examining the tracker mortgage issue and the cases that have yet to be worked out, and whether he would take the profile of those cases and investigate whether they have not been worked out because the customer was wrong or, perhaps, because the banks were just dragging their heels on sorting them out because that may create a precedent and a significant number of other cases may be impacted in the context of the tracker issue.<\/p> <p>  I want to get comprehensive responses to all these questions and I will make a submission to the Governor in respect of them.  I bring them all to our guests' attention also because they are significant and the banks think they have got away with the tracker issue, given the balances of accounts left in the banks and still unresolved.

In regard to the cases that are before the Ombudsman, we made very specific provision to make sure that people could get the compensation through the Central Bank scheme and still have the capacity to go to the Ombudsman if they wished to take a case because they believed that in their personal circumstances they had an additional claim to make or they were in any way dissatisfied with the outcome that was yielded from that.

That is why they are still in dispute.  That is why I bring it up here.  The tracker mortgage scandal, in my opinion, is not concluded.  I said earlier to the Governor that what is happening here is that some of these loans are being sold to pass on the distressed mortgage, even though it is still a tracker issue.  Some of them are being forced into court if there is a receiver involved.  The cases I have inform me to the extent that I believe the Central Bank has an obligation to go through the remains of that investigation and ensure the banks are not hiding any more tracker mortgage issues.  If the Central Bank does that, it will then be informed of those that are outstanding and those that are being put into question by the bank in an unreasonable way.<\/p> <p>  I looked at some of the paperwork and I have to say that the alleged fraud jumps out at me in terms of a number of these cases.

We reach a conclusion on an exercise, but the Chair is right to say there are still cases going through those processes he outlined.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Ombudsman, which is where the original question came from, we are very engaged with the Ombudsman on all of those cases.  It is one of the areas where we get sight of all of the cases that he identifies.  It is absolutely our practice to consider them and to see if there is further action to take.  One of the things I wanted to get across was that where we see a need or where something is brought to our attention and there is a need for further action, whether it relates to the tracker or any other review we have done, we will, of course, take that action.  I was trying to sort of parcel it out between the review we did, the cases with the Ombudsman, and any further items that are brought to our attention.  We have a strong track record in practice of dealing with Ombudsman cases, High Court cases or issues that are brought to our attention and not just dealing with an individual case, as the Chair said, but of looking beyond that to see if there is a more systemic issue in that firm or beyond that.  We will continue to do that whether it is in the area of tracker or business interruption or any of the other areas where we have done that.<\/p> <p>  On the tied agents issue, I do not have much to add beyond what we said in this forum before.

The notification period in our code, which is about two months or so, is a notification to customers on a proposal to close an account.  As Ms McMunn said, the scale of this is such that everything is on the table in terms of the Central Bank reaching a conclusion that we need to intervene in a particular way.  I would not feel constrained in any way in regard to that.  However, I would reiterate the message that it is important that we get started in the process and start to make as much movement through that portfolio of accounts as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022033000002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kincaid"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I am sorry but we have to conclude the meeting because of the arrangements in the House.

I commend the committee on providing our umbrella organisation, which represents more than 30 patient organisations, with the opportunity to highlight the impact of Covid-19 on access to services for people with neurological conditions and the effects of the pandemic on an already-under-resourced area within our health services.  I will begin by paying tribute to all those who provided services and supports to people with neurological conditions and their families throughout the pandemic and continue to work to mitigate the impact on the care and treatment of people with neurological conditions.  In particular, I want to acknowledge the often-taken-for-granted work of the voluntary sector in its response to the pandemic, as highlighted in the 2021 National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report from the dialogue forum with voluntary organisations and in the words of the HSE's chief executive officer, Mr. Paul Reid.  Mr. Reid referred to the importance of building a new relationship with section 38 and section 39 organisations grounded on mutual trust and respect.  It is vital that the sustainability issues that threatened the sector before the pandemic and were considerably heightened by the collapse of public fundraising be addressed to ensure these organisations remain a vibrant and essential part of our healthcare system.  There is a need to have effective mechanisms of funding, administration and governance that properly recognise and integrate the specialism and expertise of voluntary organisations in the management of chronic disease within the health system.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, as in countries throughout the developed world, Covid-19 has had a serious impact on access to care and treatment for people with neurological conditions due to the closure and curtailment of services and the redeployment of staff.  However, in Ireland, this impact was exacerbated because neurology and neuro-rehabilitation services were already significantly overstretched and under-resourced before the pandemic.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland will shortly commence a project to examine in depth the hidden impact of Covid-19 on people with neurological conditions, including the impact of delayed or curtailed access to treatment and neuro-rehabilitation services.  There is, however, a clear and immediate indication of the resourcing issues in neurology services evidenced through growing waiting lists and waiting times experienced by patients.  The latest figures available from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, dating from February 2022, show there were 23,815 people on waiting lists for a neurology appointment.  This is by contrast with 13,218 on the waiting list in 2015.  The recently published waiting list action plan commits to a target of ensuring that no one is waiting more than 18 months for an initial outpatient department appointment.  In January 2022, there were 7,587 patients waiting for more than 18 months.  This is an increase from the 4,871 waiters in January 2019, which was before the pandemic.  Reducing this number and actively managing the ever-increasing waiting lists for access to neurology services cannot be achieved without additional investment in resources, especially in the context of Covid-19 backlogs.<\/p> <p>  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland carried out a nationwide audit of neurology resourcing in November 2020.  One of the stark findings that emerged from this audit was the critical shortage of nurse specialists across neurology services.  According to the model of care for neurology services in Ireland, we have an overall shortfall of 100 nurse specialists across neurology services.  What does this mean in practice for the more than 800,000 Irish people living with neurological conditions represented by the member organisations of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland?  It means that four fifths of Irish people living with Parkinson's disease, for example, do not have access to a nurse specialist, while there is an absence of nurse specialists in adult neurology services for complex neurological conditions such as muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease.  This led the alliance to launch its Patients Deserve Better campaign to tackle the shortage of 100 nurse specialists within neurology services.  I pay tribute to the committee members in that I recognise their support for this campaign in their local constituencies since it was launched in October last year.  More than 90 parliamentary questions have been raised on this campaign, and it has been raised on almost 20 occasions in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, including in the form of topical issues and commencement matters.<\/p> <p>  Investing in nurse specialists in neurology services is critical to reducing waiting lists and improving patient care.  We have clear evidence within our health system of the role of nurse specialists in waiting-list reduction and the prevention of hospital admission.  The final evaluation report on the benefit of advanced nurse practitioners, launched by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, in May 2021, notes that an average of 4.3 patients per advanced nurse practitioner are avoiding hospital admission weekly and points to an average reduction of 3.9 patients per week from specialist waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  The neurology clinical programme will make proposals for the 2022 Estimates process that will recommend the recruitment of significant additional numbers of nurse specialists in neurology services, as well as other clinical staff, as part of a five-year plan to implement the model of care for neurology services.  This will require year-on-year investment in what could be up to 20 specialist nurses each year to tackle the shortage of specialist nurses in neurology incrementally.  We request that the committee make urgent representations to the Minister for Health in support of our key ask, which is to increase staffing numbers significantly within neurology services, particularly in specialist nursing, in line with the model of care for neurology and within the lifetime of this Administration.<\/p><p> I sincerely thank Professor Hardiman for supporting the Neurological Alliance of Ireland here today.

It is wonderful that in the course of my professional career we have had a really good career structure for nurses.  Talented clinical nurses no longer have to go into management to progress their careers.  We have clinical nurse specialists, advanced nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners.  The career trajectory for nurses when they come out of college is to undertake general training.  Those who are interested then undergo specialist training at clinical nurse specialist level and can then to extend out to advanced nurse practitioner.  We do not have many advanced nurse practitioners in neurology.  We have some clinical nurse specialists.  The level of expertise or specialisation of the clinical nurse specialists depends a little bit on where they are located.  There are parts of the country where it is appropriate, for example, to have a general neurology nurse specialist, but there are other parts of the country or areas where the service is sufficiently mature that there is far more scope for people to specialise.  For example, we have four specialist nurses in motor neurone disease funded by the HSE.  We need more of them.  Many of our hospitals have multiple sclerosis nurses because that is a relatively mature service, although still under-developed.  Some hospitals have Parkinson's disease nurses.  Some of the underdeveloped regional areas to which I referred have scope to put in neurology nurses who we could then help to support, mentor and specialise as the service grows in the context of the development of this hub model where we have a hub of specialist care providing the whole range of neurological services with a full multidisciplinary team in one of the ten hospitals I mentioned and feeding out into a notional population of 500,000, for example.  The hubs would provide the basic level of care required for people with common or less common neurological conditions, while care for those with rare neurological conditions would be centralised in one or two major hubs of tertiary or quaternary referral.

The Senator spoke about the waiting lists for neurology and the impact of the pandemic and asked what the reasons were for them being so high.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland, in collaboration with the neurology clinical programme, carried out a national audit of neurology resourcing around the country in late 2020.  We waited until late 2020 in order that it would not be impacted by the redeployment of staff.  We were reassured that all staff were back in their normal posts by then.  We compared that with a similar audit we had done in 2015.  We found, very worryingly, that levels of staffing across neurology services had remained relatively static in those five years and had even decreased in some areas, particularly with regard to allied health professionals and the proportion of whole-time equivalents that were available to the neurology services.<\/p> <p>  Neurology staffing, as Professor Hardiman explained, has not kept pace with demand and especially in respect of nurse specialists.  Even where there are nurse specialists in place around the country the case loads for those nurses are far in excess of what they should be.  The recommended case load of patients for a multiple sclerosis nurse is 316 patients.  We found that this is far exceeded, especially in the regional centres, so even if a nurse is in place and it appears on paper that there is a nurse providing a service, often those case loads are unmanageable and an additional post needs to be put in place there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Magdalen Rogers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":670,"content":"<p>It is also important to note that as we develop new treatments - and multiple sclerosis is a very good example of that because there are many treatments for the disease now and it is very much more treatable compared with when I started out in my practice - continued surveillance and engagement with services are required.  Those numbers change all the time.  The ratio of nurses to patients will change because the need will change as well.  These are evolving services and evolving treatments.  It is also true with Parkinson's disease.  We have some new and innovative treatments for Parkinson's disease, for example, deep brain stimulation.  We also have a lot of evidence that engagement with multidisciplinary rehabilitation services can improve outcome and quality of life for people with Parkinson's disease and many of those services would be integrated by nursing specialist services.  That is a real limitation at present in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Our witnesses are very welcome.  I thank them for their presentation.  My first question is more an observation with a question in it.  It relates to waiting lists and the waiting list numbers for neurology.  Often the focus is on the global number of 900,000 people on some form of acute hospital waiting list.  I understand 630,000 are on an outpatient waiting list with 160,000 people waiting over 18 months.  It is useful to go under the bonnet in respect of those figures and look at what impact they have in different specialties.  Neurology is one where the wait times have increased dramatically since 2015.  There are two things happening.  The number of people who are on waiting lists and the number increasing is one thing, but the length of time people are waiting is the critical issue.  If more people are waiting more than 18 months, and there is a threefold or fourfold increase in the numbers waiting over 18 months, that is critical and shows that there is a problem.<\/p> <p>  Separate from the acute waiting lists is the number of people waiting for a diagnosis or access to diagnostics.  Is that a problem in neurology?  There are 230,000 people on a waiting list for a diagnosis.  Is that something the witnesses have encountered in neurology and is it an issue that arises in access to community diagnostics?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#C00600","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":672,"content":"<p>Yes, that is very much a live issue.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.  Looking at the waiting lists for neurology, and we have done some due diligence on this, approximately 25% to 30% of people on the waiting list are there for a headache or headache-type disorder.  Clearly, that is of concern because when people get headaches people think that they might have a brain tumour.  It has been the case up to quite recently that the process of investigating headache would require diagnostics.  If people have health insurance they can buy a scan, but obviously that is not appropriate.  We should be able to provide access to diagnostics for everybody in an equitable way.<\/p> <p>  In the past year or 18 months, the HSE has developed a programme whereby primary care practitioners, through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, can now access diagnostics within the community.  That should start feeding into the need for diagnostic services and specialist opinion.  In addition to that, the development of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation programme should help to reduce the level of the waiting list for that 25% to 30% of people who are waiting because of headache.  Furthermore, when we look at the reason we have waiting lists, we look at thing like the new-to-return ratio in clinics.  That is quite variable as well, depending on the type of clinic.  For some clinics' specialist services it is very appropriate that there would be many return patients, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease or Parkinson's disease being a case in point, but in other instances there might be other ways of managing the disability.  Headache is a good example of that.  Epilepsy is another good example.  We could build a service whereby the other specialty services, particularly specialist nurses, working closely with the voluntary sector, can implement a programme of self care with professional support.  We have been exploring that with the Sl&aacute;intecare-funded migraine programme and have demonstrated that it can be very beneficial.  There is also a programme for epilepsy that does that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I refer to the alliance's recommendations.

In order for a neurological service within the country to work effectively, we need neuro-rehabilitation teams within the community.  We are very much committed to the Sl&aacute;intecare model, but that does not take away from the fact that each of the centres for neurological care to which I referred earlier should also have a full complement of multidisciplinary services.  Specialty services within the hospital sector are required in the acute interaction with patients and also in the chronic management of rare and complex diseases.  There are some models of this working well between the hospital and the community, where there is an outreach service between the hospital rehabilitation service and the community service.  That is a model we should be using.  There is a massive need for community neuro-rehabilitation, but there is also an equal unmet need for hospital-based neuro-rehabilitation within the neurology hubs around the country.

I attended a recent event on Huntington's disease.  In my conversations with the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, the importance of advocacy was made clear.  To have even one or two voices advocating for those suffering from what are termed rare neurologically debilitative conditions is vital.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on the nurse specialists initially and share a personal experience.  My late father passed away in 1995.  He had motor neurone disease.  At that time, the care of patients with motor neurone disease was probably at the stage that the care of Huntington's disease patients is at now.  There was very little available.  I remember one experience that I shared with Ms Rogers yesterday.  My late father had to spend a period of time in St. James Hospital.  We invest a huge amount of trust and faith, and rightly so in many cases, in nurses, but what struck me from his experience there was that the nurses really did not have a clue what the symptoms and manifestations of motor neurone disease were.  That surprised me at the time but it should not have done.  They were completely lost.  That situation has changed considerably as a result of the work of Professor Hardiman.  There is now a course and a pathway for patients with motor neurone disease, assisted I suspect in part by some very high profile individuals who have had personal experience of it.  It has been highlighted a lot in the media but it is not always possible for people with rare neurological conditions to highlight their cases or to have people advocate for them.  <\/p> <p>  What training, over and above general nurse training, do specialist nurses get?  Why are they so vital to the continuing care of people with neurological diseases and how long does that training take?  When they have done that training, how is it applied in hospital settings and community settings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#D01000","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart for his comments on motor neurone disease.  It is probably a very good exemplar of what can be done.  I take the Deputy's point about the tragedy of some people who are in the public domain who developed this condition.  I must also say that the voluntary organisation, the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, IMNDA, was very much instrumental in the development, through Beaumont Hospital, where I work, of a national service for motor neurone disease.  Advocacy is important but commitment and an understanding of the disease is equally so and that was done in collaboration with the IMNDA.<\/p><p> In terms of the types of training we would require for specialist nurses for these rare conditions, the programme for training, as I mentioned to Senator Kyne earlier, is that nurses will train initially at staff level and then at clinical nurse specialist level.  That training is undertaken, to some extent, like an apprenticeship by operating within the system and being mentored by more senior individuals.  The role of the advanced nurse practitioner is one to train and teach as well.  We have very few advanced nurse practitioners at the moment in Ireland but with those that we have, and also the candidate advanced nurse practitioners, much of their remit is to undertake training and the education of younger colleagues and colleagues in other disciplines in order that the experience the Deputy's father and his family had would not be replicated and that people would understand the disease.<\/p><p> There are conditions for which we have not really been able to initiate that type of training programme of which Huntington's disease is a very good example.  Where the condition is complex, where the manifestation or presentation of the condition can be quite chaotic and difficult.  There is also a high risk of falling out of the system and of not being able to access service because of behavioural change.  Understanding the factors that lead to this is really important.  There is a need to train nurses and other healthcare practitioners to understand the chaotic nature of the condition, identify means by which we can continue to care for those people and provide a meaningful service that enhances and improves quality of life for people from the time of diagnosis through to end of life.  Does that answer the question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#D01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Yes.

In fact, we have been working with Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain, the clinical lead in integrated care, on identifying the pathways.  We have set ourselves the task of mapping out pathways for rare neurological diseases.  We have mapped out the motor neurone disease pathway because it is well established, although it still requires some resourcing.<\/p> <p>  The pathway for Huntington's disease and other rare conditions - and we are using Huntington's disease as an exemplar- is much more complicated for a number of reasons.  The services that are required are cross-disciplinary and across a number of different funding structures within the HSE, which is very challenging.  Huntington's disease also comes in under the young onset dementia programme, which is under the remit of the National Dementia Office.  In our consideration of what this might look like, one of the things has been to really determine the need to establish a working group with all of the stakeholders.  That would include the National Dementia Office, the neurology clinical lead, me, representatives from psychiatric services that are hospital-based and community-based, genomics, representatives from the national genetics programme, representatives from palliative care and, finally, representatives from the national physical and sensory disability programme, because with Huntington's disease and similar conditions, where there is a progressive degeneration there is also a need for long-term care.  Many of these people are under the age of 65.  The resourcing that is required comes out of the national physical and sensory disability pot of money, which is under the control of the local regional disability managers and which means that there is a limit to that money.<\/p> <p>  In order for us to develop a programme that is meaningful and impactful, we need to look at the overall cost to manage somebody with a condition like Huntington's disease from the time that he or she is pre-symptomatic and has a gene variant that we know is going to cause the disease, right the way through to end of life.  That is a very big programme that requires many different stakeholders.  It is possible.  We could certainly map it out and we could definitely put a price tag on it.  However, the challenge is going to be how to resource that in the current iteration of resourcing within the health sector, which is, unfortunately, not yet that the money follows the patient, it is being able to dip in an doubt of the various different funding pots that are available, and that leads to many tragic situations.  In conversation with the Deputy, we elucidated one very tragic story of a young man who has fallen out of the system and has nowhere to go.  There is no funding for him to go into long-term care in an appropriate setting.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that we ask this committee to think about these types of overarching strategic developments that would require multiple stakeholders.  We have the support of my colleague, the lead in integrated care, Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain, in this regard to set up a working group with very clear terms of reference, timelines and deliverables to come out with a plan and a price in terms of what it would look like to provide an integrated service for people with Huntington's disease.<\/p> <p>  in the context of Huntington's disease, there is a charitable entity, Bloomfield Health Services, which is located in Deputy Lahart's constituency.  Bloomfield has expertise in dealing with the later stages of Huntington's disease.  We need a system within neurology to allow us to develop high-level service level agreements at national level.  I know from my conversation with representatives from the IMNDA that there is a service level agreement which the IMNDA has with the authorities in Dublin north, but the service and reach are national.  If we are going to do this effectively, we should have a HSE system whereby we can generate an overarching service level agreement with the expert entities that are outside the HSE system but within the voluntary sector, yet are proven to have an expertise and a skill set that is beneficial to patients.  That is very difficult to establish at the moment with the structures we have.<\/p> <p>  There are two things.  One is to develop a system where we commit to the money following the patient, where we can map out what needs to happen and identify a funding source that does not involve seven or eight different funding structures.  The second is where the expertise is available but not within the public sector but within the charitable sector that we can access that expertise with an overarching service level agreement.  Those are the two take-homes from this meeting that I would like to leave with the committee, in addition to the messaging around nurse specialists.  It is the integration of delivery of care between the service that I provide, as a public HSE-funded practitioner, and the integration that I have in my practice as a representative with the voluntary sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":696,"content":"<p>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland is working on a project with the Disability Federation of Ireland supported by the HSE.

I highlight the serious concerns of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland in respect of the fact that, as the Deputy stated, a strategy is in place.  The implementation plan for the strategy was published in 2019.  It was a three-year implementation framework that ended in December 2021.  There has been a dismal lack of progress in terms of putting in place hospital-based inpatient beds and also in developing community neuro-rehabilitation teams.  Deputy Cullinane raised this issue earlier.<\/p> <p>  We have an added concern in respect of the neuro-rehabilitation strategy following on from the Covid-19 pandemic because we believe there is a hidden impact of Covid on access to neuro-rehabilitation services.  Because teams are not in place, there are no waiting lists for those teams.  No one is reporting waiting lists for those community neuro-rehabilitation teams.  We are aware there was a significant amount of closure and curtailment due to staff redeployment in the community for access to the neuro-rehabilitation that there is in place.  That has increased since the pandemic.  There are people who are cocooning or deconditioning, as well as those who were discharged early from acute hospitals for their own safety.  There were no community neuro-rehabilitation services in place to discharge them to, so they effectively missed out on a period of rehabilitation.  There is an entire backlog of care through the past two years.  On top of that, members of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland have reported that there are people with symptoms of long Covid trying to access their services.  There is a perfect storm in the context of neuro-rehabilitation services and, matched with that, a strategy that is not working.  It is not being implemented on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Magdalen Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":708,"content":"<p>How many of the nine CHOs have community teams?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#F01100","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":709,"content":"<p>It is very hard to tell without an effectively running implementation group for the strategy but, to our knowledge, there are three teams in place and up and running.

The HSE has recognised this in the appointment of my colleague Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain as clinic lead in integrated care.  The Deputy is absolutely right that much of what we do in neurology interfaces with many other disciplines.  The patient journey, which is what we should focus on, interacts with many different services in the hospital and community.  We have a commitment to the Sl&aacute;intecare aspiration to maximise engagement at community level and minimise, while retaining quality, engagement in centres where people may have to make long trips with long waiting times.<\/p> <p>  In trying to map out the patient journey in broad brush strokes with the various disabilities we take care of in the clinical lead programme for neurology, my colleagues in the clinically advisory group and I have divided neurological conditions into three major categories.  One is relatively common conditions such as migraine and epilepsy where engagement at community level with good support through specialist nurses is appropriate.  A small proportion of people may need to move to specialist care.  This is primarily in the neurological domain but there are very close interactions with the community. Epilepsy is a very good example of this.  My colleague, Professor Colin Doherty, with funding from the Sl&aacute;intecare pilot programme, also looked at engagement with homeless services.  He worked very closely with general practitioners to try to improve access for vulnerable groups that might otherwise not be able to access services.  This is within a community setting.<\/p> <p>  The middle conditions are not rare but not overly common and require neurological engagement.  Multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease are examples.  Much of Parkinson's occurs over the age of 65 and it is co-managed by colleagues in medicine for the elderly.  Some people with Parkinson's develop neuropsychiatric symptoms and need the engagement of old age psychiatry.  Multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's need rehabilitation, which is in community rehabilitative services.  Parkinson's with cognitive impairment falls under the national dementia strategy.  They may engage with the National Dementia Office services.  This is completely separate to the clinical design programme.<\/p><p>Rare diseases include Huntington&rsquo;s disease and motor neurone disease as well as many others such as muscular dystrophy.  In fact, about 40% of neurology concerns rare diseases.  These require tertiary and quaternary services and many of these people require integration with other disciplines as well, such as psychiatry in the case of Huntington&rsquo;s disease, neuropsychiatry for some forms of motor neurone disease, or palliative care, which is really important, along with community services and implementation of the rehabilitation programme.<\/p><p> The Deputy is absolutely correct, therefore, that the focus on quality care is probably better mediated through the patient journey than through the sub-specialty or discipline.  That is a significant challenge in Ireland because we are very siloed such that a neurologist might work in neurology in a hospital, for example, and therefore not in the community, and someone with a palliative care problem is not really considered to be that neurologist&rsquo;s problem.  In order for us to enhance how we deliver care, we need to consider the journey and the issue of the money following the patient.  The work we are doing with the scheduled care transformation programme involves mapping that out.  Deputy Cullinane asked about community diagnostics, and that is part of the solution.  If a general practitioner can access diagnostics rapidly, that can significantly reduce the wait time in the case of somebody who may have an early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, for example, or somebody who just has a headache and who may not need to come to a specialist service any more.<\/p><p> Examining the programme in the context of the money following the patient is what we are trying to do with respect to the scheduled care programme.  It involves mapping out these four exemplars, namely, rare, ultra-rare, relatively common and common and capable of being managed in the community, and putting a price tag on them in order that we can work out the cost and work out where the resourcing should go in order that, ultimately, the money will follow the patient.  That is the ultimate objective, in my opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#G01700","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":732,"content":"<p>If I could come in there briefly, I re-emphasise the need for the neuro-rehabilitation strategy to be implemented.

Our number is much lower than it should be.  Again, there is inequity in that regard given parts of the country are really poorly served with respect to neurology, as I elucidated earlier.  We really need to build the regional support services.<\/p> <p>  There are good stories here as well.  In Limerick, for example, which is a hub in development, there are now four neurologists, whereas last year there were only two.  Limerick as a region is a case in point of a really good development of a hub for neurological care, but other parts of the country remain very poorly served.

There is definitely a role for managing spasticity, and while the licensing relates to multiple sclerosis, there may be a role for some of the cannabinoid products to treat other types of spasticity.

I understand there have been some delays in the negotiations regarding reimbursement.

It may not be very attractive to somebody who has done training in a national centre in the UK, US or Australia to come back and work in a centre that is poorly resourced and under-developed with respect to the complement of services that are required to provide a quality service.  It is not just a question of the number of people that we have in training nor is it a question of the recruitment to positions.  It is a question of making those positions sufficiently attractive and that is a big challenge in some parts of this country.  We really need to pay attention to that because there have been situations where posts have been advertised and the uptake or the attractiveness of the posts has been such that there have been very few applicants.  That situation is a big concern given the unmet need in this area.  So not only is it a question of the training of people, it is a question of making the posts that are available sufficiently attractive to attract the best and the brightest back.  That is an issue.

I have received many emails, as I am sure other members have, from people lobbying for more neurological nurses.  They kept telling me that there is a delay in diagnosis.  What I am trying to understand is from the time a family GP makes a referral, how long does the pathway to diagnosis take?  I know it is not a catch-all but, typically, how long can it take?  How is the lack of neurological services in public healthcare delaying the typical diagnosis pathway?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#K00800","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":765,"content":"<p>We need to be careful because it depends.  If somebody has a neurological disability that is of concern, there are mechanisms and facilities for general practitioners to access neurological consultations pretty quickly.  The waiting list is triaged.  When a letter comes into a hospital, the letter is reviewed.  If the referral suggests that this is a problem that needs to be investigated urgently, my colleagues and I will triage that to an urgent emergency consultation.  It is not the case that somebody with a potentially very serious or life-threatening condition would wait for the four years for a consultation.  Our general practitioner colleagues are very good at identifying such cases and would make the referral through the appropriate channels and patients will be seen more rapidly.  It is important to say that.  There are situations where it may not be an acute or life-threatening condition where a neurological opinion would be valuable and develop a care plan.  In those instances, from the time of first symptom, depending on the symptom, the general practitioner will make a referral.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, when we audited the types of referrals coming in, across the board in all the hubs we looked at, between 25% and 30% of those referrals were related to some kind of headache syndrome.  In order to address that, we put together a pilot programme to try to reduce the waiting time for those people and maximise the benefit of the consultation.  The headache and migraine programme funded through the Sl&aacute;intecare pilot implementation programme was very successful and it will hopefully be rolled out.  In the process of doing that, we used three hospitals.  We undertook work in each hospital to understand the waiting lists better.  Some hospitals, including in Galway, did a waiting list audit and were able to reduce a significant proportion of people on the waiting list by engaging with patients by telephone.

For the purpose of social distancing, there is a requirement to reduce the number of people in the waiting rooms.  Therefore, that has an impact on the number of people being seen.  For example, in Cork University Hospital, the entire neurology services had to be moved to a different part of the hospital with much reduce capacity.  Most of the hospitals have a capacity problem within outpatient services.  Even if we wanted to see more patients, many of the hospitals do not have the capacity to enable that.  Some hospitals are looking at renting space elsewhere.  For example, Beaumont Hospital has rented space in Northside Shopping Centre.  The hospitals are attempting to improve that situation.

My take-home point from this is that the mid-west is particularly pressured when it comes to neurological services.  I know there has been recruitment and we have gone from two to four neurological nurses but best practice suggests we should have 11 and, somewhere in the middle, there seems to be a settlement that eight are required.<\/p> <p>  When somebody enters undergraduate nursing training, what additional training is required to go from that into the whole realm of neurological nursing?  Without having pay grades in front of us, I presume that as it is an add-on skill, people are paid better.  I have an additional question with regard to neurological consultants, which we have not discussed much today.  Usually, when somebody is in private consultancy, they have a team around them.  Are nurses who are qualified in neurological nursing more attracted to working in the private sphere, where conditions might be better, and is that also a factor that is driving them out of our public hospital system?

For neurological care, the public sector is better.  There is not necessarily a multidisciplinary team within private hospitals.  The private hospitals are within the private sector and they serve a very important purpose in Ireland because of the difficulties we have with capacity.  However, multidisciplinary teams, which is what most people with neurological conditions benefit from, are in the public sector.  People with neurological disability are much better off within the public sector, warts and all.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the training of specialist nurses, as mentioned earlier, it is an attractive career path for nurses.  They come from the staff nurse grade usually to clinical nurse manager, CNM.  There are a number of grades for CNM and then they move on to clinical nurse specialist and then to advanced nurse practitioner.  There is a very clear career path for people in nursing and it is very attractive.  When we recruit for nurse specialists in neurology, we get a good field and there is a lot of interest.<\/p> <p>  Specifically relating to the mid-west, it is a success story and there are a number of reasons why that is.  When I took up the position of clinical lead for neurology, Ms Rogers and I did a tour of the country and visited all of the neurology hubs and chatted with our colleagues about the needs.  One of the things that was very impressive to both of us was the quality of the neurological service in Limerick and the commitment of our colleagues in Limerick to the development of services and the expansion of services.  There is also the commitment of the University of Limerick to the delivery of neurological care and the facilities that are available within University of Limerick in that regard.  Clearly, there is a lot of work to be done with my colleagues, of whom there will soon be four, with the third recently appointed and a fourth coming.  It still needs a lot of investment but it is an area we should look to in order to learn how best to develop original services.<\/p> <p>  The Limerick services are advantaged by a very good neuro-rehabilitation team, with whom they engage closely.  They also benefit from people like Professor Susan Coote, who is linked with the University of Limerick but is also an expert in multiple sclerosis physiotherapy.  Professor Coote was awarded a Sl&aacute;intecare pilot project demonstrating the benefits of virtual rehabilitation for people with multiple sclerosis, and that is being mainstreamed now.

Neurological services were in crisis pre-pandemic but listening to the figure of 24,000 people waiting for neurological appointments now, it is fair to say that we are approaching an emergency situation, if we are not in an emergency already.<\/p> <p>  I am not a member of the committee and I thank the Chair for allowing me to come in to address the witnesses.  As they know, I have met both of them before.  I have a personal interest in neurological conditions, having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 15 years ago.  Listening to Deputy Cathal Crowe, I am reminded of the years prior to being diagnosed and not being treated.  From the point of contact when I went to my GP to when I got my diagnosis, there was a seven-year gap, which is a frightening place for any young man to be - I was 25 years old at the time.  I am in the public system and while I can only speak for my own experience, it is that the services available to me have been scant.  I have had four appointments with my neurologist in the 15 years since I have been diagnosed.  I have had two MRI scans, the first in 2007 and the next in 2018, and I was on a waiting list for all of that time.  I would have been getting letters from the HSE to ask whether I still wish to have the appointment and I was sending every letter back to say that, yes, I still wish to have the appointment.  When I got my appointment in 2018 for my second MRI scan, they could not find the records of my first one because the HSE had changed its administration.<\/p><p>They could not tell in a neurological sense whether the multiple sclerosis had progressed.  I have been on a waiting list to get my next follow-up MRI scan to see if it has progressed since 2018.  That is my experience.  I do not know if it has deteriorated in a neurological sense.  I can only say in a physical sense for myself that I have not felt physically or mentally better in a long time.  I have to say that.<\/p><p> My situation within the public service is not unique, however.  It is an indication of the systemic failures in the system through years of underinvestment in neurology services.  When we see figures showing that 24,000 patients are waiting for an appointment, it is really quite stark and frightening.<\/p><p> I wish to put on the record a word of thanks to MS Ireland for the support I got at the very start when I was first diagnosed.  As a young person, being diagnosed with a neurological condition can be a really frightening place, especially for the young man I was then.  I did not have the ability to articulate how I was feeling.  I did not know how to express that I was frightened for my own and my family's future.  I kind of started to isolate.  I was suffering with depression because of the diagnosis but I did not know I was, which is a really frightening place to be.<\/p><p> The support I received from MS Ireland, which does not get talked about too much, was with regard to counselling.  I gained an acceptance that I have multiple sclerosis.  That was my first step forward to a way of dealing with this.  It does not define me.  At the time, it did, but it does not define me anymore.  It has given me the ability to look at things in a different way.  I kind of take life on life's terms now.  I do not think, for example, that I would be here unless I got that diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, believe it or not.  I was already involved with community activism but I probably would not have taken the chances I took by going to college and other stuff I have done over the years because of the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and because I changed my thinking around it.<\/p><p> I always say to anybody who has been recently diagnosed and who might be listening today that it is not the end of the world.  It is absolutely not the end of the world.  Some of the advice I have given people and talked about a few times is to not do what I did at the start.  Do not ask Dr. Google because Dr. Google will lead you down a bad path to a very dark place where you cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel.  That is where I was.  People should take a chance and talk about their feelings because feelings never hurt anybody.  They should just talk about them and if they have the opportunity to get a bit of professional help with regard to talking about their feelings, they should do that as well.  Those are two bits of practical advice that I found really helped me.<\/p><p> That is enough about me; I will ask some questions.  I have an interest in long Covid especially.  I had Covid and had symptoms for approximately five months afterwards.  Thank God they have cleared now.  We know Covid is a new virus and we are still finding out what it is about.  What early indications have the witnesses seen on the effect long Covid has on neurological conditions but also, as they mentioned already, on neurological services?  Is there a plan for us to address that at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#L00700","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much for his comments on multiple sclerosis.  I am really sorry that he had such a circuitous journey in terms of both his diagnosis and accessing services.  It is not really acceptable that he has been waiting such a long time for a scan.  That should not be happening and probably needs to be investigated as to what the delay is.<br\/><br\/>With respect to long Covid, certainly, we know there is both a very significant neurological and psychiatric impact of Covid-19.  Some work has been done on psychiatry that was published in one of the big journals, namely, <i>The Lancet<\/i>, showing that something like 20% or 30% of people, or even more, suffer either neurological or psychiatric sequelae from the first round of Covid.<br\/><br\/>There is a move to develop a set of long Covid clinics.  Many of the symptoms of long Covid include the need for engagement with infectious disease.  Cardiology and neurology are also parts of it.  We have put the need to develop a number of national long Covid clinics into the Estimates, which would include neurological engagement.  That is currently in progress through the Estimates.  My colleague, Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain, who is clinical lead in integrated care, is committed to this and to the development of long Covid clinics.  A number are up and running already but there is a need to expand that out.<br\/><br\/>It is also important in the context of long Covid to describe another set of neurological conditions because the neurological symptoms of long Covid are not unlike other neurological symptoms we see.  They account for approximately 50% of referrals that we see in neurology, which are people who have a neurological disability for which we cannot identify an anatomical reason.  That is the case in long Covid as well, actually.

It needs, again, much disciplinary care, which includes colleagues in the areas of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, neurology, respiratory illness, cardiology and infectious disease.<\/p> <p>  From a neurology point of view, that sort of multidisciplinary engagement is very close to what we need in these other conditions where the scan might be normal but the person has a very bad disability.  That is called functional neurology.  Part of the development we see in the context of long Covid is to at the same time actually develop services for functional neurology and functional neurological disorders.  In our submission to the Estimates, we reference the need for, again, multidisciplinary integrated care for people with long-term functional neurological disorders.  These people can do very well and get back into living.  We expect that is the case with long Covid as well.  It just takes time and multidisciplinary engagement, including physiotherapy, graded psychological support, psychiatric support, sometimes, and other specialty services in an integrated care setting.

Again, once they are working well these community neuro-rehabilitation teams make an enormous difference.  They are a point of contact for hospitals discharging patients but they also provide that maintenance of people with neurological conditions in the community without them deteriorating or needing a succession of hospital admissions.  The teams are a hub for so many services referring into them and for keeping people with neurological conditions in the community.  The other team is based in the wider Dublin region.  There were two teams funded in CHOs 6 and 7.  The funding was made available.

The difficulty is Sligo is a really well-run, well-functioning hospital.  My colleagues there work really hard and are top-quality neurologists.  However, it does not have an academic link and it is not that well-served with respect to the overall multidisciplinary resourcing.  It does not have a neurophysiologist, who is someone who does electrical studies on people.  It needs a significant investment to make it a proper, well-functioning hub people want to go and work in and then provide that outreach to the north west and a really high-quality service in Letterkenny, which is a very busy hospital as well.  It is really a question of recognising the geographic inequity and the need for substantial investment in neurological services.  I do not just mean neurologists but the whole neurological team and the team of nurses required to make that service fully-functional.

Many neurological conditions get worse as people get older so as the population ages the number will probably increase as well.  We must recognise the geographic terrain as well.  If you are going up to Bloody Foreland and going back to the base in Sligo, that is a very long trip.  It may well be, therefore, that in certain parts of the country the appointment of nurses will be as much a function of the geographic reach they have.  There is a similar issue in Scotland with the Highlands.  The number of people managed by specialist nurses is much smaller because the geographic distance is much greater so you must allow travel time for these people.

We met the risk management part of the HSE and did a submission.  There is a recognition in the HSE of the need for developing neurological services.  We have put in a submission to build on the success of the Sl&aacute;intecare headache programme which looks like it is going to happen.  I understand it is in train now.  There is a recognition now.  If we can generate a good body of evidence and can demonstrate value for money and benefit then the reaction of the HSE is positive.  Demonstrating the need, the roadmap and the evidence of benefit is what is required in the scheduled care programme.<\/p><p>We have been working very closely with them in building those requirements, and we have been getting quite good traction with them in this regard.  As we said at the beginning, we do not expect all of this to get fixed in a year.  This is a work in progress.  A roadmap to where we should be, which includes the development of the neurology hubs and the recognition of the unmet need and the evidence base to support that, is really where we are at the moment.<\/p><p> With respect to this committee and the take-home from this engagement, I go back to the comment that was made earlier and was alluded to by Ms Rogers earlier, it is about recognising the role of the voluntary sector.  We do that at a practical level in that we work very closely.  Deputy Ward also referred to the work of MS Ireland.  We do not integrate the voluntary sector adequately within the delivery of care, but we rely heavily on their resources to deliver services.  I have been in my job for a very long time.  To my mind, it is not acceptable that the essential services we provide for people are funded through fundraising and philanthropic support.  We should really be recognising those services for what they are, which is an essential part of care.  As I said at the beginning, the process of generating a service level agreement is very complex and done at a regional level.  There is no overall overarching mechanism for a national service to develop a service level agreement with the voluntary organisation.  That is a thing we could fix quite easily within the HSE in order to have a system whereby a voluntary organisation that has proven to deliver a high-quality service should be able to have a service level agreement, to support the service they are providing, through the Exchequer.  That is very difficult to do at the moment, as Ms Rogers said.  They are done through very local and regional services within the disability sector.  For example, the IMNDA's service level agreement is with north Dublin but they have four nurses that provide an national outreach who are an integral and integral part of the motor neurone disease service.  That is something we could fix quite quickly by exploring how we could do a national service level agreement, obviously with the important due diligence, evidence of appropriate use of the services, and appropriate governance structures.  That is very doable and we have been exploring that also. That is a take-home message that I would like to put the committee: that we should be able to do that by way of integrating the voluntary section 38 sector organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#N01800","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":806,"content":"<p>Reference was also made to Paul Reid's comments about the importance of building new relationships with section 38 and section 39 organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#O00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":807,"content":"<p>There is a mechanism for that through the ongoing dialogue fora with the voluntary sector on foot of the independent review group on the role of voluntary providers in health and social care services.

If we were to put together a working group with all of the appropriate stakeholders to develop what that would look like, this would be a first.  It would be a demonstrator for how we show that we care about these conditions and it would also show how the money would follow the patient.  It would be relatively straightforward to calculate the overall budget for what would be required there.  The question is, however, where would the budget come from?  Who is going to give the budget for that?  Nobody is going to give the whole budget.  It is going to come from seven or eight different sectors, but nobody wants to give up their budget.  How do we make a system for a complex disease like Huntington's disease?  We would need to ring-fence that and would need to have some kind of overarching mechanism to ring-fence the budget for those patients.  At present, there is no mechanism to do that.  Possibly it could be through the national prevention strategy but the best way to do that would be set up a working group to explore how best to establish that.  That could be used as an exemplar for many of these complex conditions that are spread across many different siloed parts of the HSE where the critical care falls down because one part of that silo no longer has the resources and may have spent all of its money by March.  That put that person falls out of the system there.  That happens a lot in neurological conditions.  That would be a good way to really explore that, by setting up a working group with all of the stakeholders for a complex condition with a massive unmet need such as Huntingdon's disease.  I commend that to the committee, if the committee would be willing to consider that and make some recommendations in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":809,"content":"<p>To go back to the earlier discussion on long Covid, it is the same argument whereby people who have long Covid are saying that it is an infectious disease and also pulmonary and all of the those services.

The difficulty is that one would have to establish that the money is coming from those funding pots.  This has happened in the delivery of medications through hospitals for multiple sclerosis.  We do have a ring-fenced budget that is administered through the primary care reimbursement service.  It is possible to do that where the hospitals contribute a small amount of money and there is no rationing any more of the multiple sclerosis drugs, which there used to be ten or 15 years ago.  There is a wherewithal to do it if we have the will to do it.  It is really important because these are complex conditions and if we rely on the individual budgets within the local sectors, there is a very high likelihood of failure for the delivery of care for these people, unfortunately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022033000002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":811,"content":"<p>Reference was made to the upcoming examination of the hidden impact of the pandemic on services.

We can all read waiting lists and neurology waiting lists, which we can access very easily, but we want to get a sense of whether there is a hidden impact, which we are hearing about directly from patients themselves and also from the organisations we represent.  How does one measure someone who has deconditioned due to not being able to have their physiotherapy and their speech and language therapy during the pandemic?

I work as closely as I can with them to support them in ensuring that they remain and that they can prosper and flourish.  As he outlined, the figures speak for themselves.  The fact that 466 people have applied under this new stream is fantastic considering the number applying in 2019 was 129.  With regard to the 20% target, in the light of the funding we have for 800 garda&iacute; this year alone, without knowing who will be able to complete or be successful in the process and become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 466 applicants in the context of 800 posts certainly gives us a very good chance and an opportunity to reach that 20% target.  I really hope that we will be in a position to do so but, without knowing who of the 10,000 who have applied will reach that stage, I cannot give the Senator a definitive answer.  Given the increase in the number applying this year, I certainly hope we will see an overall increase in Garda numbers.  There is a requirement in legislation for the Garda Commissioner to ensure, insofar as is practicable and possible, that garda&iacute; stationed in Gaeltacht areas are proficient in Irish.  This certainly helps in that regard.  There is also work under way with regard to stations in Gaeltacht service towns.  We are not just looking at the stations specifically within Gaeltacht areas, but also at those that provide services to those areas.  There is a long-term goal to ensure that stations in the Gaeltacht are fully bilingual and that those stations situated outside the Gaeltacht but that serve the area can also provide adequate bilingual services.  Increasing the numbers of garda&iacute; who are bilingual and making sure we continue to provide adequate education and training for those members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are not bilingual but who have a certain amount of Irish will certainly be helpful.  I am hopeful and positive.  These are really positive figures.  Again, notwithstanding the fact that we do not know who will make it through this process and be successful at the end, we are possibly in a situation to reach at least the target of 20% of new recruits being Irish speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#C00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":828,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as sin.

These will finish shortly.  Since 2019, some 39 staff have been supported through the various courses, 24 of whom have progressed through multiple levels of training.  We are not as big a Department as some of the other large Departments so that is a good figure, but obviously we could improve on it.  <\/p> <p>  In our Irish-language scheme, we have published the official Irish version of the 1986, 1997 and 2001 consolidations of the rules of the superior courts.  We are making progress to ensure that work is done not just in our teams within the Department but also in the areas which we govern, in particular around the courts, and that translation work is done there.  The Department has a panel of officials who are always available to answer queries in Irish.  They are given specifically designated badges or are highlighted.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the other services that we provide through Irish, other than the rules of the courts which I have mentioned which have been translated recently, the fact that we do not provide services directly to the public means that we do not have a whole suite of teams that one, perhaps, might also find in other Departments.<\/p><p>It is about making sure that we can deal with the State agencies we work with directly in Irish and that we can respond in Irish.  We also want to ensure we can respond in Irish when dealing with the Oireachtas.  However, we may not have the same levels as other Departments that have that face-to-face element.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#D01000","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":844,"content":"<p>Tuigim &eacute; sin.

The more people apply, the more people will go through the process and be successful at interview stage as well as subsequent stages, which will hopefully increase our overall numbers.<\/p> <p>  It is regrettable that there is a view or a sense that by changing the regulations, there was a downgrading.  That was certainly not the intention.  As regards where this came from, first, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland set out a huge piece of reform which is under way, based on its initial report.  It specifically noted that diversity is vital in any organisation, but particularly in an organisation such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that needs to be innovative, adaptable and representative of the communities it supports.  The need to have Irish as a second language was seen as a barrier to many people when applying to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  Prior to the change in the regulation, the numbers were not increasing.  I am not sure whether people were encouraged to come forward just because it was a mandatory requirement.  The way people are encouraged to come forward, be it in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other agency or organisation, is by engaging with them, making sure there is a clear plan and strategy, and supporting them in the development of their language.  I believe that is what we have tried to do here and what the Garda Commissioner is trying to do with the new Irish-language strategy.  During our campaigning in recent weeks since the beginning of the year, there were specific call-outs to people in Gaeltacht areas and beyond, encouraging them to come forward and to consider An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, more so than we have done before.  If people looked into it, they could see that there was a clear plan, that Irish speakers were being considered and that there was a clear strategy for them within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That in itself is very positive.<\/p> <p>  Making something mandatory does not necessarily mean you will get the outcome you want.  Going by the figures, we have seen some progress.  Obviously, until we see the numbers of those who get through the interview process and are successful in the end, that remains to be seen.

As the Deputy has said, I and others believe the increase in numbers has happened for a number of different reasons, including communications and outreach.  What was happening before clearly was not working, we were not seeing those numbers increase in the way we wanted and this requirement was preventing others from applying.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland engaged across the board with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Inspectorate, the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and communities and tried to get a picture of the Garda, its work and its structures.  The Garda itself would have an idea of the composition of its membership but it also went out to other communities and asked them why the members of those communities were not applying.  This included under-represented communities, and what came back from many of them was they did not have Irish and the fact that Irish was mandatory was preventing them from applying.  Having it as a mandatory requirement did not discourage nor encourage Irish speakers from applying but it did discourage others from applying.  In trying to create a diverse police force and in trying to ensure the Garda represents and is reflective of the communities it represents, this was seen as a barrier.  It was as simple as some research from asking communities and garda&iacute; speaking to people.  That fed into what was highlighted in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We need to rethink how we engage with Gaeltacht areas and Irish speakers and we need to learn lessons from this recruitment campaign.  If possible, we need to try to understand why people have applied.

The Deputy made a point about Letterkenny and this is a Garda station that will be a service station and a training station.  Those who are going to Letterkenny will have an opportunity to learn their essential policing skills and to make use of their Irish-language skills, which is welcome and the Deputy has been passionate about making sure that happens.  It is important those who are not fluent Irish speakers and who go into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na always have an opportunity to improve, learn and become Irish speakers where they are not at all, and that is where the Irish-language strategy comes into play.  It is about encouraging more people who can speak fluently, who can teach others and who can converse with the public, be it on the ground, in our communities, going to courts or in other areas.  There must be continuous ways in which people can improve, with online learning being an option, and that is something the Commissioner and the Garda are making available to people.  At the same time, you cannot beat face-to-face physical contact and conversation and it is important those options are available to people.<\/p> <p>  Thinking ahead, there is an option or an opportunity as we develop our community safety partnerships .  There are three pilots under way in Dublin inner city, Waterford and Longford, and this is about making sure communities feel safe and take charge of the policing and safety plans in their areas.  Where these expand beyond the pilot areas, members of the Gaeltacht areas would potentially be included in these community safety partnerships.  They could work closely with the Garda and other members of the group to make sure people in Gaeltacht areas are supported in the same way as everybody else through the Irish language.  It is about making sure it is incorporated into every aspect of the work An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing and spreading it out into the community as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#G00400","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":868,"content":"<p>Bogfaimid chuig an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Donnghaile, ach sula thosna&iacute;onn s&eacute;, aithn&iacute;m go bhfuil an Teachta O&rsquo;Dowd tar &eacute;is teacht isteach sa chruinni&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#G00500","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":869,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus roimh a cuid chomhghleacaithe.

My apologies in advance as I will relay my opening statement in English because my Irish is not strong enough.  I am joined today by my colleagues: Tony Canavan, CEO, Saolta Hospital Group; Cuim&iacute;n Mac Aodha Bhu&iacute;, head of the Irish-language service in the HSE; Mark Brennock, national director of communications; and Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald, specialist in public health, HSE national social inclusion office.<\/p> <p>  The HSE attended this committee in November 2021 and gave an update on our work to provide information and services in Irish and our implementation of our Irish-language strategy.  The HSE has some ground to make up in this area, as the committee is aware.  I regret the opportunities missed to adopt and implement a scheme under the previous Act.  We are renewing our commitment to work to meet our duties under the updated legislation from now on.  We want to use the good work done during the Covid-19 period as a platform for that improved service to Irish speakers.<\/p> <p>  In December, the committee asked that I attend to discuss videos produced by the HSE in 12 languages of migrant communities to encourage uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine.  The committee also asked to discuss generally the languages in which the HSE provides information to the public.  Let me first address the context of the videos for our migrant communities.  In the course of the pandemic, very clear at-risk groups emerged along with evidence of groups less likely to take up the vaccines.<\/p><p>We noted especially low vaccine uptake rates of 26% for nationals of EU 14-27 countries working in sector A, which includes agriculture, forestry and fishing.<br\/><br\/>In response, the HSE&rsquo;s social inclusion team worked on measures to ensure that Covid-19 advice and vaccine promotion messages were adapted for those communities representing lower uptake rate or higher levels of ICU admissions.  These programmes included creating videos in the languages spoken by at-risk communities who are unlikely to be served by traditional channels or information in English or Irish.<br\/><br\/>For this particular purpose, neither English- nor Irish-language versions of these videos were required.  There is an English-language version on the website to act as a reference, but this was not promoted or used as part of the campaign.  We are very proud of our partnership with Translate Ireland, which has worked with us to reach people that are not well served by our traditional communications campaigns.<br\/><br\/>Let me address the provision of services and information in the Irish language, focusing on our Covid-19 communications over the last two years.  Our mainstream communications campaign during the pandemic used a wide range of mass media channels to reach the public.  Both the English and Irish languages were included in our daily news and media interviews with HSE leaders; social media messages from the HSE; HSE Live, our Covid-19 phone information service; <i>hse.ie<\/i>, the main source of advice and information; advertising campaigns on TV, radio, newspapers, posters and cinemas; Google search advertising and digital advertising on websites and HSE booklets delivered to all households.<br\/><br\/>The Saolta hospital group has also carried out extensive Irish-language communications during Covid-19, including social media and news media communications and a dedicated section on its website, along with information sheets and walk-through videos for vaccination centres in Gaeltacht areas.<br\/><br\/>Members will already be aware that many of the above channels have seen a much greater proportion of Irish-language messaging, since the pandemic began, than our previous norms.  We have seen enhanced levels of Irish-language activity on social media and our Covid-19 television and radio adverts were produced in both languages and aired on television on TG4.<br\/><br\/>The HSE website, <i>hse.ie<\/i>, has been the main source of reliable information for the public and with the support of the HSE Irish-language service, 108 pages of Covid content are provided in Irish.  HSE Live, our phone support service, has Irish-speaking operatives to allow registration for the Covid-19 vaccine through Irish.<br\/><br\/>Substantial HSE information booklets on Covid-19 were produced bilingually and delivered to all households in Ireland in 2020 and again in 2021.  Our Covid-19 vaccine information booklets have been produced in English and in Irish from the outset of the programme, with updates to the text and translations being carried out each week since December 2020.  These booklets are all available on the HSE website and printed copies are also made available.<br\/><br\/>We have taken many opportunities to provide an unprecedented level of advertising and patient information through Irish during the pandemic and will extend this to other topics in line with the new legislation.  We also acknowledge, as discussed in our November attendance here, that some opportunities to advance our vision for the Irish language as detailed in our strategy have been missed during this period.<br\/><br\/>We have addressed the availability of our online applications connected to Covid-19, such as the vaccination portal and the systems used to book antigen tests, and to book a vaccine or Covid-19 test in Irish.  I am happy to say that all these systems are now available through Irish on <i>hse.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Our plans to improve and extend our public information in Irish include providing a high-quality user experience and up-to-date content on the HSE&rsquo;s website.  We have begun the process of developing a semi-automated process with a high-quality translation service to ensure accuracy.  The initial scope of this project is to enable the HSE website to be multilingual and to provide Covid-19 and Covid-19 vaccination information on <i>hse.ie<\/i>in Irish in the first place.  We aim to have this in place by the end of April.<br\/><br\/>Looking forward, we will ensure we meet the upcoming legislative requirements placed upon us by the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021.  This will include appointing a new senior manager to lead the process.  The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has told us it will be in touch with us with regard to the commencement of the new legislation and will run information sessions for public bodies.  We look forward to participating fully and to further improving the services we provide in Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":903,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach for the invitation.

We were invited here, along with our colleagues in the HSE, to discuss the various languages through which the HSE and the Department of Health provide and advertise their services to the public, with particular reference to the Irish language.<\/p> <p>  This committee has examined our record on the provision of services through Irish in a detailed way in recent sessions which were attended by my colleagues.  I acknowledge the feedback we received on foot of those conversations and debates.  We have moved to correct mistakes which have occurred in the context of our response to the pandemic and to ensure that our services are available in Irish for those who require it.  I am happy to report that, as a Department, we have further strengthened our capacity to manage correspondence and to provide for services in Irish, for those who require or desire it.<\/p> <p>  Our efforts to incorporate Irish into our response to the Covid pandemic have been examined in detail by the committee during the most recent meeting between officials and this committee.  We have learned lessons and we have strengthened our capacity to ensure that the needs of Irish speakers are accommodated in our response to the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  With regard to digital Covid certificates, a bilingual online portal has been available since August 2021, where people can arrange for changes and corrections to their certificates, among other things.  We have seen a substantial take-up of this service, as Gaeilge, by members of the public since its launch, with thousands of citizen interactions with our service centre and online webchat.<\/p> <p>  With regard to public health notices and health promotion materials, I can confirm that the Department made every effort to fulfil the obligations of the Official Languages Act 2003 during an extremely challenging time for the Department.  All printed materials created by the Department were available bilingually at the same time.<\/p> <p>  The Department regularly posted public health advice across social channels in Irish and in English and statements from the Chief Medical Officer and deputy chief medical officer, outlining and reiterating the public health advice, were available bilingually on the Department&rsquo;s website soon after publication.  All printed advertisements placed in regional and national newspapers by the Department were also available bilingually.  The Department&rsquo;s press office continues to provide a service in Irish to Irish-language media.<\/p> <p>  In our commitment to health service improvement and to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, we will have opportunities to refresh our approach to the delivery of services in Irish and in other languages besides English.  In the coming week, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will be bringing a plan to the Government for the introduction of regional health areas.<\/p> <p>  A key objective of the regional health areas is to ensure the delivery of health and social care services consistent with the needs and requirements of the local population.  It is envisaged that this will permit a fresh approach to the provision of services in Irish and in other languages consistent with the evolving requirements of households and communities at regional level.<\/p> <p>  As accounting officer of the Department of Health, I ensure that my officials are aware of all their responsibilities, including as regards the provision of services in Irish.  I am satisfied that this is an area in which we, as a Department, have been able to greatly improve over recent years and we are now in a position where we can manage all departmental business through Irish or English, as desired.  We learned a lot through the pandemic and learned from our mistakes.<\/p> <p>  We are committed to working with the HSE, in particular, to ensure that health service reform takes sufficient account of language needs in the design and roll-out of services.  I look forward to engaging with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#M01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":920,"content":"<p>Is &eacute; sin an d&aacute; r&aacute;iteas thosaigh.

I will mention again where our focus was.  We had very good information based on geography and population across the country but, as we reached high levels of vaccine uptake in the primary programme, we became concerned about vulnerable groups and non-Irish groups in particular.  Our approach involved a number of languages, which my colleague will outline.  While, as I said in my opening statement, we targeted particular languages, I acknowledge that we recorded a version in English, which was put up on our site.  In hindsight, we should have recorded an Irish version as well.  However, as Dr. Fitzgerald will outline, the target population was very clear because of the vulnerabilities and exposure among those groups.  We did make progress through that communications campaign.  I will ask Dr. Fitzgerald to list the specific groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":926,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach.  In our national office for social inclusion, our remit includes those who are socially marginalised or excluded from mainstream society.  This includes groups such as Travellers, Roma, people in direct provision, homeless people, people affected by addiction and irregular migrants.  In the course of our work during the Covid pandemic, we saw how much Covid outbreaks were affecting those who are most excluded and who are, as I used to say, not necessarily watching the news on RT&Eacute; at night or reading the mainstream media.  When the roll-out of the vaccination campaign started, we were acutely aware that we needed to think outside the box.  I wrote a paper with my colleagues in mid-2021 highlighting how we needed to reach out to vulnerable migrants.  Even though we knew there was a focus on giving people access to vaccination based on medical vulnerability in line with the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, we knew that not everyone in society could get access easily and that a pathway needed to be opened for several of these groups.  Access issues could relate to language, physical distance, the lack of a car, distrust in society or distrust in the vaccination message.  Through our research and ongoing work, we could see that the level of uptake of vaccination among some communities in Ireland, particularly multi-ethnic communities, was very low even as their cohorts were offered vaccination.  That was the main driver of the production of these videos.<\/p> <p>  The first indication that we needed to do something different was that pregnant women were very hesitant to take up vaccination. Our colleagues on the ground, and GPs in particular, who were already working with Translate Ireland, an organisation that started up after the beginning of the Covid pandemic, suggested that we produce video material in the languages of certain communities, especially the languages of eastern Europeans, Brazilians and people coming from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, to be delivered by healthcare workers from their own countries so that they could hear the voices of their own communities.  We felt that written material did not suit these communities and that they had to be given something they could see and hear in a video or multimedia format, that is, something that could be shared on WhatsApp.  They were our main motivations.  <\/p> <p>  The languages we initially picked were Arabic, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Romanian and Urdu.  We then moved on to Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian, Georgian, Somali, Czech and Slovak.  Ukrainian was added latterly to meet the needs of the Ukrainian community that has just arrived.  We picked the top 11 languages based on the numbers of people we had in the community and the numbers of people in direct provision, another group that was greatly affected by the Covid pandemic.  We picked a mixture.  Obviously, not all ethnic minorities are excluded socially but many work in low-paid industries.  We picked the languages based on the communities, their context and the hesitancy and lack of access that we could see from our statistics.  English was picked as an audit tool to make sure we knew that what we were translating was correct.  That is why we did not look at doing one for the Irish-speaking community at that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":927,"content":"<p>Tuigim go raibh na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; ag r&aacute; nach raibh &eacute;ileamh &oacute; ghr&uacute;pa&iacute; ar leith.

However, it was not promoted or used as part of a campaign to pregnant English-speaking women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Brennock"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":937,"content":"<p>Tuigim go raibh na f&iacute;se&aacute;in d&eacute;anta chun d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar ghr&uacute;pa&iacute; nach raibh &eacute;ileamh acu ar an vacsa&iacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#O00400","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":938,"content":"<p>We had concerns when hospital admissions and admissions to intensive care were higher and were notable among those who were not vaccinated and in pregnancy.

This is a rapidly evolving situation.  The HSE website is the first port of call.  The address is <i>www.hse.ie\/ukraine<\/i>.  On that page, there are multiple resources in Ukrainian and Russian.  We are also reaching out to the Ukrainian medical community and the Ukrainian community in general.  Mr. Reid is overseeing a large HSE response.  We have multiple work streams.  Within social inclusion, we have social inclusion managers and workers at local level reaching out to those in the communities and in accommodation provided by the international protection accommodation services of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The challenge is that there are more than 120 new accommodation facilities for Ukrainians.  They are in many rural parts of the country, including in some hotels that have never had experience of being a direct provision facility.  We are working hard with our partners in Government and in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Mr. Reid is probably also working with local authorities and the Civil Defence.  There are multiple ways to engage, including through NGOs.  At primary care level, there is a significant initiative in place to support GPs.  The HSE has rapidly developed an interpretation and translation service that will also be available on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022033000002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":962,"content":"<p>We have a group, which I chair and which meets once a week, overseeing the complete response from the HSE.  That includes all of the services Dr. Fitzgerald has outlined.  We have appointed a national public health lead to interface with all of the services because there are obviously certain public health needs, which we have already identified.  I do not want to be seen to be profiling but one of the immediate public health needs we have seen is the low uptake of immunisation and vaccination among people from many eastern European countries.  I refer not only to Covid vaccination, but also to other immunisation programmes.  That is one but there are other areas we have already identified.  The route to market or how to address these issues is through the group of senior officials from across Departments, which also meets weekly.  We take general direction from that group but, ultimately, our interface is through our services in the community and reaching populations, particularly the Ukrainian populations that have been placed in quite rural locations in these early stages.

I am pleased today to continue our discussion of the priority item on the committee's work programme, which is our continued consideration of the proposed national action plan on the development for the islands from the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p> <p>  The committee welcomes the opportunity to discuss sustainable energy on our offshore islands.  The 2021 climate action plan sets out a roadmap to ensure up to 80% of our electricity will come from renewable sources by 2030.  When I was Minister with responsibility for energy, I insisted that Ireland, along with the European Commission and 13 other member states, sign up to the clean energy for EU islands initiative, not only to provide a reliable and sustainable electricity supply to our offshore islands but also, if managed properly, to ensure it could provide seed capital for a new wave of community enterprise, making our islands not only environmentally sustainable but also economically sustainable.<\/p><p>As members will know, the establishment of an offshore renewable development authority to drive the sector forward in a strategic manner was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann through a motion that I tabled last December.<\/p><p> The objective of this is to establish an offshore renewable development authority, similar to the Industrial Development Agency Ireland model, that will drive a fully co-ordinated national action plan and will have responsibilities ranging from research and development and supply chain development to the commercial deployment of renewable energy and ensure that Ireland that, as a whole, becomes the leading global clean energy exporter.<\/p><p> With the ongoing war in Ukraine and rising inflation driven by spiralling energy costs, we are now witnessing how important it is to strategically develop Ireland's offshore energy capacity, not only to drive down the cost of electricity in the longer term and to create jobs in the renewable energy sector, but to supply clean, green energy to the EU as a whole.<\/p><p> In this regard, I welcome Mr. Philip Newsome, Mr. John Finnegan and Mr. Rory Somers from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications; and Mr. Dara &Oacute; Maoildhia and Ms Avril N&iacute; Shearcaigh from the Aran Islands Energy Cooperative.<\/p><p> Before we commence, witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses participating remotely outside the precincts of Leinster House today are reminded that parliamentary privilege does not apply in this case and the same level of caution should be applied as previously mentioned.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> I call Mr. &Oacute; Maoildhia to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#A00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>Maidin mhaith.  Is mise Dara &Oacute; Maoildhia, cathaoirleach Chomharchumann Fuinnimh Oile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann Teoranta, CFOAT.  Buna&iacute;odh muid in 2012, thart ar dheich mbliana &oacute; shin, agus t&aacute;imid ag obair ar son na tr&iacute; oile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann, Inis O&iacute;rr, Inis Me&aacute;in, agus Inis M&oacute;r.  T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; 100 scairshealbh&oacute;ir againn faoi l&aacute;thair agus t&aacute;imid ag m&eacute;ad&uacute; gach uile l&aacute;.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh gach uile dhuine agus ghn&oacute; ar na hoile&aacute;in mar scairshealbh&oacute;ir amach anseo.<\/p> <p>  Our vision is to convert all three Aran Islands to renewable energy.  Ultimately, we want to own and manage our own microgrid.  We want 100% conversion and control.  We believe that we can convert our island economies from reliance on tourism, which is fickle, as we found out during Covid, to a more solid foundation of the community owning our own renewable energy, which is all around the islands.  This will serve to preserve our population, our language and our heritage, all of which is of supreme value, and create quality employment for our young people. <\/p> <p>  We want the Government to regard our offshore islands as lighthouses for the energy transition.  Ireland&rsquo;s islands are at the forefront and are leading the way.  If our islands, especially off the west coast, were designated as the forerunners and pioneers of the energy transition, we may then get more support to achieve this in a speedy manner.  The EU has done this with its clean energy for EU islands initiative, where it gives advice and support, including financial support, consultancy and expertise to all the islands throughout Europe.  The Government could do the same for our islands and that would help everybody.<\/p> <p>  We have three legs to our stool or three different areas on which we work.  The first is the retrofitting of buildings.  In that, we have been quite successful.  There are only approximately 500 buildings on the three Aran Islands in total.  According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, 300 of them have now had some energy-efficiency upgrades.  That is a pretty high ratio.  That is not just insulation; it is also photovoltaic, PV, panels and heat pumps, of which there are now quite a number on the three islands.  However, extra supports are needed to keep this going.  I will explain that later.<\/p> <p>  Our second leg of work is the electrification of transport.  At present, we have approximately 20 electric cars, an electric minibus and numerous electric bicycles.  We are certainly moving more in that direction.  The bigger challenge is to convert the ferry boats and maybe even the fishing boats to renewable energy.  We are working on research projects, funded through the EU, to convert the ferries to hydrogen.  Some of the local ferry companies are very interested and keen to work with us on that.<\/p> <p>  The third leg to our stool is the generation of our own renewable energy.  We have been working on that for the past ten years and we have just achieved a grid offer for a small turbine on Inis Me&aacute;in.  That is a real breakthrough.  We are also working on a number of offshore projects in tandem with other groups and partners that will produce offshore wind energy off the west coast.  We are also involved in European-funded research to do with hydrogen for our ferryboats, in particular.<\/p> <p>  I would like the committee to understand the challenges we face as island communities because they are very real for us.  The first is the extra cost of getting work done on islands.  To create a level playing field, we need extra support, not because we are greedy but because we cannot get work such as this done, unless it is more attractive to contractors to come out to work for us.<\/p> <p>  All the supplies for our islands are delivered to a cargo vessel in Galway.  If a member of the committee or anybody else living on the mainland gets a delivery from a supplier, the supplier often does not even charge for the delivery and they get it to the door.  Our delivery comes to a cargo boat in Galway and we then have to pay the carriage, including VAT, to get it to our island.  Even there, it lands on the pier and we have to pay further costs to get it brought from the pier up to wherever the work is taking place.  That is a real extra cost of approximately 10%.<\/p> <p>  The second is that we have considerable difficulty in getting contractors to do work on islands.  Our populations are so small that we do not have contractors living among our community who are SEAI-registered and, therefore, can work on the SEAI grant programme.  This means that when we want to get SEAI work done, we have to bring in a contractor from the mainland.  However, as the committee well knows, there is more work than contractors out there at present.  Contractors can pick and choose the most lucrative and attractive jobs.  Unfortunately, jobs on islands are neither lucrative or attractive.<\/p> <p>  I will give the committee a clear example.  The contractor wants to bring his truck out to one of the Aran Islands.  He has to deliver the truck to Galway docks.  It then might take a day or two to be delivered to the island.  Meanwhile, the driver of the truck has to travel another 40 km from Galway to Rossaveal to get the passenger ferry out.  He cannot travel with his truck.  There is a very high cost to bringing a truck out to the islands on the cargo vessel.  When he gets to the island, he has further expense, because he does not have anywhere safe or sheltered to store his materials.<\/p> <p>  If his workers come out to the island on the morning of their job, they will not start until 11.30 a.m. or 12.00 p.m., because they will have to come in on the morning ferry.  If they are leaving again that afternoon, they will have to leave at 4.30 p.m. or, at the latest, 5.00 p.m.  They do not do a full day's work.  If they stay overnight, they have the cost of overnight accommodation and often, accommodation is not available, because we are such a tourist-attractive place.  These are considerable difficulties for contractors.  It is why they do not want to come to our islands and why we need extra grant support.<\/p> <p>  We also have other problems about which I am not sure the committee can do much.<\/p><p>It is therefore very difficult to do any development on the islands.  We would like county development plans to designate areas on each of the islands as suitable for renewable energy developments, whether theses be turbines, solar arrays or something else.<\/p><p> We also have a problem with our underwater cable.  I believe this will be a problem for every island off the west coast.  The cable is not big enough to carry anything worthwhile in terms of exporting energy so, despite our ambitions to generate energy, we have very limited capacity to export it.  The cable under the water to the three Aran Islands is a 3 MW cable.  The ESB has told us that, if we want to generate our own energy, it will only allow us to export 650 kW, which is only a small fraction of the cable's capacity.  Apparently, we need a dedicated cable for export.  We are asking the Government to consider laying a 10 MW cable that would be capable of exporting large amounts of electricity generated on the islands.  When our exported electricity gets to the mainland, we have to get a grid connection.  This depends on the capacity of the local substation.  There are also real limitations there.<\/p><p> As the committee will know, the Government has set up a renewable energy support scheme, RESS, which includes a special category for communities.  That is great and we are very happy with that but there are some problems with it, partially because it is still in development.  We are trying to push ahead on the islands and are being held back by the fact that all of the supports are not in place yet.  For example, the ESB has now offered us a grid connection for a wind turbine on Inis Me&aacute;in.  It has given us two years to get planning permission.  Once that is secured, we can go ahead and make the connection.  However, getting planning permission within those two years is very challenging for us because we first have to raise the money to pay for the feasibility study required to get the planning permission.  We are being held up at the moment because we are trying to raise that money.  The application to the LEADER programme will also take a long time.  We are quite worried we will not make it within the two years.  If we do not, we will lose our offer of a grid connection and go to the back of the queue again.  We would like the offer to last three years rather than two.  We do not have any influence with the ESB.  Perhaps somebody else here does.<\/p><p> We would also like the SEAI to move as quickly as possible in putting supports in place for us.  It is talking about giving us soft loans, which would be a great help in getting the feasibility study done.  A soft loan means a loan that is paid back if the project goes ahead but that is not paid back if the project collapses, perhaps because of being refused planning permission.  We are hoping that will come through quickly but, unfortunately, we need it now.<\/p><p> One of the big opportunities in the future will be offshore wind energy.  We are very clear on the islands, as I believe are people on all of the western islands, that we want to be fully involved in the offshore wind projects.  We do not just want to have community benefit funds throwing money at us.  That is fine but we want a lot more involvement than that.  There are great opportunities for all of the western islands in these offshore wind developments.  There are opportunities for the development of our harbours, our boating skills, and capacities and employment, and for the whole development of the islands, the western region and the ports associated with our islands.  We are most associated with the port at Ros an Mh&iacute;l, which definitely needs to be developed as part of all of this.  We see very significant opportunities here but we need to be supported in seeking the maximum benefit from these offshore projects for our islands and coastal community.<\/p><p> We would like legislation to be passed that would require developers of offshore projects to engage with the local island and coastal communities to maximise local benefit and which would also require such projects to offer some type of partial ownership to coastal communities and islands, either in the form of shares or contracts allowing us to take on part of the work of looking after the offshore wind project, in other words, that we be given priority.<\/p><p> There is also a real opportunity to develop hydrogen production arising from these offshore wind developments.  We are very keen to progress with that.  We are involved in a number of European research projects connected with that.  We are also involved with some of the other islands around the west coast.  We represent the Aran Islands but we are involved with Valentia and Achill in planning a project to produce hydrogen from offshore wind energy.  This is another opportunity for the Government to designate supports for islands and coastal communities in the facilitation of hydrogen production from offshore wind energy.<\/p><p> Mar fhocal scoir, t&aacute; t&uacute;s &aacute;ite ag na hoile&aacute;in amach &oacute; ch&oacute;sta thiar na h&Eacute;ireann san aistri&uacute; fuinnimh n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in in &Eacute;irinn, ach san Eoraip.

I am the principal officer responsible for renewable electricity in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. John Finnegan, who is the principal officer for the electricity networks and systems division, and Mr. Rory Somers from our retail energy policy and regulation division.  We will use our opening remarks to address the topic of community sustainable energy for our offshore islands and, in particular, the opportunities for renewable electricity generation as well as a number of specific issues related to the electricity network the committee has indicated it would like to discuss.<\/p> <p>  The climate action plan sets out a roadmap for taking decisive action to ensure up to 80% of our electricity will come from renewable sources by 2030.  In this context, a key priority is enabling citizen and community participation in the energy transition across the country, including in rural communities on our offshore islands.  There are a range of measures outlined in the climate action plan to increase the scale of the roll-out of renewables on the grid to achieve help these aims.  I will highlight a few areas that are relevant to the topic of today&rsquo;s meeting. <\/p> <p>  The renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, is an auction-based support scheme to support the roll-out of grid scale renewable electricity.  The first RESS auction, RESS 1, for onshore wind and solar energy projects successfully concluded in September 2020 with 63 projects progressing through delivery milestones to energisation by the end of 2023.  Following on from that first auction, a second RESS auction is scheduled to take place in May 2022 with further onshore and offshore auctions planned.<\/p> <p>  A core aspect of the RESS is the provision of pathways for communities to participate in renewable electricity generation.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has developed a number of toolkits and a trusted intermediary service to begin to assist communities in the development of their own projects.  The first four of these toolkits, covering grid connections, solar photovoltaic, PV, technology, the planning process and onshore wind energy, are available on the SEAI website, with more to be developed in the coming months.  A trusted intermediary service is also now in place to assist community projects.  A trusted advisory service for expert financial, grid and planning advice and financial enabling grant supports is also to be delivered in the second quarter of this year.<\/p> <p>  Micro and small-scale generation will also have a key role to play in helping us to achieve our overall renewable electricity and climate targets and will allow island citizens and communities to take part in the energy transition.  In that respect, the introduction of the clean export guarantee tariff represents the first phase of a comprehensive enabling framework for micro and small-scale generators in Ireland.  It allows them to receive payment from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflecting the market value of the electricity. <\/p> <p>  The micro-generation support scheme approved by Government on 21 December 2021 provides capital grants for new domestic installations and will provide grants for new small non-domestic solar PV installations later this year. Larger non-domestic users, including farms, businesses, schools and community buildings, that install new larger installations can avail of a clean export premium tariff, which will provide a fixed tariff for 15 years for electricity exported to the grid in conjunction with the clean export guarantee.<\/p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators above 50 kW but smaller than those supported by the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS.  This is being progressed this year and is expected to become available in by early 2023.  This scheme will enable larger businesses, farms and community projects to maximise their participation in the energy transition.<\/p><p> In addition to these measures, through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the clean energy for EU islands initiative, our rural island communities can be part of the clean energy transition of the more than 2,200 inhabited European islands.  We currently have 12 of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore islands as member communities across the sustainable energy communities network.  I will move over now and I call on my colleague, Mr. Finnegan, to talk about the electricity grid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Newsome","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>Moving to the electricity network, the transformation required to meet the up to 80% renewable electricity target we have set ourselves by 2030 will require significant investment in the grid.  Recognising this, in 2020 the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, the energy regulator responsible for oversight of national electricity grid costs, sanctioned a total of &euro;4 billion in capital investment spend on the grid over the 2021-2025 period.  EirGrid and ESB Networks are using these funds to accommodate the high level of renewables being added to the system as well as the increased demands from the electrification of our heat and transport sectors.<\/p> <p>  In general, new and enhanced grid connections are provided in response to new investments in renewable generation.  The Enduring Connection Policy programme from CRU sets out the framework for providing these connections to new generation projects.  This programme provides for 115 connection applications to be processed by ESB Networks and Eirgrid each year from 2021 to 2023.  At least 15 of these applications are reserved for community projects.  Further applications, up to a total of 30, are reserved for micro projects with a maximum capacity less than 500 kW or self-supply projects.<\/p> <p>  We understand and have heard from the co-operative itself that the members of the committee are anxious to ensure the grid will be upgraded as necessary to allow electricity to be exported from islands to the mainland.  This will include the upgrade of the connection from the islands to the mainland and any further grid upgrades from thereon.  The intention of the Enduring Connection Policy programme is that the grid will be upgraded in exactly this way as and when needed to facilitate renewable generation on the islands, or indeed, anywhere where there is potential for renewable power.<\/p> <p>  The possibility was raised with the Department by the committee of dual-purpose investments to upgrade water and electrical connections at the same time.  As described, an upgrade to a grid connection would be considered when there is a new renewable generation project in train.  If the grid connection was being upgraded the potential to carry out work for water at the same time would have to be considered in detail at that time.<\/p> <p> In response to some questions and comments I will give an overview of who we are and of who the other bodies we are referring to are.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is responsible for the delivery of policies and programmes in a large number of areas, including energy security, natural resources, climate action, energy efficiency, communications and waste.<\/p> <p>  Eirgrid is a State-owned company under the aegis of the Department that develops and operates the electricity transmission grid.  This transmission grid connects large-scale generators and users and bulk supply points near cities and towns.<\/p> <p>  ESB Networks is a division of the ESB.  ESB is also under the aegis of the Department.  ESB Networks finances, builds and maintains the transmission grid that has been designed by and is operated by Eirgrid.  In addition, it carries out all the functions relating to the electricity distribution system, which includes the planning, construction, maintenance and operation of it, and the metering of customer end use.<\/p> <p>  The CRU is Ireland's independent energy and water regulator.  Its mission is to protect the public interest in water, energy and energy safety.  The CRU&rsquo;s key functions, delivered under guiding legislation, are: economic regulation of energy, including setting the maximum amount that EirGrid and ESB Networks can invest in network infrastructure and can recover from users in fees; similar economic regulation of water; dealing with customer complaints on energy and water; and energy safety regulation.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee again for inviting myself and my colleagues from the Department and we are happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>I thank our guests and the first committee member who indicated is Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#D00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>Fearaim f&aacute;ilte roimh Dara &Oacute; Maoildhia.

Fibre would be much better.  That is needed now.  <\/p> <p>  The water problem is needed backwards.  It is way overdue because the reality is that every year the State pays a significant amount to boat owners to literally bring water out to the Aran Islands.  It might sound incredible but that is the reality.  <\/p> <p>  The next issue is that the one electric cable to the island has been severed and there is no back-up supply.  I have been proposing this cable be restored and I was wondering if the Department has had discussions with the Department with responsibility for the islands, which would fund the extra costs of the NBI fibre over and above what is already in the project to ensure that the islands have top-of the-range provision.  Obviously, that Department would fund the water pipe or the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications would do so.  <\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the electricity should also be funded by the Department, if necessary.  We did this before and there are precedents for it.  Islands were connected where the Department with responsibility for the islands provided the funding for the connection to the electricity grid between the mainland and the island, and it was then up to the ESB to do so on the mainland and on the island.  Once the Department brought it to the seashore and took it from the seashore on the island, the money was provided.  Has the Department had discussions with the island&rsquo;s division because we are here specifically to focus on that area?<\/p> <p>  The other issue that keeps coming up is where the Department has mentioned solar energy.  Some of the biggest buildings in the country are community buildings.  We are waiting forever and one of the problems with this is that one part is working and the other is not.  However, who is in charge of making sure that all of the parts work together in the State?<\/p><p>We seem to be waiting forever for the guidelines for putting solar panels on community buildings.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question on this and got the same old answer, which is the matter is under consideration and there are aviation concerns about this.  Not everywhere is near an airport.  Will the officials at least say, \"Some areas need further study but here are the guidelines for the remainder of them\"?  That would allow us to get on with it and cut the delays.  As already stated, there is no point having nine tenths of it in place if the final tenth is missing.  A significant amount could be done on the islands, which generally have a better climate than the mainland.  They are actually very good for solar and have very good light.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#D00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I will follow up on that with Mr. Finnegan, if the Chairperson does not mind.

When we looked for the grid connection from the ESB, we were informed that the cable would not take it and could only take 650 kW.

We should clarify.  Importing electricity is as important as exporting electricity to the islands.  The connection is insecure at present and there is no fallback.  Where I live is different in that there are fallbacks.  If power coming from one direction goes, I can get power from another direction, even though I am in a very rural area.  Has Mr. Finnegan discussed this with the Department that has responsibility for the extra cost of extra infrastructure for islands?  They could take a holistic view of water, fibre-optic and electricity and put them in now.  We already have power generation but there is significant usage of electricity on the islands, especially during the summer, and we need to be able to use even more heavy equipment.  In the old days, many people used gas and so on.  We need to replace all the other supplies.<\/p> <p>  There is one other point that is often missed.  You do not need to buy an electric car for use on an island if you wish to use electric vehicles and not use any fossil fuel.  All you have to do is buy a second-hand hybrid because its range is more than adequate for the island if it is charged every night or every three or four nights, depending on the size of the island and the amount of driving you do.  There are only six miles each way on the biggest island.  Would Mr. Finnegan consider going back to the Department with responsibility for the islands and asking it to fork out for the extra cost, and to do it now and put it in place, because the islands are importing as well as exporting.  It is not just for renewable energy.  It is for the people who are there already.

At present, these are dealt with in the same way as everybody else in a sense.  There is a national broadband scheme and a national water utility regulated by the CRU.  ESB Networks and EirGrid are responsible for providing a secure supply of electricity to the islands, as they are everywhere else and, again, they are regulated by CRU in that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made the very interesting suggestion, given the particularities of the islands, that we should liaise with the relevant Department with responsibility for the islands to see if special interventions are needed.

On solar more broadly, as I stated earlier, we are developing a new small-scale generation scheme, which is that middle category between the micro- and larger-scale renewable energy.  We hope that will provide a real opportunity for solar throughout the country, including the islands.  We plan to consult on that in the coming months.  I encourage the island communities to look at that consultation.  We will certainly send it to the Deputy when it comes out.   It is to be hoped that will provide a route to market that does not involve an auction process and some of the complexities that come with that.

The existing electrical cable to the islands covers all the electrical demand on the islands, as it stands.  The Government has said that the entire country will have to move away from fossil fuels in the near future.  As a result, it is more than likely that all the transport and heat on the islands will be electrified.  A significant number of heat pumps have already been installed on the island.  This is increasing all the time.  The electrical demand on the islands will increase as a result.  At present, our 3 MW subsea cable connects us to the mainland.  This is the maximum capacity that can be brought to the island via that cable.  If we continue to electrify all the heat and transport on the islands, our demand is likely to exceed 3 MW.  That cable will not be sufficient for the demand, never mind, as the Deputy said, the export of renewable energy.  It will not be sufficient to supply the islands' demand as we move forward.<\/p> <p>  Ideally, we would like to be able to manage some of that demand locally, produce our own electricity and not rely on importing via the cable, but since we are currently limited to a maximum grid connection of 650 kW, that is not possible either.  It highlights the need to look at the existing cable.  As far as I know, no plans are in place to replace or upgrade that cable.  I have been told by the ESB that it expects the lifetime of the cable to be approximately 60 years and we are about 30 years into that.  In the next ten or 20 years at the very most, that cable will not be sufficient.  It badly needs to be looked at and while we are doing one job of replacing or laying a new cable, it makes sense to look at what else can be done at the same time in order to save on the costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Avril N&iacute; Shearcaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for allowing me to be here.

The important thing to underline about hydrogen is that our focus is on green, renewable hydrogen.  While there is maybe hydrogen of other colours and hues across Europe that is perhaps more advanced, we want to harness our onshore and offshore wind energy, which might otherwise be curtailed or have to be turned down by EirGrid.  There is significant potential for that energy to go into hydrogen production.  The focus has to be on clean and renewable hydrogen.  We published a number of consultations on offshore renewables.

On Deputy Conway-Walsh's point about the Corrib gas field and all the difficulties with the local community, I do not know if a proper study has been carried out in respect of how that could be done differently.  That is what we are interested.  When there is an energy project around our islands, we do not want to be the voice of the opposition.  We want to be the voice of the people who feel that it is our project as well as the Government's project.  It is not that we want to own the project; it is that we want to feel sufficiently engaged with the project in order that we can claim it partly as ours.  In other words, we want to ensure that we are going to get as many of the benefits from this project as are possible for a local community to get.  Obviously, if there are boats going in and out to offshore wind farms, we will need places for the boats to tie up, crews for the boats and particular skills.  All of that could be facilitated for island or coastal communities.  Ros an Mh&iacute;l is obviously going to play a big role.  We want to make sure that develops and is not overlooked.  I do not know if the members appreciate the fact that for the three islands of the Aran Islands, Ros an Mh&iacute;l is like part of our islands.  On Achill, there is a bridge.  Both sides of the bridge are Achill, really.  It is not just the island side of it.  The other side of the bridge is just as much part of it.  There is a hotel there.  It is the same with us.  Ros an Mh&iacute;l is really part of the Aran Islands.  The fishermen who work from Ros an Mh&iacute;l are islanders.  The boat owners and many of the ferry crew members are islanders.  We park our cars on Ros an Mh&iacute;l.  It is part of the Aran Islands.  If Ros an Mh&iacute;l develops, the Aran Islands will also develop and be better from it.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is planning to have a renewable energy park there.

We are flying by the seat of our pants to see how that would work.  It would be great for a study to be done on that which would clarify how not to do it.  We would like to know what was wrong with the Corrib development that it did not engage the community in the proper way and how we can do it properly from here on in with all these major developers. I would love to see a study on that, with proper clear guidelines for the Government as well as for local communities on how to best engage with these big developers.  We are engaging with the Sceirde Rock developers.  We are already in touch with some of the people involved in that.  We are discussing with them how we can facilitate the project.  It is not just about how we can benefit; it how we can facilitate it.  If these developers feel they have the support of coastal and local communities, it is much easier for them to work.

The argument seems to be a little bit like buying a toaster and then coming home to the kitchen and realising that a socket is required.  We know the toaster is coming; we might as well put in the socket.  We know that there is a massive energy opportunity on our western seaboard and our islands.  Let us get the infrastructure in place.  We also know that there is going to be great infrastructure installed.  If we are supporting floating offshore off the west coast, at some stage a great infrastructure will be installed there or we will try to generate hydrogen on-site, in which case we will have a different sort of infrastructure.  We may have a hybrid of the two.  We know what is coming.  There are huge opportunities there.  One of the comments that has been made is that the islanders are dealt with in the same way as anyone else.  This is a recurring theme across this unit of work that we are doing.  We know that the island population is very small, and often fragmented.  The number of special areas of conservation, SACs, that are there jumped out at me.  An SAC in my home town of Tramore would actually be larger in size than all of the islands combined.  This goes across the applications for LEADER funding, social inclusion and community activation programme funding and everything else.  The islands should not be dealt with in the same way as everybody else.  If the islands are dealt with in terms of population, they will never be reached.  We know that there is a cultural value in terms of maintaining our island communities that should be given a priority.<\/p> <p>  I want to dig down into some of the points made by Mr. &Oacute; Maoldhia on the microgrid, in particular.  I am very interested in that.  Of course it is a challenge - it is also a technical challenge - but there are major opportunities.  I am interested in learning a bit more about the features that the co-operative plans to build in.  I am particularly interested in whether the co-operative has looked at the idea of vehicle-to-grid technology.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, one of the things that one does not have to really worry about on islands is range anxiety.  We know that the batteries in electric cars are sufficient to run a household for a reasonably long period.  They have a good deal of storage capacity.  One does not have to worry preserving the battery in the same way as a commuter with a long run ahead of them.  I wonder whether the co-operative has looked at any of those issues.  I know that there are some microgrids, in the Netherlands, for example, that have looked at that vehicle-to-grid technology.  It is a storage solution in respect of renewables, but also a transport solution.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v also referred to the planning exemptions for mid-size projects, specifically the rooftop solar or shed-top solar community projects.  We have also been asking questions on the issue.  We have been told that it is two or three weeks' away for the past I do not know how many months.  It is something that needs to be resolved.<\/p> <p>  The landscape is changing very quickly in terms of the supports that are available, especially for renewables.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Maoldhia to comment on whether he thinks that mid-size generation option is going to answer some of the island needs.  Is it something that the co-operative is looking at?<\/p> <p>  On managing energy behind a transformer, yes we want to export energy, but I am assuming that the co-operative wants to keep most of the energy that is generated on the island as much as possible, or at least for the island to become energy self-sufficient as much as possible.  Does Mr.&Oacute; Maoldhia think we are moving quickly enough in that direction?<\/p> <p>  We are to the cutting edge in respect of green hydrogen.  Perhaps policy has tried to catch up.  I definitely think our ambition is there in terms of green hydrogen.  Mr. Newsome delineated between the different colours of hydrogen.  We are leading, or are close to the forefront, on green hydrogen, blue hydrogen and whatever else.  The other possibility for storing that energy is through fertiliser production at the source of generation.  I am not sure whether that is an avenue that the islands would like be going down. I wonder if it is something that they have looked at and considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#G00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>We might start with the representatives of the Department and then move on to Mr. &Oacute; Maoldhia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#G00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>The Deputy made very good points in respect of the fact that there is a need to co-ordinate and to work together.

Organisationally, they are all the responsibility of one Department and one regulator ultimately.  The structure is there.  The Deputy also made the point very well about why the grid needs to be upgraded.  We are about to buy ourselves as very large toaster, as it were.  I like that image.  Those toasters are being bought everywhere.<\/p><p>There is a need to upgrade everywhere.  <\/p><p> To reassure the Deputy, it is something that our colleagues in EirGrid and ESB Networks are putting an awful lot of effort into.  Just last year, EirGrid completed what it refers to as Shaping Our Electricity Future, which is its plan to meet future needs in a world with 70% renewables.  The Minister sent them right back out in the climate action plan to redo it to meet the 80% target.  It is its expertise and resources it is putting in that will ensure that the grid is upgraded for the island and for everywhere, because the same issues are happening, but probably more starkly and earlier in the islands.  The same issues are happening everywhere and there is a need for much thought and planning now and much physical work and upgrading in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>Just to add to Mr. Finnegan&rsquo;s response, there is a real question on the trade-off between more electricity links back to the mainland and some other alternative uses, such as green hydrogen production.  In a way, at a micro level, that reflects a larger question in terms of, say, how we might use our offshore wind resources, particularly in the Atlantic.  Is it better that they are coupled with electricity interconnection that we can then export back to Europe or does it make sense to co-locate them with electrolysers and produce hydrogen?  In a slightly different way, a question for some of the islands is what are the cost trade-offs between those two?  That is something that may well change quite radically as technologies mature.  Hopefully the cost of producing solar and wind will come down and make the green hydrogen more economical.  That may mean that you kind of look at the options around the cable or producing hydrogen.  Those are some of the questions to be explored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Newsome"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>First, on microgrids, there are two options that we could follow.  The ESB has a project on microgrids and we asked it if it would consider us one of the pilots of that.  That type of microgrid would be owned and administered by the ESB, but it would try to keep the production and use of electricity local to the three Aran Islands.  That is one option for it.  The other is a community-owned microgrid.  We are working on a pilot study of that through an SEAI-funded programmed called Secure.  We have partners involved in that project here in Ireland.  The idea there would be that households that are already producing electricity, like in my house, I have 2 kW of PV in my garden, I have an electric car that has battery storage and I have heat pumps, therefore I could be one of those prosumers who would join this community-owned microgrid and any surplus electricity that I am generating that I cannot use I would sell into our local microgrid.  That microgrid would then make it available to other consumers on the island who are part of the programme.  This pilot project will probably involve around 20 houses.  We have not quite got to that stage yet.  We are already prosumers.  One of the real challenges is to develop the software involved to monitor the generation and usage of energy in every house that is involved in the project and to feed it to where it is needed in a particular house and so on.  There is quite an amount of software development needed to be done for it.  That is the role of one of the companies that we are involved with in this study.<\/p> <p>  On mid-size rooftop solar PV, the challenge is that any rooftop solar PV would have to be used in the building because we do not have any export capacity if we go ahead with this wind turbine.  We will be using all our export capacity simply for the wind turbine.  Among our frustrations are first, that the wind turbine is not as big as we want it to be and we are being limited; and second, if we do erect the turbine and export that energy, we have blocked all the other possibilities for generating.  We have ambitions to generate much more electricity via solar PV.  However, where will it go if we cannot use it ourselves?  We are either going to have to store it in batteries or convert it to hydrogen.  It is quite frustrating for us.  <\/p> <p>  In a way, that sort of paints the general picture of our problem, at least on the Aran Islands and probably on the other islands as well.  We are pushing ahead faster than the Government is catching up.  We are out there trying to get things done that the Government says it wants done, but it has not put the infrastructure in place for us to do it, in terms of exporting energy, hydrogen or quite a number of other things as well.  In the islands in general, and certainly I can speak for the Aran Islands, the population there is so supportive of this energy transition.  We virtually have no opposition.  We experienced opposition to where we originally proposed to put a turbine, but once we find the right place to put the turbine, we will not have that opposition.  <\/p> <p>  The same applies to all of the other things we are trying to do in the islands.  We get huge support.  We had a meeting the other day in the afternoon on a weekday on Inis M&oacute;r to do with PV panels and people wanting to get them on their roofs and 20 people turned up to it.  That is a huge turnout in a small community on a weekday afternoon.  There is huge support for this transition on the islands, which there may not be to the same extent on the mainland.  Also, the islanders are very educated about it, because we have been involved in this now for the past ten years.  They know what they want, they are supportive of it and they have bought into our overall project, which ultimately is to preserve the language, heritage and culture of the islands.  It is to preserve that richness out there and to keep people on the island and give them quality jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara &Oacute; Maoldhia"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in this morning and for their opening statements.  It is very valuable that we have heard the challenges first-hand from Mr. &Oacute; Maoldhia.  It is good that the Department is here at the same to hear them as well.  Again, this is another hearing as part of our work on the islands that shows, as was said, the need for Departments to work together, as well as that need for island-specific and almost island-proofing of Departments' work and policies.  We have seen that as a trend throughout our work.  Mr. &Oacute; Maoldhia just made the point that it is very clear that the islanders want to play their part and are proactive, which is very positive.  It is something that should be supported in every way possible, given the amount of positivity clearly on the islands.  They are proactive and they want to do X, Y and Z.  They want to play their role in relation to climate action and all that we have to do and all that comes with that.<\/p> <p>  Some of the challenges that have been outlined today again show the need for engagement and working together and for Departments coming together.  That fits nicely into the islands policy and this ten-year island policy action plan that is coming for the islands.

This ten-year policy for the islands and the action plan that will come with it are critical.  It is very important that we have that islands plan, but clearly, because it is for the next ten years, the need for climate action, renewable energy and everything that comes with that obviously needs to be front and centre.

Our island communities are in a unique position because of the clean energy for EU islands initiative.  It gives them special status in progressing this transition to a zero-emission sustainable economy and not just in the delivery of electricity and energy but the overall economy.<\/p><p>I outlined that at the start of the meeting.  We need to capitalise on the islands being part of this particular initiative and to facilitate them.  Mr. &Oacute; Maoildhia put it very well in terms of the 3 MW capacity that is on that cable and the limits in the export capacity.  They would be maxed out once this turbine is constructed, which effectively prohibits the local community from engaging in microgeneration in terms of accessing the export tariff because we do not have the grid capacity there.  The difficulty at the moment is, in terms of how the policy is structured across the Department and across various other Departments and the way the regulatory mechanism is structured across government, it would be easier to push water uphill than get the proposal that Deputy &Oacute; Cuiv has put forward implemented.  It requires new leadership from the Department to drive this forward.  There is direct responsibility and competency in respect of electricity and broadband infrastructure within the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  Water comes under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage but the Minister for the  Environment, Climate and Communications has a role in the signing off on all capital expenditure by Irish Water.  The Department has more than a cursory role in investment by Irish Water.  Ownership of this issue must be taken if we are going to deal with the specific bottlenecks that have been highlighted.  It means the Department needs to step up to the mark in that regard.  <\/p><p> This morning Mr. Newsome made the point that the focus of the Department is green energy.  We all agree that is where the focus should be.  At the moment we are spilling between 10% and 12% of all the renewable electricity we produce.  It is being unused because there is not demand for it.  We should prioritise the issue of green hydrogen even to deal with the problems we have at the moment, which will become multiples of that as we go forward to meet our 80% renewables target by 2030.  We cannot achieve that target unless we deal with the volume of renewable electricity that is unused today.  We have seen a very practical example outlined in evidence from the island communities that they are already reaching that maximum threshold.  Electricity generated from any new solar panel that is installed on any of the three Aran Islands that is not used domestically will be spilled.  <\/p><p> If we can solve the problem on the islands and use our islands as a pilot in respect of the bigger challenges that we have on the island as a whole, they will be a micro example of the challenge we have because Ireland is an isolated electricity grid.  We have unique challenges in Ireland.  If we can solve these problems in our island communities then we can replicate those solutions on a larger scale on the island as a whole.  However, a leadership role needs to be taken in this regard.  The first place we need to start is that the Minister, who has the authority, needs to direct EirGrid to provide the capacity in the electricity network to facilitate export onto our island communities.  Unless that direction is issued by the him, it will not happen.  That is the reality in regard to it.  Unless he is prepared to issue that direction to EirGrid then, in ten years we will still be having the same conversation here.  We will still be impeding the potential progress that is on our islands.  We need to give that special unique treatment to the islands as part of the initiative there at EU level.  That provides us with the opportunity to pilot some of these initiatives.  <\/p><p> Mr. Newsome spoke about the work going on with the SEAI as a trusted intermediary and examining microgeneration.  The reality is that these policies are currently being developed in theory and hopefully they will then be applied in practice subsequent to that.  That is how the SEAI is working in this regard.  Unique challenges will arise as these policies are implemented.  Where better to actually apply these in practice than in our island communities?  The difficulty is that what is being designed at the moment is being designed for the island of Ireland, not for our offshore islands.  Mr. &Oacute; Maoildhia put it very well this morning regarding the unique challenges that are there.  The difficulty is whether we are talking about retrofitting grants, or microgeneration or community scale generation.  There are unique barriers to that happening on our islands and unless we are prepared to proactively address those, none of what we are talking about here will happen in our island communities.  <\/p><p> The representatives of the island communities have put the challenges very well in their submission.  We now need to see the Department taking responsibility for using our island communities as individual pilots to crack the unique challenges we have in Ireland in respect of sustainable, green, renewable electricity.  The islands should be used as a pilot that can then be replicated on the mainland.  We need to see, from the Minister down, across our semi-State bodies, a proactive approach to facilitating this happening.  Mr. Newsome might like to comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#H00900","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for those comments.  I have a few points to make in response.  The Chair highlighted the level of renewable electricity that is being spilled, as he put it, or curtailed.  We are acutely aware of that.  It highlights the need particularly to look at other technologies to make use of that, whether that is storage &ndash; and we have talked today about green hydrogen &ndash; but also batteries and other forms of storage to try to address that.  There is moving demand to try and match the supply.  The Chair made the point that the island communities could be test beds for these types of technologies.  There is the clean energy for EU islands initiative.  There are many islands throughout Europe, such as the Spanish islands and Portuguese islands, including the Azores, that are looking at becoming test beds for developing these technologies, renewables and storage.  The points are well-made around how that could be brought forward here.<\/p> <p>  The points on whether it is the export cable or actually looking at own demand and maybe storage are important things to consider in the island context.

In February, the clean export guarantee tariff became available on the transposition into Irish law of Article 21 of the renewable energy directive.  There is now an obligation on suppliers to remunerate micro and small-scale generators for any residual renewable electricity they export to the grid.  The arrangements to be put in place and the regulatory framework required are under way through the CRU.  We expect payments to begin after June.  People with eligible micro and small-scale generators who have registered for an export connection with ESB Networks on the local grid are already accruing the benefit of this export and they will receive payment later in the year.<\/p> <p>  This is the first stage of the enabling framework.  It brings into the marketplace real remuneration that was never there before.  We understand it has bred a little bit of frustration among people who have been early adopters.  We know there are those on the islands also.  They have been producing electricity for their own consumption and by the nature of the profile of the demand they have been exporting to the grid but not receiving remuneration.  This remuneration is now available and will begin not only to pay those people who have already invested but will improve the business case for those considering investment in the future.  The second phase is direct microgeneration support.  The clean export guarantee is not a government support.  It is an obligation under the EU directive and is funded by the suppliers.  There is no requirement for Exchequer or PSO funding for direct supports.<\/p> <p>  The Government is supporting microgeneration.  The first phase of microgeneration support is the domestic grant scheme, which commenced on 16 February.  There are changes to these supports, which were started by the Chair when he was Minister back in 2018.  The scheme has grown from 78 applications at its initiation in 2018 to more than 4,000 last year.  It is growing substantially year on year.  The grant rate levels have been kept the same as those of previous years to encourage uptake.  We have also reduced the barriers to entry to the scheme.  Previously the minimum building energy rating requirement was set at C level.  This has been removed to provide greater access to solar PV in particular for houses with more challenges in energy efficiency.  Houses built until 2020 are eligible for the scheme.  This creates a greater pool of potential applicants for the scheme.  Later this year the SEAI will expand the scheme to non-domestic applicants and small businesses, farms and community buildings with up to 6 kW solar capacity will be able to apply for a grant.  We expect this to commence in July.<\/p> <p>  There is also a clean export premium tariff.  This guarantees a fixed tariff over 15 years for electricity exported to the grid.  Any difference between the market value of the electricity that is exported and the tariff rate will be funded by the PSO.  At present electricity prices are very high and the impact on the PSO in the current period is likely to be limited if not nothing.  Following consultation with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, which is the energy regulator, we expect an implementation plan in the third quarter of this year and the tariff will be in place thereafter.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague, Mr. Newsome, mentioned we recognise there is a need to fill in support in the space between microgeneration and large-scale renewables under the renewable electricity support scheme, and in particular to recognise the difficulties there are with projects in the community category of the renewable energy support scheme.  This is not only a competitive category but it also has a minimum threshold of 500 kW.  Not only must community projects compete with one another but they must start with a relatively large scheme.  In recognising this, the programme for Government is committed to a small-scale generation scheme.  It will look to provide supports of between 50 kW and 500 kW or perhaps 1,000 kW that would not require a competitive auction environment.  It will allow people to start smaller local community projects to build out their expertise and recognise the challenges in the funding required, particularly in small communities, and to provide a different mechanism of remuneration with a guaranteed tariff at a fixed rate to underpin the investment.<\/p> <p>  In parallel with this are the exemptions on planning that have been mentioned.  The Department has been working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the revisions to the exemptions for solar installations, including solar PV.  These exemptions are well drafted at this stage.  They include the provision of exemptions for new building types, including community buildings, educational buildings and apartment buildings which were not there previously.  These exemptions have not been available to date.  They will be available once the regulations are passed.  There have been challenges with the environmental assessment associated with the revision of these exemptions.  Work on the strategic environmental assessment and the appropriate screening, which are the two critical environmental assessments that need to be done, is well under way.  Barring issues coming out of the screening we expect that draft regulations will be published for a four-week consultation in the coming weeks.  They will then need to go through both Houses of the Oireachtas on their way to becoming law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>With regard to the regulations I can say that the shortest element will be the passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.

We receive updates from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage directly so I cannot comment with any certainty on timelines.  We certainly recognise that it has taken longer than was anticipated.  There have been some challenges.

On the timelines and the aviation piece, a particular concern has been raised by the aviation authority regulator on the impact of glint and glare around airports and especially on the flight paths for aircraft coming in to airports and aerodromes.  This includes helicopter pads at hospitals as well.

Yesterday I attended a focus group for the Irish islands run by the clean energy for EU islands initiative.  That focused on identifying the regulatory barriers.  As members can imagine, much of what we are discussing now was also brought up yesterday.  The Department was represented, along with the SEAI, ESB, EirGrid and the islands were represented as well.  One of the things that was brought up was the lack of progress on the interdepartmental committee for the islands, which I think was established in 2019.  It was certainly under consultation then and perhaps because of the pandemic it did not progress any further than that.  It is clear today there is a dire need for an interdepartmental committee for the islands, not just to deal with energy but all sorts of island needs and departmental areas as well.  A core area of that consultation was around stakeholder engagement and engaging directly with island communities because some Departments, while they may have the best of intentions, can inadvertently overlook island communities.  It is no good for Departments to be overlooking island communities interdepartmentally.  There is a real need for stakeholder consultation and discussing matters with island groups to see what does and does not work because we are most aware of the challenges we face.<\/p> <p>  Aside from that, on the subject of green hydrogen production and utilisation we are currently involved in two European-funded research projects on that.  Both come to an end this year.  One of them is looking specifically at a case study for the ferry companies and we are looking at Galway Port.  There is also a project under way in Galway port to develop a green hydrogen hub.  As far as I am aware, it estimates it can produce up to 1,800 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum.  This would be a huge boost and it is all looking at using curtailed electricity from the nearby wind farms in County Galway.<\/p> <p>  Outside that, the EU has highlighted islands through its clean energy for EU islands initiative, which we are all familiar with.  Other countries around Europe have made specific funding available to their island groups that is not available to other communities.  They have done this to support and enhance the ability of island communities to achieve their goals around the energy transitions.  The Government can make similar funds available to island communities to address the challenges that are specific to us.  I am aware there may be financing and regulatory issues but if other countries have been able to make funds available specifically for islands then I do not see why our Government could not do the same around the energy transition.<\/p> <p>  I submitted a response to a consultation by ESB Networks last year at the end of December.  That consultation was under its piloting roadmap as part of the national network, local connections consultation.  My submission outlined our existing assets on the island.  At the moment we have about 300 kW of air-to-water heat pumps, 150 kW of PV, 185 kWh of battery storage and as Mr. &Oacute; Maoile&aacute;in outlined earlier we have about 20 electric vehicles on the islands as well.  All of these assets will allow us to, for want of a better phrase, flatten the curve of our energy demand and generation.  In order to balance the grid there needs to be added flexibility, as I am sure members are aware, and these assets in such as small island grid would be the perfect opportunity to test the different technologies required.  As the Chairman outlined earlier it could then be scaled up and replicated across the country.  This was also reiterated at a workshop we organised in 2018 by SEAI but so far we have not seen any further development on that.  The Government, if it wished, would be able to provide additional supports and a real focus on our islands to get us over the line.  There is much great sentiment going around but unfortunately we are finding a lot of the roll-out of those supports is very slow.<\/p> <p>  One example of those is the SEAI community-enabling framework.  The Chairman is correct that we have engaged with that programme and we have found it be very beneficial but it does not go far enough for projects or communities that are at the stage we currently are.  We were issued our grid assessment in February, which means we have two years to get planning permission for our project, that is, our community turbine on Inis Me&aacute;in.  If we do not have the planning permission by that time the grid capacity is released again and it may well be gone by the time we come back around with our planning permission.  I do not believe two years is a realistic timeframe for any wind project in the country to get planning permission and certainly not one that is being community led.  This is purely because as we do not have the expertise or the deep pockets developers have, things move at a much slower pace and there is very little that can be done to help that.  For solar projects, two years may be feasible but in my opinion that limit is setting communities up to fail because I do not see how it is going to be achievable and certainly not on islands.  For example, we could very well need to do a two-year bird study that straight away means we could not possibly have planning permission within a two-year period.<\/p> <p>  I believe the SEAI is in the process of rolling out and approving their financial supports for communities to finance the pre-development costs of generation projects.  This is what we need at the moment.  Our project and others that were successful in enduring connection policy, ECP 2.1 are now looking for funding for feasibility studies, bird studies, route surveys and all the rest that goes into your planning application.  However, that financing simply is not there.  We are being weighed down making LEADER applications and some very slow and onerous applications and waiting for decisions, all while the clock is ticking on that two-year period.  While I appreciate the SEAI's supports are coming and understand they should be covering up to 80%, when I hear of the pre-development costs those supports simply are not there in time.  It means communities that have gone without the support up to now are likely to not have it in time to meet their goals.  I am wondering if there is any indication of exactly when those supports will be rolled out, in order to fund the pre-development costs of these projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Avril N&iacute; Shearcaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1061,"content":"<p>I call Senator Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#L00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I have a few brief questions for Mr. Somers.

Is there any chance the tariff could be increased?  In view of the costs suppliers are charging, I think it should be.  There is also some concern regarding people who are putting in solar panels and a battery pack.  Some people are told that they do not need a battery if they have a smart meter.  Others are being told they need the battery to be able to manage things better.  There is a bit of ambiguity in that regard.<\/p><p> Will the Department clarify whether applications to export electricity are made through the SEAI or some other body?  Is there a separate application?  Do people have to do it themselves or do the people who put in the solar panels do it on their behalf?<\/p><p> Deep retrofits do not suit everybody.  There are very few people who have the funds to go to the level of a deep retrofit.  People know their own houses better than anyone else, including the person who comes out to do the BER certificate.  They know where the drafts and so on are.  There should be an option to retrofit on a piecemeal basis and to install solar panels, roof insulation and wall insulation in stages with grants paid at the same level as that paid in respect of a deep retrofit.  In that way, people could reach the same standard as they would reach through a deep retrofit over a number of years but would be able to manage their own financial resources over that period of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#L00500","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>Mr. Somers might come back in on the questions from Senator Burke.

The CRU which is the energy regulator, has decided that the suppliers should set the tariffs on a competitive basis and compete for that business from micro and small-scale generators.  These tariffs should be related to \"the market value of that electricity\".  That is the language included in the directive that was transposed into Irish law.  What that really means is that the tariffs should be reflective of the wholesale value of the electricity.  Those tariffs are set by the supplier.  We know that at least one supplier has advertised a tariff on its website that is in excess of 10 cent per kWh.  There is talk of another supplier going even higher.  We have yet to see some of the largest players come into the market with their tariffs.  Those tariff levels and quantities that I am referring to are particular to the wholesale market and, as we know, energy prices are very high at the moment.  To set people's expectations, I will note that they may not always be that high.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referenced what people are paying for electricity.  He will have heard it said that, in the first instance, solar PV should be installed for the purpose of one's own consumption.  If you are consuming the renewable energy you are generating yourself, the saving you make offsets the cost of electricity you are buying from your energy supplier.  The value of that electricity is a lot higher than the clean guarantee tariff for any energy you export to the grid.  That means that it is clearly of optimum benefit to people with renewable generation capacity to consume the maximum possible proportion of the electricity they generate and to export only the smallest amount of residual energy because it will always be of less value when exported to the grid.<\/p> <p>  With regard to solar panels and batteries, perhaps what the Senator is referring to is that, in the pilot microgeneration support scheme for domestic solar PV, there was a requirement to meet a minimum building energy rating, BER, of C.  That meant that people had to choose whether to take energy efficiency measures to meet that standard at the time they were planning to install solar PV.  With regard to the ability to take a single measure rather than multiple measures, that has been addressed in the new microgeneration support scheme.  The requirement to have a minimum BER rating has been removed for domestic applicants so you can do solar PV as a single measure and be free to take energy efficiency measures at a later date.  However, the most benefit and the quickest payback on any investment in retrofitting a home will always come from energy efficiency measures.  The energy you do not use is the most valuable energy.  Reducing your energy consumption is of more benefit to you than producing solar-generated electricity.<\/p> <p>  On another point relating to batteries and whether there is a need to install batteries, there is no absolute need to install batteries but they can help you to manage the profile of electricity produced during daylight hours and the consumption of electricity in the daytime and early evening, when there is no generation happening.  That can increase your self-consumption and, as I mentioned earlier, increasing self-consumption is the best way to get payback on your investment.  Battery costs are high, however.  In the work we did in assessing eligibility, costs and the requirements of the microgeneration support scheme and the grants in particular, we recognised that battery costs are still very high relative to investment in solar.  We therefore do not require people to install a battery to avail of the grant support.  Previously, if you were looking for grant support above 2 kW, you had to install a battery to avail of the additional grant moneys available for installations of up to 4 kW.  That requirement has been removed.  However, in parallel with that, the direct support for batteries has been removed.  This means that the overall investment can be lower for people.  <\/p> <p>  This is being done at a time when, in parallel with that decision, the clean export guarantee tariff is in place, so people can use that residual electricity and be remunerated by their supplier for exporting it to the grid.  We believe that we will keep that relationship between grant values and the requirements around battery supports under review on an ongoing basis because, in the same vein as solar panel costs having come down substantially, by up to 70% or 80%, over the past ten years, battery costs are on a similar trajectory.  However, it is too early yet to mandate battery installation.  <\/p> <p>  The last thing I will say about batteries is that, at the time when decisions on the development of the microgeneration policy were taken, we did not have the energy crisis we have today causing energy security to come to the fore.  One of the key features that we will keep under review is the role of batteries in improving overall energy security.<\/p> <p>  In terms of applications for export connections, domestic and small-scale users will typically connect to the distribution grid, as a result of which their applications go to ESB Networks.  A solar installer will commonly make that application on behalf of the grant applicant.  Approved installers registered with the SEAI are very familiar with the process and understand the requirement to register for export.  However, the application can also be made by the householder.  There is a lot of information on microgeneration available on ESB Networks' website and on our Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022033000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Somers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>I will briefly respond to Ms N&iacute; Shearcaigh's question on the community enabling framework for RESS.  To set this out for committee members, there are a number of elements to the community enabling framework, which need to be thought of as a whole.

All of those should work together to support community projects through the various project phases from feasibility through the early and middle stages and on to the operational stage of the project and the meeting of the various milestones.<\/p><p> We had the trusted advisory enabling framework done by quarter 1 and beat our climate action deadline.  I am very confident that will come before very shortly in quarter 2.  I cannot give a precise date but it is coming very shortly.  The SEAI will announce it and it is pretty ready to go.  Once that is rolled out then it should provide strong supports to community projects to get them through various stages.  There are other aspects.

I have a prepared statement, which I will read.  I am joined by three colleagues.  We will be more than happy to take any questions members may have following my presentation.<\/p><p>I stress that there are limitations to what I can say for reasons of national security and the security and privilege of our clients.  Let me start with the cybersecurity implications of Russia&rsquo;s ongoing invasion of Ukraine both in general and for Ireland.  Ukraine has been victim of a series of cyberattacks over the last decade and has been in many ways patient zero for the more serious and sometimes destructive attacks and incidents we have heard so much about.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, it is clear that the Russian state possesses and is willing to use very advanced offensive cybersecurity capabilities, and has sought to deploy at least some of these in the run-up to and during its most recent invasion of Ukrainian territory.  However, at least as far as can be determined, the effect on target of these has been minimal so far.  The precise reasons for this may not be known for some time.  However, it appears that a combination of Ukrainian preparedness and targeted assistance from elsewhere has helped reduce the effectiveness of cyber tools in this case, rendering them a less effective complement to conventional weapons.<br\/><br\/>There are of course manifold implications for national and international security flowing from the war on Ukraine by Russia, including the creation of profound uncertainty about the immediate future.  On that basis, threat levels and risks may change, rapidly and seriously.  However, at present, the NCSC&rsquo;s assessment of the risks to this State - in general and not just limited to Russian activity in Europe - is as follows.  The threat from cybercrime against the State, including Government and private sector, continues to be high, particularly from ransomware.  We have not seen any change to the rate or seriousness of these types of incidents since the onset of the war and expect to continue to see attempts to extort money from entities here.<br\/><br\/>The threat from destructive cyberattacks conducted directly against the State or entities here continues to be low.  The NCSC has not observed any evidence to suggest that there has been significant preparatory work under way.  However, there have been some reports of increased scanning activity both in Ireland and across the European Union and US.  The NCSC assessment is that there is no evident intent by any party to launch attacks against the State.  Similarly, there is no evidence of this type of activity being launched against other EU states either.  However, the NCSC assessment is that the risks of an incident affecting a service operating at a European or global scale, and of a second or third order effect on services here is moderate.<br\/><br\/>The threat from cyber activism against Ireland continues to be low.  There has been a very pronounced increase in this type of activity in Russia and Ukraine, but there is little evidence of this type of activity outside of this limited environment.<br\/><br\/>The threat from cyberespionage against the public and private sector in Ireland continues to be high.  The NCSC assesses that the State continues to face a persistent, active and serious threat of cyberespionage against both public and private entities, and that this risk remains unaffected by events in eastern Europe.  I stress again that this assessment and analysis may change, and change quickly.<br\/><br\/>The NCSC has been operating at a heightened state of preparedness since late last year in response to the tensions in eastern Europe and ongoing discussions at a European and international level on cybersecurity risks.  We have contingency plans in place, in case of escalation of malicious cyberactivity impacting networks and services here.  We are working with sectoral regulators and Departments to further develop these plans in key areas.  We have arrangements in place to avail of external expert support, as required, including a number of third-party incident-response services which can be immediately made available to support Government or critical national infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>We have also issued a number of guidance and support documents, including most pertinently our NCSC Cyber Vitals Checklist on 1 February and a detailed advisory note on 17 February.  This advisory detailed a risk assessment and appropriate advice regarding the ongoing situation in Ukraine.  These documents and much more are publicly available on our website <i>ncsc.gov.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We are in ongoing contact with our counterparts across the European Union, as well as the UK, US and other countries to share information and monitor possible threats.  We continue to work closely with the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are in frequent contact with operators of critical infrastructure and services to monitor for possible malicious cyberactivity.<br\/><br\/>The message to organisations and operators at this time is very simple: we urge everyone to take the time to ensure that their cybersecurity risk assessments are updated and that their mitigating measures and response plans match the current situation.  The NCSC Cyber Vitals Checklist remains a simple effective place to start for entities of any scale.<br\/><br\/>As members know, the NCSC is undergoing a period of expansion and development as a result of the Government decision in July 2021 to implement the recommendations of a capacity review which was initiated in the previous year.  Since then, we have taken significant steps to expand the resources and capabilities of the organisation.  We are in the process of filling 20 new permanent posts, most of which are at a senior level and the fit-out of a temporary facility for the NCSC is in progress with a view to occupation before midyear.<br\/><br\/>In addition to implementing the recommendations of the capacity review we continue to work on the measures set out in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2019-2024 with a number of measures fully achieved or at an advanced stage.  This year we will carry out a midpoint review of the strategy to reassess priorities and incorporate developments and lessons learned since its inception.  One critical area to be addressed as part of this review is the ongoing negotiations for a revised network and information security, NIS, directive, which supersedes some aspects of the 2019 strategy.  The revised directive, NIS2, is expected to cover a broader range of sectors within a more stringent compliance framework.  It is currently the subject of EU Council trilogue negotiations.  It is in the latter stages of negotiations.<br\/><br\/>In the interests of time, I will skip briefly through our future planning.  The NCSC headcount will grow to 45 at least by year-end and to 70 by 2024.  The Government has committed to bringing forth a general scheme of a Bill to increase the powers of the NCSC by providing the legal authority to properly conduct monitoring and to gather and store intelligence on cyberthreats relating to national security.<br\/><br\/>The capacity review also recommended that the NCSC cease its compliance role under the NIS directive as it detracts from our core mission to defend cyberspace and act as trusted adviser to critical infrastructure.  We are reviewing the options for devolving these functions to existing sectoral regulators in advance of the introduction of NIS2.<br\/><br\/>I remind the committee and interested parties that our website, <i>ncsc.gov.ie<\/i>, and our Twitter feed remain valuable and up-to-date sources for information on cybersecurity risks and threats.

Obviously, to set up the kind of facility the NCSC needs requires considerable technology and expense.  What does he mean by temporary?  Will the NCSC be moving on to somewhere else?  He mentioned the plan to increase to 45 personnel by the end of the year.  Is that achievable?  Obviously, it is necessary, but can it be done?  He mentioned the capacity review involving devolving the compliance role to existing regulators.  What regulators is he referring to?<\/p> <p>  There is a significant increase in the number of fake messages people receive.  The public are alarmed at the expanding range of scams and the financial extortion involved in them.  Is the NCSC taking mobile communications under its cyber remit?<\/p> <p>  Since the HSE network was hit, there has obviously been an increased awareness of the possibility of cyberattacks.  Industry is taking it very seriously.<\/p><p>The HSE has spent millions of euro redressing the problem.  Remediation of this type of damage is extremely costly.  Several companies have advised me that they have moved to insure themselves against attack and the cost of an attack.  They have been told the insurance companies are refusing to include cyberattacks on their policies.  Insurance companies are saying that they treat cyberattacks as acts of war, which is similar to a clause that is used in the case of flooding, which they say is an act of God.  This is obviously going to become a serious issue if it is not addressed.  What is Dr. Browne&rsquo;s feedback in that regard, and what is his view on insurance cover? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#F00300","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>There are quite a few questions, some I will address in more detail and others very quickly.  Taking the staffing and skill sets questions together, first of all I think having 45 staff members is achievable and with a tail wind we will go beyond 45 this year.  We do not have a limitation in regard to resourcing.  The limitation is finding people as fast as we can.<\/p> <p>  When I say &ldquo;advanced stage&rdquo;, it means we are interviewing at the moment.  I am obviously limited in what I can say about that but I am interviewing on Friday and on Monday and multiple times throughout April.  It will likely be into June by the time we start to see numbers arriving in force.  At that point quite a few people will arrive.  We had four separate competitions open, and closed.  The closing date has passed.  We are in the interviewing process for four separate competitions.  There are two more to launch.  That is the situation we are in.  Four of six are well under way.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to skill sets &ndash; this is an important point &ndash; it is important to note that we have a very advanced cybersecurity industry here by dint of the fact that we have a large technology sector, which has brought its own cybersecurity services.  That has led to the creation of significant offices here working in very advanced cybersecurity fields.  It is a huge bonus for us because we have direct access to companies here doing leading-edge cybersecurity research and providing leading-edge global services and skills.  It also means of course that there is huge competition for those skill sets.  That is a challenge.<\/p> <p>  The NCSC has focused in particular on incident response and forensics.  Historically our primary role has been incident response.  Over the next few years the committee will see it become much more diverse in terms of its functions because of European legislation and other things we know we should be doing.  We are strong on incident response.  We have a significant and deep skill set.  The challenge may arise in those other areas as we go on.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to its new strategy, a number of individual programmes are under way via Skillnet, the universities themselves and the universities working with industry to create new masters and degree level programmes, as well as diploma programmes in cybersecurity, but this is still a relatively young industry in that context.  The supply chain of talent is becoming an issue globally.  We are not unique in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As for facilities, we have secured a long-term facility.  Our permanent facility will be in Dublin 4.  It will be built to the full NATO security specification.  As that process is also under way, our temporary facility only has to do us from mid-year this year until towards the end of next year.  It is a relatively short-term facility.  That does not mean it cannot be secure.  It is being secured to a very high level.  Of course that will be left to somebody else as a secure facility after we leave.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the compliance role I will not go into detail on the types of regulators but as a general point of principle, in most European countries the NIS compliance functions were devolved out at the outset.  For example, the telecoms regulator &ndash; and we will talk about nuisance calls in a moment &ndash; took telecoms security as part of its general remit.  The energy regulator did the same and so on.  That is the general pattern we expect to see happen here.  On the nuisance calls issue, this is a good example of why that has been the case.  Telecoms is a matter for the telecoms regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, and it has a particular role.  It has a series of measures in place including a new nuisance calls committee, which is bringing together An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, people from the NCSC and people from across the telecoms sector to drive a series of measures.  We have already taken some measures with it on particular types of nuisance calls, that is, those involving hyperlinks or Internet-facing services essentially.  We are seeking to exploit that dichotomy where we make the telecoms and other regulators more directly responsible for regulating their industries and we deal with incident response and the higher level technological challenges.  <\/p> <p>  Lastly, there are two things.  The HSE incident is resolved.  It was an extremely serious criminal incident which affected not just the HSE but also the medical staff, patients and the families of patients on a national level for several weeks.  This is an extremely serious example of what can go wrong in a ransomware incident.  It was, as is nearly always the case, a preventable incident.  It could have been prevented, which is the really material challenge from our perspective.  In terms of the lessons learned, the HSE took the brave and proper approach late last year of publishing a detailed analysis by PwC as to what exactly happened and what went wrong.  That provides a very useful baseline for the HSE going forward.  We continue to work it as recently as this morning on the steps it should be taking to move that along. <\/p> <p>  The insurance issue is relatively new.  I am not familiar with this act of war concept.  Clearly under international law, cyberattack can be an act of war but usually for an insurance company or a commercial contract to reflect that, it would have to be declared as such by a state.  That is something we might pursue offline, if the Chairman does not mind.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Richard Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>I am on the rota to speak next.

The national security issues around this are embedded in more normal corporate governance kind of issues.  I will explain how we do what we do.  Then I will cover the other points.  The NCSC deals with cybersecurity, that is to say, the resilience and protection of critical infrastructure, national incident response and national incident response co-ordination.  Increasingly, there are issues on setting standards for issues such as 5G telecoms and other related issues.  That is our role.  The Garda has two roles in this regard, one of which is investigating and prosecuting cybercrime.  That is one issue and it is related to a series of fraud and economic crime activities.  Second, it also has a domestic national security role.  We deal with it on both of those.  The Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, the defence establishment, obviously have the defence of the State against acts of armed aggression from the Defence Acts but they also have a cyberdefence role in terms of protecting their own networks against attacks from whatever in the cyber domain.  That is how the roles generally pan out.<\/p> <p>  How we interact is on a number of different levels.  On an operational level in terms of incident response we work closely with all of the uniformed agencies as well as, from time to time, the Data Protection Commission.

One is on the incidents we are seeing or that are being reported in the media and the second is on our assessment of the links between organised crime in Russia and the Russian state.<\/p> <p>  On the first, it is very important to note that there has been a very considerable amount of attention on cybersecurity in many different companies, entities and Departments for a long time.  Most of that has been very helpful and from time to time that spills over into paranoia, which is a function of what we do.  One finds that issues are being reported as major incidents when in fact they may be nothing.  That is just accidents and these things happen.  It is useful to have a balanced perspective as to the risks here and not to be calling everything a wolf because the day will come when you have a wolf, and then no one will believe you.  <\/p> <p>  Second, there is the much more vexed question on the links between Russian organised crime and the Russian state.  The honest answer, and it will be the same answer from many European governments and many private cybersecurity firms, is that no one has been able to pin a direct link there in any material sense.  There are many rumours and much supposition and there is a fairly obvious question as to how could they not know, but there has been very little by way of firm links proven by anybody between the Russian state and individual threat actor groups.  It is, of course, entirely possible that this might be some kind of symbiotic relationship but right now, and on paper, there is no material proof of that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Richard Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>The national security analysis centre is a co-ordination of the NCSC, the Defence Forces, the Garda and that whole bit that relates to national security.

Can I have a picture of the hierarchy and the very specific details, because I do not believe it makes a great deal of sense that we have not been able to get somebody to appear before the committee from the Defence Forces or whatever?

We work closely with the Communications and Information Services, CIS, Corps which is the part of the Defence Forces that does this and they have a security incident response team, SIRT, of their own.  They are equipped and trained to deal with that.  In some ways they operate like any other constituent of the NCSC because we give them threat intelligence information and provide them with guidance and, like the Oireachtas or any other entity, that is their role.  Clearly, the Defence Forces have a broader set of roles also but obviously some of those roles are in a space that is not usually discussed, or ever discussed, in public which, of course, also poses limitations for us to talk about them.<\/p> <p>  On a hierarchy, we all have our roles.  The hierarchy is flat in that the Government has sovereignty and that is the way it has to work.  There is obviously a question as to why cyber is being dealt with in a separate organisation and we have military, law enforcement and national security functions in both, and yet we have an entirely separate National Cyber Security Centre.  That is entirely normal in a European context.  Everybody, including in the US, have exactly the same thing.  There is a civilian resilience response information provision body.  It is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, in the US and it is the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, in the UK, and so on, and \"NCSC\" is, in fact, a term used in most of Europe.  <\/p> <p>  The term I tend to use is that cybersecurity is a confounding policy problem.  It is in everything and everything is in it.  Everybody carries around a computing device in his or her pocket and some of us carry more than one.  These devices are privately owned, the networks that serve them are privately owned, the technology they run on is privately owned and yet they can be the subject of a national security incident and, in fact, anybody in this room could be the subject of one immediately.  One ends up with organisations like ours that have this cross-cutting and sometimes confusing set of remits but which remain utterly essential.  As we look at this, and we have been in the context of our legislation, this model is not waning.  The model of an NCSC as a separate civilian organisation is, if anything, becoming more robust.  Sweden and others are moving more in this direction also.

They had set up shell-type companies or whatever in this State in order to get that level of expert technical software or whatever it was that was required.  We are all aware of the diplomatic footprint that Russia has here and that there were diplomats-operatives who were given their marching orders in recent times.  Could Dr. Browne give us, in as much as is possible, a certain outline to that threat we are under?  We all know that this State is almost a tax superpower, to a degree.

That means that there is a significant amount of IP, or intellectual property here which is a very significant target for threat actors from around the world and not just any individual state.  There is obviously a significant amount of interest in that.<\/p> <p>  Second, it is important to note that this is a relatively wealthy country, an EU member, has a full seat on the UN Security Council for the moment, and is heavily engaged in a large number of international organisations: public, private, civic, private sector, and so on.

If they become aware of an issue, they need to have somewhere to turn to for expert advice and guidance.  One of our roles in this regard is to understand exactly what is happening and, in some cases, to predict what will happen.

The NCSC has been changed from a reporting to an independent office.  Does Dr. Browne believe he has the full independence he requires as the director of the National Cyber Security Centre?<\/p> <p>  I am disappointed that the staff numbers will be hitting approximately 70.  I would have hoped it would have a team of a couple of hundred at least.  NCSC staff should be operating in every Department and every semi-State organisation, reporting directly to Dr. Browne and not to the Department.  We all know that when something goes wrong, the tendency is to close the hatches and keep it in house, rather than allowing it out.  I would be interested in his views on that.  As Dr. Browne pointed out in his presentation, we are lucky that the major IT companies based in this country have their own inbuilt cybersecurity teams, because if they did not, some of them might be reconsidering their position with respect to staying in the country.<\/p> <p>  I would be anxious to see Dr. Browne at the top of a pyramid, but I would want to see him with assistant directors looking after, for example, integration with the private sector.  Clearly from what he has said today, if we have a major cyberattack, the NCSC can only oversee other organisations working for it to resolve the problems.  I would like to see the NCSC with a director with responsibility for the private sector.  The NCSC should have very deep relationships with academia.  I would like the NCSC to be in a position where it could fund research.  I am not sure what funds are available to it to do that.<\/p> <p>  I believe the Defence Forces had two seats within the NCSC organisation, but they have not been filled for a number of years as far as I am aware.  Dr. Browne might let me know what the situation is in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Browne may not want to deal with this, but I will ask it anyway.  A number of organisations in the country are involved in gathering intelligence, including the Defence Forces, the Garda, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice.  Notwithstanding that we have a national security analysis centre, we do not have a director of homeland security.  We do not have somebody who is at the top of the intelligence heap.  My personal view is that Dr. Browne is the person who should be co-ordinating all intelligence in the country.  It should all be coming into the NCSC because cyber is the new war.  Defence in the country in concentrated in the three elements of land, sea and air and we are only beginning to wake up to the fourth element which is cyber.<\/p> <p>  I wish Dr. Browne well in his appointment.  This committee fought hard to get that job recognised properly and I commend the Chairman on his work.  Does Dr. Browne have enough power?  Does he need more?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#K00500","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>There is a lot in that.  The Senator and I have many areas of agreement.  There are two elements to the question of power, authority and independence.  Because we have a national security function, independence is something that will never happen for the NCSC.  That is a good thing.  We are subject to the political system and all the governance and control that come with that.  That said, the Senator's last point makes it very clearly; the elevation of the level of the director of the NCSC indicates the importance it is being given across Government, not just in the Department but at a whole-of-system level.  It also fully reflects the focus on this across this security system in the state.  As the Senator will be aware, there are five domains of warfare, including space.  How we manage the fusion of intelligence sources around all that is somewhat in flux.  Work on a national security strategy has been in process for a while but it is essentially complete.  It addresses many of these questions.  As it has not been agreed, obviously, I cannot go into it in any detail.<br\/><br\/>There are two further questions that are particularly interesting to deal with upfront.  The Senator asked how many staff we ultimately need.  The figure of 70 is a start, but I agree we will need to go significantly beyond that.  The facility we are building in Dublin 4 has space for many more than that.  That should be a general guide.  I do not think anybody has accused me of lacking ambition in this regard.<br\/><br\/>The Senator asked about our role in having staff sitting in other organisations.  We do not have secondments out of the organisation simply because we are keeping the staff for what they fundamentally need to do right now.  The NCSC needs to grow and in due course we will be in a position to have secondees elsewhere.  We need to keep two things in mind in that regard.  First, we have a sensor platform deployed across Departments.  We do not need to have someone in the office because we are watching externally from a distance.  Second, we have a rapid-reaction team that can be sent into offices if we have an incident.  We use that on a relatively regular basis, most pertinently in the Coombe incident before Christmas, which was a public incident.<br\/><br\/>Do we have sufficient power under the legislation?  No, we do not.  There are things we need to do that we cannot do at present.  We are limited not by our technology or by our people in some ways, but by our statutory powers.  That is in process and work is significantly advanced on all that.  I am sure the committee will be engaged in that process when the legislation comes before it.  Some of that will clarify our role <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other organisations in the State.  Some of it will create new powers which have not previously been in anybody's hands in the State.  I am sure it will be challenging for people to understand why.  That is a process we will get to in due course.<br\/><br\/>Regarding research, we work very closely through Cyber Ireland with academia and bilaterally with academia on the skills piece.  Much more remains to be done there.  Regarding research, the Senator should watch this space; we hope to make a public announcement quite soon.  I agree there is a question.  It is covered in measures 14 and 16 of the national cybersecurity strategy around how we fund and structure cybersecurity research in the State.  We do not have a singular hub of expertise.  We have a number of university departments with significant expertise and universities with a background in this space, but no singular hub.  That is something we feel needs to be addressed and it is covered in the strategy.  That is also in process at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Richard Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I am on record as saying we should be proactively probing organisations.<\/p><p>If an organisation is found to have a gap in its security system, the centre should be able to issue a warning and give it a period of time to resolve the possible gap, and if it fails to do that, it should be forcibly removed from the network and denied access to the worldwide web.<\/p><p> Another matter that is a major concern for me is the undersea cables coming to Ireland.  We know that a cable was cut in Finland recently.

We have powers roughly akin to those suggested by the Senator, including the ability to audit.  We have an ongoing compliance process.  It does not amount to a full audit, but when we are either uncomfortable with the level of preparedness or we are just doing a circular, it-is-that-time type of audit, we do audits of critical infrastructure operators.  Those have found gaps in the past, which we have compelled them to fix and redress.  That is a very detailed and complex process for a number of different reasons.  In our view, it is much better served if it is mainlined as part of the general regulatory work of the organisation because quite often in regulated sectors funding is provided via regulatory decision and if a regulatory decision is that one must spend more on cybersecurity, that should come via the funding authority.  That is somewhat self-evident.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of physical infrastructure, first, we do not have a role in physical infrastructure.  In some of our incident response processes and some of our compliance work, we specify some physical controls that have to be in place.  The first thing the committee should always keep in mind on this is that the most pressing threat to fibre infrastructure is always the big yellow digger, BYD, type.  The most likely prospect is that somebody will hit it with a digger.  The most likely prospect for subsea cables is that somebody will pull an anchor or a trawl over it.  In some cases, fibres are armoured and protected against it, but not always.  The physical infrastructure is complex, and the Commission on the Defence Forces report makes some recommendations relating to this which will be addressed in due course in a piece.  We have spoken to our colleagues in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, in the US about this in the recent past and they have outlined what they do.

Every country and every entity with an Internet connection is vulnerable to some type of incident.  Cybersecurity incidents are uniquely complex because of the nested nature of systems.  This organisation, every organisation and every individual depend on a networked series of services.  It is impossible in some ways to predict what will happen if entity X, Y or Z is affected.  It is not just whether we are vulnerable, but understanding the detailed, nested set of dependencies in that vulnerability.  We have completed, and it is in the strategy, our most recent risk assessment of critical infrastructure.  We have a fairly detailed understanding - I will not say it is 100% comprehensive - of the primary nest of dependencies.<\/p> <p>  We are lucky in some ways.  This is a small State.  We have a relatively resilient infrastructure and we have a relatively limited number of touch points, but there will always be challenges.  Our role has been to prepare the critical services.  We have started with critical, but we will go beyond that in due course to make sure that as many people as possible are aware of and up to speed on this.  We face a challenge.  To be blunt about it, we have lived for a long time with a benign external security environment.  Cybersecurity and the rise and development of these types of cross-cutting, deeply-enmeshed threats pose a new challenge for this State, which we are dealing with without some of the institutional architecture that other states have had in the past.  That means we have to invent things and systems as we go.

That is backed into sectoral-specific legislation, and banking and financial services are an obvious case in point.  Also, in telecommunications, for example, they have 2011 obligations on network and information security, which means they were slightly further ahead.  The mentality question is difficult to answer because there is no single unified organisational culture across these organisations.  They are very different.  The HSE faces huge challenges in balancing a large clinical workload and the care responsibilities for 5 million people with cybersecurity responsibilities that come in on top of all that late in the day, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  I do not think it is fair to say there is a singular mentality of any kind.  There is a broad and much more focused understanding of the risks associated with cybersecurity incidents, not just since the HSE incident but going back years prior to that.  There is a growing collective understanding of the things that need to be done to deal with that.  The challenge is that some of these changes are structural.  They are not just the need to buy better computers, but a structural change to organisations, which takes time.  That is happening across the public service, particularly thanks to the work of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, the national digital strategy and a much greater focus on unified digital processes.<\/p><p>Across the private sector, some areas are going to struggle, and were always likely to, especially in the voluntary sector.  In some cases, such sectors handle personal data, personal information and relatively large amounts of money but may not have strong corporate governance around their function.  If members look at our recent baseline standard for the public sector, to our mind this needs to be a governance question and needs to be mainlined as part of corporate governance.  When we speak about regulators taking on and mainstreaming cybersecurity as part of their regulatory function, the same argument needs to be made in corporate governance more generally.  Work is ongoing with the chartered accountants' organisations to look at exactly that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#L01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Richard Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1166,"content":"<p>The NCSC referenced in its presentation that its headcount will grow from 45 to 70 by 2024.

The NCSC is fully engaged with that organisation and has been since its origins.  It is also important to know that Cyber Ireland was centrally involved in helping us draft the national cybersecurity strategy.  Some of the measures came from that process and from the group that makes up the board of that organisation.  Cyber Ireland has a very important role to play in all this.  It operates as a cluster and focal point for industry, the Government, the private sector and the third level sector in general.  It has already had significant success in bringing these organisations together.  The cluster membership alone is extremely comprehensive in terms of the industry in the State.  It is bringing out a very substantial publication in the next couple of weeks, which will explain a lot of this in much greater detail.<\/p> <p>  I tacitly referred to this in my responses to Senator Craughwell, but it is important to note there is a European national co-ordination centre, NCC, role for research and development which includes this kind of clustering industry co-operation and academic co-operation piece.

That is an important detail.<\/p> <p>  On top of that, regarding the hotlist of most active countries, I will refer to a recent Microsoft report that backs up decades of industry experience.  The four countries seen as largely responsible for the bulk of cybersecurity incidents are the Russian state, which is responsible for up to 65% of cybersecurity incidents globally, according to the Microsoft report published late last year, China, North Korea and Iran.  Those are the four states generally regarded in the literature as being responsible for the majority of cyberattack offences.

I will explain in slightly more detail.  In the first instance, the recourse under international law is usually against states, not individuals.  Therefore, if an individual happens to be in a state, the action is usually criminal.  It is an extradition-type process.  Obtaining sufficient proof and identifying individuals in these cases is extremely difficult.  This is a criminal matter for the Garda.  The Garda has had some success in taking down a domain used by the attackers and has traced some of the route of the data as they made their way out of HSE systems and, presumably, back to the systems of the threat actor.  All of that gets you only so far.  If the host nation is not willing to play ball on a law enforcement basis - and in this case the Russian state does not have a very positive history of engagement with criminal investigations in this way - then one is relatively limited in what one can do in that regard.  That is not to say nothing can be done.  That is a really important point.  We have joined an international counter-ransomware initiative run by the National Security Council, NSC, in the White House.  We engage very closely with our European and international colleagues on incident response and investigations - not law enforcement investigations as that is a criminal issue, but in the cybersecurity world.  That is to understand exactly who these people are individually, what tools they use, how to better defend against them and how to ensure that, in due course, albeit maybe not this year, somebody will be able to put a finger on them and arrest them or whatever.  That is a long process but, similarly, there is a long history of cybersecurity actors and criminals being picked up and arrested in international airports after multi-annual, multinational investigations.

I am sure his role is currently under a lot of scrutiny, and rightly so.  We are in a very different time from three or four years ago.  There is more global instability.  I think we would all agree on that point.  There appears to be an increase in espionage activity in this State.  That has proven to be the case with the expulsion of four Russian diplomats.  Although not much information on that has been given, it was done in the context of espionage in other European countries, so it is clear that that is going on.  Has Dr. Browne confidence that if we were to come under attack again in a similar way to what happened last year, our services, particularly the HSE, would be able to sustain such an attack?  Has the NCSC put defensive measures in place that would allow the HSE's IT system to be better protected than it was over a year ago?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#N01300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>There were two very distinct questions there but there is a common theme to them.  It is really important to note that entities are responsible for their own security, so the HSE and hospitals are responsible for and own their own security risk.  We can say with certainty, however, that the HSE has taken very significant measures to defend and to harden its own systems and to identify issues as they arise.  Without going into any great detail, incidents happen all the time.  For the very most part, they are dealt with long before they get to the point of last May's incident.  We see incidents happen very regularly.  It is not that we have an incident once every six months; we have one several times a day.  Most of them, however, are dealt with long before they ever eventuate to that point.  This goes to the Deputy's other point as to what we would do if we were to have an incident.  We have incidents all the time.  The question is what we do.

Dr. Browne must appreciate that that is a huge concern for us as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and as members of this committee, which has to scrutinise the NCSC's work.

If that gap analysis and that process identifies issues, we audit them using an external company, not the NCSC.  We have an independent audit of company X, Y or Z, or the entity involved.

Some of the audits we are doing this year are essentially catch-up audits.  We are checking up to ensure everything they said had been done has been completed.  We are in a much more highly advanced and mature stage than we were when we started out.  It is one of the reasons handing off the compliance process is now possible.  We are not at a baseline anymore.  We have a set of critical infrastructure operators that are operating mature, largely compliant models.  Where they are not compliant, they are in a process with us whereby they will be by the end of the year.

I was a teacher and other members were in different walks of life before entering the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It concerned me that the computer in my classroom held very sensitive data relating to child protection and children's vulnerabilities, learning needs, educational needs, parental circumstances and so on.  There was a whole lot of data on that computer, which was just in a primary school classroom.  If you go half a kilometre down the road to your local HSE public health centre, you will find another data set.  There is another in the local Garda station.  There is a data set in each community service.  People talk about hubs and spokes but the Government has tentacles of public service in each and every community in the country.  Some of those data are held on computers that are 15 or 20 years old and are operating on old systems.  They might be connected to the mother ship of the Department of Education or the Department of Justice but they are outposts and I do not believe they are sufficiently protected.  Does Dr. Browne share that concern?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#P02400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1261,"content":"<p>I have referred to this already in respect of the voluntary sector.  It is a very significant challenge.  Colleagues in other European jurisdictions had this exact discussion with the UK relatively recently.  There is no cheap or simple solution to these questions.  The UK's public sector cybersecurity strategy commits to having systems in place to deal with these kinds of questions by 2030, so this is a common issue elsewhere.  These kinds of challenges arise because cybersecurity has arrived on top of an extant structure of IT and IT governance which evolved over a long period of time.  As the Deputy has said, individual schools, clinics, clinical settings including dental surgeries and a wide range of other organisations hold data, including, in some cases, clinical data, on services that are not certified or unified.  In many of these cases, the solution is to unify IT services or to change the structure through which they are provided.  This is happening in central government, in the university sector and in other sectors.  There are other sectors, including the education sector, that will be really challenging to deal with.  We do not have a specific programme in place for securing educational IT but this is something that will have to be dealt with by means of centralised ICT procurement in the Department of Education.  It is not a simple process.  Who owns the school?  Who owns the computer?  Who owns the data?  Who is the data controller?  None of these questions are readily resolvable by anybody in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#P02500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Richard Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>I will wrap up by referencing one final thing.

In 2012, I retired at the rank of associate professor as head of the School of Computing in DCU.  My research area is cryptography.  Immediately after leaving DCU, I co-founded a start-up, Miracl.com, based on this research in the area of cybersecurity.  I am currently employed full-time working in a cybersecurity role in Abu Dhabi.  I was a contributor to the report from the Commission on Electronic voting that lead to the scrapping of insecure electronic voting machines in Ireland back in 2006.  While in DCU, I shared responsibility for pioneering a master's degree in security and forensic computing, one of the first cybersecurity master's degrees in either Ireland or the UK, and which has been running for at least the last 20 years.  I have been keenly following cybersecurity-related developments in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>There can be no doubt that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has heightened the global concern around issues of cybersecurity and their potential impact on our sovereignty.  There is no Geneva Convention in cyberspace; anything goes.  Attackers can be hard to trace, and they often maintain a plausible deniability relationship with their governments.  Critical systems depend on computers that can be hacked.  The ransomware attack on the HSE demonstrated the real-world damage that can be done.  Incurring the displeasure of physically distant foreign governments can now have serious local consequences.<br\/><br\/>On our response to date, fortunately, due to our intervention back in 2006, the Irish electoral system is secure, based as it is on complete transparency and the non-use of Internet-connectable devices or &quot;stupid old pencils&quot;, as members will recall them being called.  Thus, our electoral system is beyond the reach of cyberattackers.  However, that was a close-run thing.  There was a lot of naivety back then, but as luck would have it we avoided a trap that many other countries have stepped into in the supposed interests of modernising their electoral systems, while completely ignoring the complex security issues that can arise.  Therefore, more by accident than design, we got off to a good start in the cybersecurity stakes.<br\/><br\/>Academia was not slow either.  In academic circles, the growing importance of cybersecurity as a discipline was realised early on.  Indeed, since the turn of the millennium, universities have maintained a steady stream of cybersecurity graduates to satisfy a growing demand from the private sector.  There was a lot of awareness that cybersecurity was going to be a big thing.<br\/><br\/>However, in 2012, six years after the voting machine controversy, the European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA, published a report which described the evolution of cybersecurity strategies of each of the EU member states.  The report is still available online.  Even Luxembourg gets a mention, but Ireland is not mentioned at all.  Clearly, we were right at the back of the European pack, literally doing nothing at a national level that the EU could detect, back in 2012.  Thus, 2012 is year zero for Ireland's national efforts in cybersecurity.  Probably as a consequence of the ENISA report, the NCSC was established.  However, I suspect that we were just doing the minimum necessary to placate the EU.  Investment was minimal.  As far as I could make out at the time, the NCSC was a kind of two-men-and-a-dog operation working out of a couple of rooms in UCD.<br\/><br\/>Fast forward, then, to the Government&rsquo;s completely inadequate response to more nudging from the EU, with the launch of the National Cyber Security Strategy 2019-2024, which I interpreted as a can-kicking exercise.  The NCSC was to be expanded and provided with more resources.  When the HSE hack happened in May 2021, it was certainly a wake-up call.  The response was not at all impressive.  While I was following the media coverage, I was unaware of any expert response from the NCSC, and I could not name the equivalent of the Tony Holohan figure who might have provided some reassurance to the public that we had this under control.  In fact, despite closely following the media coverage, I was unaware of any NCSC response whatsoever to the crisis.  The NCSC itself is shrouded in secrecy, so I can only make a few observations about it.  It appears to have been under the same leadership since its foundation.  Its website contains no names.  There is not a single name of an individual on the website.  All the articles are anonymous.  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>published an interview with the centre's director in 2021.  Such an interview was described, in the article, as being rare, and no photograph of the director was allowed to appear next to the article.  I can conclude, therefore, that a culture of secrecy exists within the NCSC.  Personally, I have seen no job advertisements for the NCSC.  My suspicion is that it is, in fact, largely staffed by secondments from other services.<br\/><br\/>At a meeting of this committee in September 2021, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, said &quot;Most of what is being done is not secret and does not need to be hidden from people&quot;.  However, in reality, it is secret and it is hidden.  At the same meeting, an independently commissioned report, which was heavily redacted, nonetheless concluded that the NCSC was not fit for purpose as it was under-resourced and overtasked and its structural legislative foundations were totally inadequate.  In short, the NCSC is secretive to the point of being invisible.  Based on the redacted report and the HSE debacle, it seems reasonable to conclude that it is also largely ineffectual.<br\/><br\/>Here we are, facing into a deteriorating cybersecurity landscape, a situation made worse by the crisis in Ukraine.  We are woefully unprepared, while being an attractive target for attack.  We are, after all, a member of the UN Security Council.  Expelling Russian diplomats can almost be guaranteed to provoke a dangerous response.  We really need to start taking this seriously.  Given our generally high standing in the world of IT, it is all rather embarrassing.  As stated, I am currently working in the United Arab Emirates, a country comparable in size to Ireland, where they take cybersecurity very seriously and have shown themselves willing to make the necessary investment to build a strong centre of excellence in the area of cybersecurity to defend their national interests.  This stands in stark contrast to the situation in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make one last point.  As I said in my introduction, there is no Geneva Convention in cyberspace.  Therefore, the ability to counterpunch is an absolute necessity.  It may go against the grain and against our traditions to develop an offensive capability, but as a means of deterrence, I believe it to be absolutely necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Scott"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Scott.

The last time we were here, members asked contributors about the emerging trends we saw in the cybersecurity realm affecting our clients and what was required to mitigate such threats.  The last hearing took place in the ominous shadow of the HSE attack.  Since then, cyberwarfare threats have escalated in a manner and in a timeframe which has blindsided the majority.<\/p> <p>  On foot of the Ukraine invasion, Ward Solutions, the organisation of which I am CEO, notified our clients in our situational security advisories of what we believed to be significantly increased risks to them, including increased criminal activity capitalising on the emotive curiosity arising from the war; increased cybermilitia activity from both global and local activists, attacking Russia, Ukraine or western countries with commensurate direct or collateral damage and the associated problems with attribution and blame; increased nation-state activity responding to geopolitical objectives, for example, cyberactions as part of hybrid warfare, malicious reaction to sanctions and counterstrikes to actual or perceived nation-state cyberactivity; failure of risk transference mechanisms, such as cyberinsurance, arising from policy exclusions for cyberevents originating from nation-state activities or acts of war; attacks and disruption to nearstream and downstream supply chains of national and global critical national infrastructure providers such as finance, health, utilities, telecoms, cloud services, software-as-a-service and transportation; the lack of capacity issue for already stretched cyberservice providers to support wider-scale attacks; and accelerated segregation or cyberbalkanisation of the Internet. <\/p> <p>  We continue to advise our clients on actions that should be undertaken, based on urgently revising risk assessment, mitigation and security operation plans.  This encompasses increasing awareness, increasing security controls, performing basic and advanced cybersecurity tasks better, testing and rehearsing incident response plans, and disaster recovery.  We have advised our clients of the need to maintain a hypervigilant security posture for the long term, planning their programmes and resources accordingly.<\/p> <p>  When we consider the tragedy and adversity of the Ukraine invasion, where Ireland is not politically neutral, along with the previous HSE cyberattack, where Ireland was at that time in a politically neutral state, we can see that neither aligned nor non-aligned status offers us effective protection from nation-state, militia or criminal cyberattacks.  On a daily basis, Ward Solutions continues to deal with ever-growing operationally and financially crippling cybercriminal activity against our clients, regardless of the current geopolitical situation.<\/p> <p>  Once again, I am appealing to this committee and to anyone who will listen.  I am advocating the need for a more comprehensive, robust, better resourced and highly innovative national cybersecurity strategy that is integrated as part of our national security strategy to protect Ireland.  We have started the journey and made some inroads, but we are nowhere near the levels of protection we require for this decade and the rate at which the threats are developing.  Time is of the essence.  We have seen malevolent nation-state activity for over 15 years.  Ireland has been hit both directly and indirectly.  National cybersecurity strategy, practice, capacity, resources, research and capability is not something that we can switch on in days and weeks in response to a specific crisis.  It requires deliberate planning and constant adaptation to extract short- and long-term success.  The strategy is needed to protect our society, citizens, public and private services and our prosperity.  If it is well executed, it will also bring very significant economic benefits to Ireland.  The direct cybersecurity market is estimated to be worth $270 billion by 2026.  There is a significant digital sector, which is heavily cybersecurity-dependent.  An effective national cybersecurity strategy offers multiple levels of payback which can not only fund the strategy but also return real profits in terms of investment, jobs, export revenue and corporate taxes from the direct cybersecurity sector and from the cybersecurity-dependent sectors.  The State&rsquo;s role in this strategy should be that of leader, co-ordinator, enabler, incubator and accelerator.<\/p><p> I am also a member of Cyber Ireland, the chairman and cluster manager of which made a presentation to the joint committee in 2021.  We have been steadily working over the past four years to co-ordinate the triple helix of industry, government and academia in order to make Ireland a cybersecurity global leader.  As part of our work, Cyber Ireland recently commissioned an international expert study of the cybersecurity sector in Ireland and will launch this study and an accompanying sectoral policy paper in May 2022.  Both will be submitted to this committee.  We believe they will be invaluable to members' considerations on Ireland&rsquo;s cybersecurity strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1280,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Larkin and invite Mr. O'Reilly to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#S00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1281,"content":"<p>This topic is timely and of significant consequence.  As we all saw last year, certain nation states and criminal gangs that operate within those states pose a significant threat to the public and private sectors throughout the West.  Much of my work is in advancing the maturity of risk management practices inside large and small entities.  I work with critical infrastructure, or essential services, across large enterprise corporations, governments in the US and elsewhere, and smaller concerns such as state and local government and small to medium-sized companies.  Consequently, I have a fairly broad understanding of the challenges in critical infrastructure and shifting threat actor profiles.  I also work closely with many of the firms that model cyber-risk and suggest an efficient path to mitigation and the hardening of systems.  This gives me a good, high-level sense of where weaknesses persist and what efficient and cost-effective paths to the prevention of cyberincidents look like.<\/p> <p>  As we all saw in 2021, there was, effectively, a plague of ransomware.  Several of these attacks became very high profile and did serious harm to citizens.  Any attack on a health service should be off limits, yet criminal gangs have crossed that line several times.  Attacks on critical infrastructure also become political very quickly, as we saw with the Colonial Pipeline attack last year in the US.  To get an idea of frequencies and impacts, almost one third of all healthcare organisations have reported an attempt at ransomware.  The rate is almost double in manufacturing.  Slightly over 40% are able to restore their system from back-up and only about one third will pay the ransom.  The average loss in healthcare from a ransomware event is $1.27 million, but the secondary losses drive that figure much higher.  There are then the human costs, which are, obviously, even more significant.<\/p> <p>  The heightened threat in the wake of geopolitical events should concern all essential services or critical infrastructure firms, and all should be on heightened alert and take measures to harden systems.  More than 80% of critical infrastructure is in private ownership in the US, which produces a difficult circumstance in that public goods and services and their protection often fall outside the purview of regulation.  This means the government has to be a helpful partner, stay apprised of a multitude of potential threats and get that information to the private sector in an efficient manner.  Government has an important role to play in combating these threats and in helping essential services to understand current best practice.  Many sectors are underfunded and the authority for security is decentralised.  Water treatment is a prime example of this.<\/p> <p>  Attackers use many different tactics, techniques and procedures.  The practice of risk management combines an analysis of the threat actors, their methods and the existing vulnerabilities in systems, and then looks at the essential functions of the business.  After a probabilistic analysis has been carried out, the potential impacts can be understood, including the human cost, financial impacts, downtime, reputational damage and lawsuits - all are factored.  It is complex, but the results are often simple.  Reporters often ask me what can be done, as though the challenge were insurmountable, but it is not.  There are many simple and cost-effective strategies both to prevent attacks and to mitigate the potential losses if an attack gains a foothold, but they require proper risk management and full engagement from governance structures.<\/p> <p>  In cyber, when we hear intelligence that criminal gangs with nation-state cover are preparing for attacks, we think of essential services.  We think of the grid, healthcare and the supply chain for food and water, but many resources are available and not all of them are expensive.  Many attacks begin because of a trivial oversight or a failure to have trained employees properly.  The message of proper risk management in cyber is a largely positive one.  That is not to say it does not entail significant complexity; it does.  It also requires resources, but resources that are deployed wisely.  The recent cyber Bill in the US details how risk management in cyber should operate and is a big step in countering the advanced persistent threat.  It also puts more requirements around cyberincident reporting, which will get better information into the hands of practitioners faster.  The practice of cyber is changing, as it must to meet the current challenges.  I look forward to our discourse today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1282,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#S00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1283,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their excellent contributions.

The analogue for me, when I was thinking it through, was the Colonial Pipeline attack and how a small number of staff at the US Transportation Security Administration, TSA, were looking at it and being supervisory.  That was woefully inadequate and it was directly analogous to what Ireland was dealing with at the time, in respect of the size of both the staff and the problem.  The essential services sector here is large, as is the critical infrastructure sector.  A small group, therefore, of five or six employees at TSA with oversight for pipeline security was not going to get the job done.  Immediately, therefore, our legislators put more regulatory heft behind it and it is now being moved from being voluntary to more direct requirements and regulation.  We are transitioning that.<\/p> <p>  As for the recent Act that has emerged, I do not think there is any analogue in Ireland, as far as I know.  That said, while we have an entire agency - the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA - with a very large budget that is in charge of critical infrastructure, we still have problems.<\/p><p>The Russians have still infiltrated the government and energy sector here.  We recently had an alert and unsealed some indictments around Russian actors from 2011 to 2018 who were doing espionage and basically exfiltrating data.

In fairness, some of them have dealt with it in the sense that Ireland is almost a tech superpower and, on that basis, there is the idea that we have a huge amount of cybersecurity expertise, although we have not necessarily put that together.  We all welcome the fact there was a capacity review of the NCSC and, following that, premises were put in place and the numbers are being increased.  We also had Dr. Richard Browne before the committee.  We have probably got a greater amount of information than we were able to get at the time of the HSE attack but the fact is the world has changed following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  A number of Russian diplomats or operatives, or whatever term anyone wants to put on them, have been expelled.<\/p> <p>  We all know about the idea of asymmetric warfare at this point in time, and whether it is hybrid or cyber, we have to take it into account in a major way.  It is something we have to look at.  We all got the idea of what we were facing at the time of the HSE attack.  We have an imminent threat from criminal enterprises and I would make an argument that some of these may operate as subcontractors of the Russian state and others who can employ them from time to time.  Dr. Browne stated that that has not been proven, but he was not inferring there was no chance that this was the case and he was just putting the facts on the table.<\/p> <p>  I would like to get the expert opinion of the witnesses.  I understand that a significant amount of the defences are making sure that decent digital hygiene is being operated.  In the case of the HSE, we saw that was not the case.

To deal with the present circumstances, I would like to get the knowledge from the experts in the field.  I ask the witnesses to state very specifically the risks that we are facing and what exactly it would require for us to protect ourselves.

With regard to land, we have had reasonable integrity for the last 100 years or so, and we have not really had a viable land threat in the recent past.  We are obviously worried about sea and air but, realistically, that is not impacting us.  Cyber is impacting on us daily.  We are dealing with customers who are losing millions of euro in cyberattacks, and that is in the commercial sector and some critical national infrastructure providers.  The cyber realm is being penetrated daily.  In the current geopolitical circumstances, we get the sense that in being on the wrong side of a particular alliance or in not being politically neutral, a cyberthreat can be effected very significantly against Ireland.  If we look at the resources struggle to respond to the HSE attack, the NCSC response was broadly good given our experience in this field, but if there was a wider-scale attack, there are not the resources, public and private, in Ireland to deal with it significantly.

I ask all the delegates to deal with this in their own way.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Scott said that there was no strategy for cybersecurity up to 2012.  Given that the NHS was hammered in the UK and we did not test our systems in this country, I would have believed there was zero strategy up to 2021.  We were paying lip service to it.<\/p> <p>  Let me outline what I want to establish today.  Dr. Scott said that if a matter is put under the Department of the Taoiseach, it gives it an air of importance.  In our recent encounter with the director of cybersecurity, the latter disputed that.  He said that being under the Department of the Taoiseach did not necessarily make it any better than it was.  However, in my view, giving responsibility to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications rather than the Department of Defence seems a nonsense.  We are not analysing matters through a security lens all the time.  Everything we do now should be analysed through a security lens, particularly a cybersecurity lens.  I would like the witnesses to give their view on this.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in Mr. Larkin's point that we have been good at looking at land, sea and air, albeit with major restrictions and diminishing capability, but I do not believe we have looked at cybersecurity and taken it seriously.  I still do not believe we are doing so, considering that we are talking about a staff of 70.  I asked earlier today whether we should have cyberpersonnel reporting directly to the head of cybersecurity in every State and semi-State department.  To protect the economy, should we not be proactively hacking organisations ethically to find breaches and telling them they will be removed from the wide-area network if they do not repair the breaches within a limited time that is specified?  Mr. Larkin was very clear that this is an economic issue as well as a security issue.  A nanosecond of carelessness could cost us our entire economy.  It could cripple it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#U00600","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1314,"content":"<p>The Senator might ask his questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#U00700","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>What I am trying to do is map out what I believe cybersecurity should be.

I regard the UK as a model.  It has had a number of goes at it, the most recent of which has been pretty good in respect of the role of the UK National Cyber Security Centre and the level of leadership it has provided.  That is not a bad model.  Again, it is a matter of continuous improvement and evolution because circumstances change.  What does perfect look like?  What does the desired state look like?  The desired state looks like one in which everybody takes cybersecurity seriously and responsibly.  Most commercial institutions, regardless of whether they are quasi-semi-State, take cybersecurity seriously.  Why?  It is because it is about protecting shareholder investment and revenue.  If Ireland Inc. treated it the same way, it would be about protecting our tax flows, health service, foreign direct investment and national output, meaning everybody would take it appropriately seriously.<\/p><p>We have seen the escalating threat.  I use the term \"lucky\" advisedly, but we have been lucky that the HSE was able to recover as quickly as it could.  I am sure there has been worse patient mortality as a result of it, as well as significant costs, and it is not finished yet.  The model should be that everyone is educated and takes cybersecurity seriously, with co-ordination and leadership at the top.  It will be impossible if it is left to a single body to drive, execute and implement all of this.  Leadership is needed, with a clear statement that it is a national and economic security priority.  It should be addressed with all involved agencies.  We have a problem, which is that this is very much an infinite defence mindset, which we are not resourced for.  Regarding Dr. Scott's earlier point, infinite defence is fine if one is confident about the ability to tire the enemy exhaustively or is in a position to launch a counterattack.  There need to be consequences for cartels or nation states that launch or facilitate cyberattacks, otherwise we will be in an infinite defence model and a cyber arms race.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#U01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1320,"content":"<p>Is it this abatement that is spoken about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#V00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1321,"content":"<p>There have to be consequences.

I do not know why cybersecurity is handled where it is at present.  It seems slightly bizarre.  I am sure there is some historical justification for it.  I will explain one of the differences in Ireland.  Countries like the UK had something in place prior to cybersecurity being an issue - they had signals intelligence with organisations such as MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.  They always had an interest in this area, and cybersecurity fitted nicely into and developed from that.  The military complex was a good starting point for issues of cybersecurity.  We did not have any of that in Ireland.  We came naked into the world in 2012.  That could have been an opportunity to get it right, but unfortunately we did not.  We lagged behind and were tardy in our response.  We have got to the current situation, where danger has ramped up far ahead of our defensive capability.  We are in a sorry state, one of confusion, about how to proceed.  We need to take this seriously, make a serious investment, and try to get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Scott"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1325,"content":"<p>We have a strong deterrent capability in the USA.  In the UK, this was always on the radar of the military.  President Biden's announcement, red lines and so on are a strong deterrent.  There is tacit acknowledgement by criminal gangs that certain types of critical infrastructure attacks are off limits.  It looks like we are maybe in a holding pattern.  The ability to take criminal gangs offline, which the FBI, CISA and the military demonstrated last year, is a powerful deterrent.  The problem is that it quickly gets geopolitical.  It can probably escalate.  I cannot speak for my Government, but there is probably much caution with this because it can escalate.  This is brand new territory.  There is no real theory of cyberwarfare yet.  There is the beginnings of one.  Cyber moving to kinetic is also a threat and we need a deterrent capability for that.  While it is a good exercise to think about whether a stronger, more robust programme can be developed, from my experience of risk management for critical infrastructure, even when there are strong recommendations for defensive capability, there is still resistance.<\/p> <p>  There is still much work to be done on risk management and getting the private sector that is involved in critical infrastructure to do the right thing.  This has largely been a governance problem.  I have seen many clients in the USA that had to report a breach.  The governance structure was then addressed.  Regulators put them on a programme to put in place a cybersecurity programme, report on it, and tie executive compensation to it, which tended to produce some results.  It is about a carrot and a stick, whether it is offensive or defensive capability.  While risk management has advanced significantly, we still have a problem with governance structures that are asleep at the wheel, though I do not mean to be unkind.

I am also aware of someone, who, by chance, after attending DCU, now works in the NCSC.  I will not make an argument regarding whether he was a good or bad student either.<\/p> <p>  We have discussed a fair amount.  In fairness, the witnesses have put on the record the reality of the world we live in.  There are two parts to this.  One is the ransomware and financial gain by criminal elements.  I have heard of many companies that have paid sizeable amounts of money in this regard - &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000.  I am not referring to huge companies, but SMEs.  Part of the reason they paid the money is that they did not want news getting out that their systems had been penetrated.  This type of criminality is also at times facilitated by rogue states.  We can state clearly that Russia, in doing that, provides itself with a subcontractor outfit that can do business for it when required.  We know the situation we are in now.  We are an IT superpower and that means we are wide open to this sort of stuff happening.<\/p> <p>  What do we need to do?  There are two parts to addressing this issue.  We must deal with regular criminal cyberattacks for financial gain.  Additionally, we must talk about state actors, cyberespionage and the difficulty involved with the denial of vital services.  The worst-case scenario in that context is where cyberattacks transfer to the physical realm.  We are accepting the idea here, in respect of protecting ourselves, that we will be fine if everyone operates the best-case digital hygiene.  Someone has to co-ordinate that system, however, and be in charge of it.  The NCSC has a particular role, but many gaps remain in regard to the threats we are facing.  In fairness, Mr. Larkin spoke about how globally, but especially in Ireland, we must get the show on the road concerning workforce planning and ensure we have sufficient people to fill the roles that must be undertaken.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that goes beyond cybersecurity involves connected networks.  Ireland has social media companies that facilitate these networks.  This is sometimes the stuff of conspiracy theories, but state actors have the ability to use such networks from a disinformation perspective, which can be part of such actors' hybrid warfare strategies.  I ask all the witnesses to comment on all these aspects in the few remaining minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#W04100","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1648594800,"counter":1379,"content":"<p>We will start with Mr. O'Reilly.

Regarding the aspect of social media warfare, that must be countered.  This also connects with Ireland wanting to get some of its agencies more proactive in how they address the public.<\/p><p>One of the good things that CISA has done recently in the US is to talk regularly to the public.  It talks regularly to the critical infrastructure sectors.  The White House makes weekly announcements on cybersecurity.  There has been a big public relations push.  I regularly talk to reporters.  It is in the news all the time and should become a part of the culture.  The countering of cyberwarfare must become a part of the culture.  Everyone, in some respect, is a soldier.  That goes to the idea of training the requisite staff to address these issues.  The cyber skills gap is profound.  It is profound when I look for help in my company and across the entire country at the moment.  It is a wonderful and fascinating field and it should be characterised as such to get young people interested.  It is endlessly fascinating.<\/p><p> I work in risk management and build software that deals with risk management.  It is necessary to have some idea of where one is at the moment.  In the cyber world, we call it a baseline.  One can consider an offensive capability but that is only a part of the picture.  When we deal with companies that are trying to ward off these threats, we give them the tools of risk management.  That is the ability to identify bad things, how likely they are to happen, how they might impact the company and how systems should be hardened in response.  That concerns incident response.<\/p><p> When forensics are applied after an event, it is clear that cybercriminals are not using the most sophisticated techniques.  There is a lot of spear phishing and brute force password attacks.  Some of the highest profile breaches in the US were the result of not having two-factor authentication on a remote desktop protocol.  It is not the most expensive thing in the world.  Cyberhygiene and risk management are vital.  It is also necessary to have some idea of where one's essential services sit at the moment with respect to those practices.  That is going on over here in the US.  Risk management came through the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, two sections of which deal with metrics around risk management.  The problem will not be solved if it is just addressed by putting a finger in the dyke and deploying stopgap measures.  It must be considered from the top down from the point of view of the governance structures.  Resourcing is absolutely essential.  The function of governance is to resource solutions to these problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022033000002#W04300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648594800,"counter":1382,"content":"<p>I will add some short, final words.  This issue is not going to go away.  It is going to get worse before it gets better and we need to do something.  One thing I would like to see happen is a change of culture at the NCSC.  That is something we can do in the short term.  The NCSC needs to come out from behind its walls, interact and take on a much more public role.  During the pandemic, there were many people we could talk to who were more than willing to come out and talk about viruses, vaccines and all the rest of it.  We need the NCSC to come out to interact with and educate the public, which would allow us to feel comfortable and not to panic or overreact.  The NCSC should be telling us calmly and seriously that we have these issues under control, that we have the expertise, and that anyone with a problem should call X, Y or Z.

That is the role of the State, whether it falls to the NCSC, the Taoiseach or whoever else.  On Mr. O'Reilly's point, we must be highly innovative on cybersecurity.  We must produce a mainstream of core cybersecurity professionals.  There is a simple model that would build cybersecurity knowledge, which is simply to embed a relevant cyber-related module in all professional and academic courses.  I am formerly of the Defence Forces and my former colleagues tell me they run 2,000 or 3,000 people through a career course every year.  If we added a cyber module to that course, we would produce 2,000 or 3,000 cybersoldiers every year.  Culturally, the organisation is asking what to do with them.  They will leave.  We can tell the Defence Forces that they are producing people who can defend the cyber realm, no matter the role they are in, for the Defence Forces.  The same applies to lawyers, teachers, academics and public servants.  Including those modules in courses would build a cybersavvy workforce and citizenry.
