I welcome everyone to the meeting.  While Covid-19 restrictions are receding and it is open to members and witnesses to attend meetings in person, I ask those doing so to continue to wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and joins us this morning.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this meeting is to engage with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine the following matters: the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 34 - housing, local government and heritage; from the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2020, chapter 3, central government funding of local authorities, and chapter 8, oversight of the housing assistance payment, HAP; and the 2020 Local Government Fund account.  The Department has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters during the course of our engagement: EU fines in respect of Derrybrien Wind Farm, Galway; women's refuges; and cost-rental expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department: Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General; Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, planning division; Ms &Aacute;ine Stapleton, assistant secretary, social housing delivery division; Ms Caroline Timmons, acting assistant secretary, housing affordability, inclusion and homelessness division; Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue, principal officer, local government division; and Ms Marguerite Ryan, all importantly, finance officer.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Clare Costello, principal officer in the housing, local government and heritage Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome.  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback and, as usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  One of today's witnesses is to give her evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  She has already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p>  <p>  To start, I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645090200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 34 - housing, local government and heritage - records gross expenditure of &euro;5.27 billion.  The appropriation account is presented under five programme headings.  The largest by value are the housing programme, the water services programme and the programme to support local government.  The surplus at the year end was &euro;226.5 million.  Of this, &euro;214 million related to unspent allocations in respect of planned capital investments, which were carried forward to 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the account.  I drew attention, however, to a note in the account that discloses payment of a fine to the European Commission arising from a judgment of the European Court of Justice in November 2019.  The case concerned the failure to ensure that a retrospective environmental impact assessment was carried out in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway.  The fine imposed comprises a &euro;5 million lump-sum payment plus a daily fine of &euro;15,000 while the infringement continues, plus legal costs.  The amount paid to the Commission in 2020 totalled &euro;7.745 million, and a further liability of &euro;2.745 million was accrued by the end of 2020.  The daily fine was ongoing at the time we were completing the audit of the account and we estimated that it could result in a potential further liability of &euro;5.5 million in respect of 2021.  I also drew attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal financial control in respect of three non-compliant procurement contracts operated by the Department during the year.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government Fund is managed by the Department separately from the Vote.  The fund comprises mainly the proceeds of the local property tax, LPT, and a transfer from the Vote.  In 2020, LPT receipts into the fund amounted to &euro;482 million.  This was up marginally from the level of LPT receipts in 2019.  The transfer to the fund from the Vote in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.1 billion.  This was up &euro;871 million, or 470%, year on year.  The increase was to cover the cost of the Covid-related commercial rates waiver and of certain additional supports to local authorities.  The fund expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.5 billion.  The bulk of this was accounted for by transfers to local authorities.  At end December 2020, the fund's reserves stood at just under &euro;140 million.<\/p> <p>I issued a clear audit opinion also in relation to the fund account.<\/p> <p> Due to the complex ways that central government funds flow to individual local authorities, chapter 3 is compiled each year to present an overview of the level and purpose of the funding provided.  In 2020, total funding to local authorities from central government sources was &euro;6.08 billion, an increase of 46% on the &euro;4.17 billion provided in 2019.<\/p> <p> I turn now to chapter 8, which deals with oversight of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  The HAP scheme, while funded by the Department, is operated by the local authorities.  As members are aware, the scheme aims to cater for households with a long-term housing need in a unified system of support.  There has been a steady increase in the number of households receiving support under the scheme.  In 2020, the Department spent almost &euro;465 million on HAP, supporting nearly 60,000 tenants at an average annual cost of &euro;7,800 per tenancy supported.  The cost to the Exchequer is net of rent contributions collected from tenants.<\/p> <p> The examination found that while market rental costs were increasing, the maximum rents payable by the State under HAP had not been revised since 2017.  Some tenants make top-up payments to cover any difference between the rent payable to the landlord and the maximum rent payable by the State.  A review carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform found that around 28% of HAP tenants were making top-up payments to landlords in the first half of 2019.  The examination found that no more recent data were available on the extent of these payments, and that such top-up payments were not routinely tracked by the Department.  The HAP scheme also has an objective to improve regulation of the private tenancy sector, which is met by the legal requirements for local authorities to inspect HAP properties.  The examination found that the Department did not have information on the proportion of proposed HAP tenancies actually inspected or on the results of those inspections.<\/p> <p> The report makes several recommendations for improvement in the Department&rsquo;s oversight and management of HAP, including monitoring the effectiveness of HAP, which the Department has accepted.  The Accounting Officer will be in a position to provide an update on any progress made regarding their implementation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645090200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am joined by my colleagues from the Department, whom the Chairman has already introduced.  We look forward to discussing the expenditure and activity of the Department in 2020 with the members.  As time is limited, I will not go through every area of expenditure but I will touch on the key areas briefly.  I provided some advance briefing information before the meeting and a copy of my opening statement.  We have also provided advance written briefing material on areas specifically sought by the committee, namely Derrybrien, refuges for those experiencing domestic violence and cost-rental expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the appropriation account for Vote 34 and the related chapters.  I recognise and appreciate the value of this work in the context of enhancing the outward demonstration, not only to this committee, but to the public, of the important work done by the Department and the value we put on transparency and accountability.  In particular, the period under examination covered the first phase of remote working, and I acknowledge the level of professionalism demonstrated during that new context.  As with previous recommendations, we will continue to evolve and mature our systems and reporting to align with best practice wherever possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2020, as set out in the appropriation account before the committee, totalled some &euro;5.3 billion, or a 33% increase on the expenditure in the previous year.  As the committee will be aware, 2020 was a unique year concerning activity and finance in the context of the onset of the pandemic and the range of responses put in place across Government.  The Estimates process for 2020 did not take place until autumn, and this meant that certain provisions for the July stimulus and the rates waivers formed part of the final Estimate for the Department.<\/p>  <p>  There were subsequent Supplementary Estimates in the areas of housing and water to facilitate further stimulus activity and additional funding for local government to support the final three months of the rates waiver.  In recognition of the impact of construction closures on expenditure, some &euro;214 million of unspent capital allocations was carried forward for spending in 2021.  Throughout 2020, the Department kept a close eye on activity and expenditure in the context of the pandemic.  At the first indication of potential remote working, we established critical payment teams to ensure that there would be no interruption to payments in the various significant areas.  When a full lock-down became inevitable, we had a process in place which saw the designation of essential sites for social housing, meaning that there would be a flow of near-complete homes for tenanting.  We worked with local authorities and delivery partners in respect of vulnerable households, including those in congregated emergency accommodation, as well as Traveller accommodation, to ensure they could be kept as safe as possible.  Working across Government, we harnessed the July stimulus package to channel investment back into businesses.  We worked with colleagues in the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment on the rates waiver to alleviate challenges for businesses.<\/p>  <p>  On housing, the focus of the Department&rsquo;s 2020 activity was initially driven by the actions set out in the Rebuilding Ireland policy, which was then succeeded by the programme for Government, and, in turn, subsequently became the basis for the Housing for All policy.  The Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the appropriation account, was &euro;2.6 billion in 2020.  A further &euro;92 million was available from the local property tax, LPT, receipts to fund the housing programmes of certain local authorities.  Funding for the overall social housing provision represents the bulk of expenditure under the housing programme.  Delivery is achieved through build, acquisition, leasing, HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Within these headings are multiple sub-delivery vehicles, to achieve the optimum outcome for Exchequer investment.<\/p>  <p>  Each year, the Department channels capital and current investment strands to maximise new delivery of housing solutions and to ensure that the many tens of thousands of households already in receipt of a social support continue to be provided for.  In 2020, over &euro;2.6 billion was spent across 29 subheads under the housing programme.  Of this, &euro;1.5 billion was invested in the delivery of long-term homes under build, acquisition and leasing programmes and &euro;600 million was allocated to supporting new and existing social tenancies under RAS and HAP, with the remainder used to deliver on services for homeless households, private housing grants, Traveller accommodation, energy efficiency etc.  In 2020, over 24,000 households had their housing needs met through the allocation of the supports provided by HAP and RAS.  A total of 7,824 new social homes were delivered in 2020, including 5,000 new-build homes, 1,300 targeted acquisitions by local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, and 1,400 homes delivered through leasing programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the incredibly challenging impact of Covid-19 on construction activity, the second half of 2020 saw a rebound with local authorities, approved housing bodies and other delivery partners anxious to make up lost ground.  I acknowledge that determination and co-operation, and the committee will be aware of the pressures on local authorities during the height of the pandemic.  Recognising the significant challenges for new housing delivery following the disruption caused by lockdown, the Department secured moneys in the July stimulus, which we used to refurbish vacant social housing stock to make it available for allocation to families and individuals on waiting lists.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1645090200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I do not like interrupting but we are going over time, so I ask Mr. Doyle to make some concluding remarks if he wishes to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700003#B00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645090200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Certainly.

The Derrybrien wind farm case refers to Ireland&rsquo;s non-compliance with a judgment in a European Court of Justice case from July 2008.  It is specifically about non-compliance with the development consent for a wind farm in Derrybrien, County Galway, and the environmental impact assessment directive.  The wind farm is owned and operated by a subsidiary of the ESB.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has set out that on foot of a finding against Ireland on this &mdash; it was a judgment in late 2019 &mdash; fines of about &euro;13 million, imposed by the Commission, have been paid by the State to date.  It was always the case that the judgment would be complied with once the wind farm was subjected to a retrospective environmental impact assessment, known as substitute consent.  That is a statutory process, essentially.  It required the ESB, as the owner and operator of the wind farm, to submit an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That was done in August 2020 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la very recently, in the past week or two, issued a finding against the application in that case.

In relation to the oversight arrangements, the Department engaged the Housing Agency last year to commission a report on the oversight of the HAP and the governance structures as it evolved through the set-up phase into consolidation.  That report actually aligned very well with some of the recommendations coming from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s audit.<\/p>  <p>  Under the initial structures, we had both an oversight group and a project board.  The recommendations coming through suggested we now needed to consolidate into one strong oversight group.  There was a strong recommendation in the report that the oversight group should not be chaired by either the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Department of Social Protection, but that we should bring some independence to the chair.  We have now brought in an independent chair in a newly constituted oversight group.<\/p>  <p>  The oversight group is currently working through its work programme and is very much guided in that work programme by the recommendations that have come through from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s audit.  Therefore, there is good alignment now between where we have got to on the governance structures and the oversight.<\/p>  <p>  The other piece of advice that came through from the Comptroller and Auditor General, on which we are following through, is that we should liaise with the Department of Social Protection and effectively learn best practice from it regarding the types of additional controls it exercises that we might replicate to support the controls that the Secretary General has referred to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700004#C01300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Stapleton"},{"type":"speech","time":1645090800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Stapleton very much for that update.

Providing affordable purchase, not just for people who are in the surrounding areas, but for children who have done well, have gone to college and have benefited from the supports we put into social programmes in Ballymun, want to come back to live beside their parents.  They want to buy a home.  We have 19 sites in Ballymun, 28 ha of land, all of which is in public ownership.  I do not yet feel the ambition to deliver on those.  They are all within our gift.

I understand there are a set of regulations going back to 2019 relating to standards in private rented accommodation, which are very clearly delineated.  I am struck by the fact, notwithstanding Covid-19 and the inability of people to inspect private rented accommodation that is subject to housing assistance payments, or even the rental accommodation scheme as we used to know it, of the dramatic drop-off in the number of inspections taking place.  The Minister's response to a parliamentary question I posed on 25 January clearly shows that up to quarter 3 of 2021, 11,731 inspections took place.  Those are the most up-to-date figures I have.

We are factoring in Covid-19.  We know there will be a drop-off so the officials do not need to respond to that.  That is a given and that is understood, but the number of prohibition notices that have been served out of those inspections is 15.  Even if we track back, taking into account Covid-19, in 2018, approximately 28,000 inspections were carried out with 99 prohibition notices served.  In 2019, 40,000 inspections were carried out with 106 notices served.  In 2020, approximately 26,000 inspections were carried out with 57 notices served and, as I said, there were 11,700 inspections up to quarter 3 of 2021 with 15 notices served.<\/p>  <p>  Do the officials agree that the number of prohibition notices served is extremely low?  I ask that because I have visited people of late who are in receipt of the housing assistance payment.  To describe the conditions they are living in as Dickensian would be to put it mildly.  I understand the local authorities have a tough job to do, but I would like to see some language coming from the Department in respect of buttressing the inspections regime by way of ensuring there is a clear policy that the regulations, which are laid down in law, are adhered to such that people have the right to live in some sort of decent accommodation.  I invite the officials to visit some of these dwellings for themselves.  They will see just how poor the level of accommodation is.  These people are caught in a major bind because they cannot go back to their landlord to ask him or her to fix this or that as they would be out on their ear before they know it.<\/p>  <p>  This is a major issue right across society when we are paying &euro;465 million on the housing assistance payment.  We should look at the rent supplement figure from the Department of Social Protection for 2021.  Under what we call provisional expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme 2021, the Department of Social Protection paid out &euro;122,957,000 in rent supplement.  We are paying out a massive amount of money.  I can understand why we are doing so.  We need to keep people in housing in the private rented sector until supply is sufficiently provided for, but the inspection regime is just not working.  I ask the officials to please not come back to me with Covid-19 as a reason.  A regime needs to be put in place such that the inspectorate is robust and local authorities are resourced commensurate with the number of properties in their purview.<\/p> <p>That is something that needs to be addressed urgently.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has given us the metric of 60,000 tenancies and &euro;465 million, which is coming in at, give or take, &euro;7,800 per tenancy.  Obviously, there has been no provision to revise upwards the rent provision to reflect the market in 2017.  The Secretary General will tell me there is a working group on that but there needs to be a greater degree of urgency.  If I could have an answer to that in two minutes or less, I would be delighted because there is one other issue I would like to cover as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700006#E01300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645092600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Certainly.

As he will be aware, they did try virtual inspections and I know they want to continue that and it may be one way to do things, but the physical inspections are important as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has seen there are low numbers of follow-through right to the end.

I appreciate the answer.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to water services, as a typical Deputy trying to get schemes up off the ground in regard to wastewater treatment plants and sewage treatment plants, and generally improve the condition of services, in particular water services, I recognise that some very good projects are under way right across the country under the ambit of Irish Water.  However, I am trying to understand what is the dynamic that is informing the relationship between Irish Water and the local authorities.  Is it the case that the service level agreements that are in place between the two entities will be set aside, such that all staff are now to transfer across to Irish Water?  If that is the case, what is the status of that process?  That is the first question.<\/p>  <p>  The second question relates to whether a scheme will be provided where there are small settlements or villages where the local authority is ready to go on a project, but it is not necessarily on a priority list for Irish Water.  Is there scope for the Department to step in to provide funding for local authorities for smaller schemes that are shovel-ready and that could get off the ground?  It would have tremendous impact.  If we do not have those types of schemes, people are subjected to an Irish Water list and they could be waiting until kingdom come to get their little village or settlement sorted out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700007#F01000","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645092600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>In terms of the water sector transformation programme, there are discussions ongoing within the WRC at present, as the Deputy will probably be aware, on the transfer of local authority staff to Irish Water, which will be on a voluntary basis.

I do not want to take up more of the Deputy&rsquo;s time on that.<\/p>  <p>  There is a significant amount of investment in the rural water schemes and those programmes.  In fact, while the amount was probably around the &euro;40 million mark in the past couple of years, the estimate for the current year is &euro;60 million to try to bring many of those rural local schemes up to a higher standard, to implement repairs and connections, and to support communities in terms of their endeavours in those spaces.

A local authority like Fingal County Council, for example, doubled its population between 1996 and 2016, the year of the most recent census, but population does not feature anywhere in the allocation provided.

I totalled those up to come to &euro;1.145 billion in rent supplements estimated for this year, if one takes that the figure for rent supplements from the Department of Social Protection will be similar.

I recall very well when rent supplements were first brought in.  It was a temporary interim measure until people got social housing or bought a house or an affordable house at the time.  They were very good schemes.  The concern here is that one is looking at a situation in which one is heading for &euro;1.4 billion or &euro;1.5 billion per year in rent supplement.

Okay, Covid had an effect, but it did not close down social housing construction.  We barely hit half the target for the year.  That is a concern.  It suggests a couple of things.  One is that there are huge delays in local authority approvals.  There is also the fact that every estate has to have a separate architectural design carried out.  There is a cost there.  I know that at one time up to 7% of the cost was allowed for architectural design.  I do not want everything to look like the Soviet Union in the 1950s, but we could have a specialised design for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, four-bedroom and five-bedroom houses as well as for single storey, two storey, disabled access, wheelchair access and so forth.  We should be able to move to a situation where we are not starting with a blank canvas.  I am just making that point.

The figure of 28% is on the basis of figures given.  They are received, the Comptroller and Auditor General looks at them and you look at them.  I understand that; that is what you are getting.  However, I can tell you that people who are not paying top-ups are the exception, including for constituents who are in private rented accommodation who come to my office.  I cannot remember a time when I spoke to a HAP tenant who is not paying a top-up.  I am saying this truthfully.  I recall saying that to the former Deputy, Joan Burton, in the D&aacute;il seven years ago.  That has accelerated and the gap is widening for the top-up.  I welcome the fact that there is discretion there of 20% and 50% where there is a risk of homelessness, but we are chasing accelerating rents.  We saw the rent figures last week from Daft.ie.  That is just one of the indicators.  The true figures for the cost of rent are not being shown in official figures because what tenants are paying is far in excess of that.  What is the legal situation regarding these top-ups?<\/p>  <p>  My understanding, and perhaps I was naive at the time, is that if landlords got into the HAP scheme, they could not charge top-ups, but they are crucifying people.  There is a human side to this.  The human side is that tenants, people who are working, are paying over half their wages in rent.  They are absolutely crucified.  It is tormenting them and it is breaking them financially and emotionally.  It is breaking up relationships.  I have seen it.  Every other Deputy here and county councillors around the country will tell the same story.  What is happening is serious.  It is a very difficult situation.  We have to use private rented accommodation, and I accept that we are trying to move away from it and the sooner, the better.  I understand that it is a chicken and egg situation and that we have to deal with the real world, but the faster we can provide housing, the better.  Meanwhile, we have to do something about that situation.  It is very important.<\/p>  <p>  That 28% is not real.  In my experience, at least 95% of the tenants I meet are paying top-ups, and substantial top-ups, along with paying the rent to the council.  They pay what is called the differential rent to the council, in other words the same rent as if one is in a council house, be it &euro;50, &euro;60, &euro;70, &euro;80 or &euro;100 per week.  That is fine; they are more than happy to do that.  However, they do not have security of tenure and, as was mentioned earlier, if they complain about the condition of the place or the like, there is no mechanism to deal with that.  In addition, they are paying the under-the-counter payment to the landlord and there is no control.  Nobody has a handle on this.  This has gone wild, and no words that I can say to you this morning can emphasise it.  The reason I feel so strongly about it is that I am meeting people who are absolutely broken in every way.  I want to convey that to the officials here.  I have said it to Ministers.  I know you are handed a policy and you have to implement it, but I want to convey to you that we are dealing with a crisis here for people and it is having an effect.  People talk about Covid-19 and mental health, but one of the biggest drivers of the mental health crisis is financial torment.  I emphasise that to you.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I wish to raise relates to the emergency accommodation.  That figure of &euro;270 million spent on it in 2021 is substantial.  I see that it is revised downwards.  How much oversight does the Department have of the tendering process for that and the procurement?

A small builder who has a crew on the ground and opportunities to scale up, bring in a local workforce and train people to work in building should have just as much of a chance to get involved in trying to solve the housing crisis as large developers.  That is something the Department should put a degree of focus on in the next 12 months.  Small builders have a role to play, but they are being locked out of the market.  Effectively, it would be common for a small or medium-sized rural builder involved in one-off housing construction in rural areas to complete 20 dwellings in a year.

There are huge risks involved in that because they may go bust or liquidity issues may arise in the middle of a build and the building contractor can be left high and dry, often accruing enormous debt.  If they are building hundreds of housing units, there could be millions of euro involved.

I had a case recently involving somebody with a physical disability where the requirement for their accommodation differed from that of an able-bodied person.  Therefore, the discretion was not sufficient to secure a property they required.  In the review the Department is doing, I ask it to consider that element.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's report found that 28% of HAP tenants were making the top-up payment in the first half of 2019.  I do not expect witnesses have the figures today but they might send a note to the committee with figures for 2017 through to 2020 on the top-ups.  The examination found the Department did not have information on the proportion of proposed HAP tenancies inspected or the results of those inspections.

A lot of the social housing stock is new build, which is built to BER rating 2.  Offhand, I think that is another 25,000 houses.  Quite a proportion of the stock has had some level of retrofit.  The challenge is deep retrofits across 36,000 units over the coming years.  We are trying to gear-up towards that.  In the last year about 800 or 900 were done.  There was a significant reluctance among people within the homes to get into that during Covid.  That was not really the issue, which was more that of the restrictions.

I will ask about the thresholds for social housing.  One's income has to be under a certain level before one can go on the social housing waiting list.  Those figures, as I recall, have not been reviewed since 2011.  Different people, including Ministers, told me as far back as two years ago that a review was happening.  There are some answers to parliamentary questions submitted by me and others on this issue.  There is a problem there at the moment.  Let us take the rural counties of Laois and Offaly as an example.  The threshold is &euro;480 for a single person.  If one's income is &euro;2 or &euro;3 over that threshold, one cannot apply for social housing.  The threshold for a couple with three children is &euro;536, from memory.  If such a family has an income of &euro;537, &euro;538 or &euro;539, that family of five cannot get on the housing waiting list.  We have arrived at a situation where a labourer, a general worker on the county council, and his or her family, cannot get on the social housing waiting list.  Cleaners cannot get on the social housing waiting list.  People who are working as labourers on building sites cannot get on the waiting list.  People who are working as domestics in kitchens or as home helps cannot get on the waiting list.  The lowest paid workers in the State cannot get on the waiting list.  That is the situation we have arrived at.  Of course, they cannot get a mortgage either.  I earlier mentioned people who are receiving HAP but there is a cohort of tens of thousands of people beyond the walls of this building who are in private rented accommodation and working but have not a hope in hell of getting a mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  I accept and acknowledge that the new local authority loan is better than that under Rebuilding Ireland.  There have been a number of improvements and I acknowledge that.  However, the people I am talking about do not have a hope of being able to get that because their income is not at a point to entitle them to it.  There is no point in them going to a bank or building society or any kind of a private lending institution.  They have no hope.  I know people who are paying half their income on rent.  Half of the &euro;390 they earn is going on rent.  Some of them are in the HAP scheme but some of them are not.  Some are earning &euro;410 or &euro;420 and are paying more than half their income on rent.  I regularly come across that situation, as I am sure others do as well.  We must do something.<\/p>  <p>  This review has long been promised.  When are those income thresholds going to be increased?

I could use words to describe that but everyone will know what I mean by this.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest we bring to the attention of the Secretary General that the answer in point No. 6 is at odds with what was stated.  As I said, I am open to correction.  The rest of you were in the room here that day as well.  Things get said at meetings, back and forth.  When you are chairing, in particular, you can miss something that is going on between a member and the witnesses.  As I recall it, that day the Secretary General said they took the decision.  The Secretary General was pressed on that a number of times and, at one particular instance, said that.  I ask that we would clarify that, maybe, if it can be, from the recordings, point out to the Secretary General there seems to be a discrepancy in what happened in the room here and what is in that, and ask if that is the case.  I am open to correction.  If I am wrong on it, I am wrong on it.<\/p>  <p>  The other point, that is raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy in relation to point No. 5, is about there being the same legal team.  I propose we raise that issue.  There is also the issue at point No. 10, in relation to the sanctions.  Does that cover everything that Deputy Carthy had?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700022#HH01400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1645101000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700022#HH01500","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1645101000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>We will look for that.<\/p>  <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. R1049.

The first was the inability of the RT&Eacute; representatives to provide us with the information on the percentage of their income that is being spent on their top earners, despite the fact that they had given an undertaking to us to do precisely that.  This illustrates RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s typical approach to this committee over the past 17 months.  In light of that, would it be possible to ask RT&Eacute; to provide figures as to the amount earned by their top ten earners in the years from 2019 to date?  I understand that the latest figures still have not been published.  Could we also ask them for the number of people who are earning in excess of &euro;150,000 annually, as well as the total outlay for these, from 2019 to date?  We might be able to try and get ourselves, given that they are reluctant to furnish us with it, despite giving an undertaking to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Second, can we seek clarity on whether the RT&Eacute; Player is developed or maintained internally or it is an off-the-shelf product, as well as on how much the organisation has spent on either purchasing the player, or development and maintenance per year since its inception?

No. 1078 B is correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Health, dated 16 February 2022, providing information requested by the committee regarding the temporary assistance payment scheme and the 2020 Supplementary Estimate for Vote 38 - Health.  The Secretary General states that two Supplementary Estimates were approved in 2020, amounting to over &euro;2 billion.  These primarily related to Covid-19 expenditure and the 2020-21 winter plan.  The funding was mainly allocated to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The governance and oversight arrangements are set out in the correspondence as well as a breakdown of the expenditure, although there are inconsistencies between the Department's cash-based system and the HSE's accruals based financial performance report.  In respect of the temporary assistance payment scheme, which was established to support private and voluntary nursing homes with additional costs due to Covid-19, the Department states that \"a robust control framework was put in place\".

The database concerned the non-profit sector, which is reported to receive about &euro;7 billion in public funds each year.  While the response sets out a clear rationale for the termination of the database, I think there is a strong argument that it is in the public interest to maintain this database.  Members will recall that Deputy Catherine Murphy raised this time-sensitive matter at our meeting of 3 February.

It was a very useful database that was open source and widely used.  This was terminated at very short notice.  It has been reported that the people operating it basically found out by way of an FOI request that was subsequently published in one of the newspapers.  According to the Department's response, it was a Pathfinder project.  What does that mean?  I think we need to go back to the Department and find out exactly what it means.<\/p>  <p>  There are something like 12,000 charities in the country, some of which are schools, sports clubs and charities in the traditional meaning of the word.  Some of it is for tax purposes but some of those sports clubs would not be charities.  This database would have gathered a significant amount of information and was very open and transparent.  If anything, it provided a level playing pitch in terms of the not-for-profits in that the information was available and they did not have to buy-in expensive consultants to do pieces of work but could do some of the work themselves based on the information that was available.  I think it is a significant loss.  There was significant public investment in it.<\/p>  <p>  It does not appear as if any successor initiative is ready to go so this database will be lost.  Every day, you lose a database you are not populating means your database is out of date or you must go back and fill it.

Do we know the timeline involved in that?  I cannot get over the range of individuals and entities that use this database.  Since I started raising the matter, I have received quite a lot of communication relating to it.  The Benefacts people were treated deplorably.  If something can be cut off at very short notice, it does nothing to build confidence in sectors.<\/p>  <p>  There appears to be an absence of any kind of dialogue.  Maybe I am misunderstanding that.  Maybe we should ask the Department whether dialogue took place or whether that was a misrepresentation in the papers.  I would like to know what dialogue took place with the Department in advance of that and what engagement the Department had with the Department of Rural and Community Development, which I understand is the Department that will be required to develop an alternative option.

No. 1033C from Deputy Jennifer Carroll McNeill, dated 27 January 2022, forwards correspondence on behalf of Neurodiversity Sandymount.  It concerns HSE structures and funding for autistic children and related Department of Education expenditure for transporting children to avail of services.  The correspondence states that transporting children on buses and taxis is costing in the region of &euro;72,000 per day.  Deputies Andrews and Dillon have also forwarded this correspondence to the committee, which is numbered R1037 and R1045, respectively.  The correspondent calls on the committee to engage with the relevant Ministers but as the Ministers are not accountable to this committee, it is proposed to advise the correspondent that she might also wish to bring the matter to the attention of the committee on education as the Ministers referenced are accountable to that committee.  I also suggest we write to the HSE and the Department of Education to query whether value for money is being achieved here and ask what steps are being taken to address the issues raised in the correspondence.  Subject to that response, it is also a matter we could add to the agenda for our meeting with the HSE on 10 March.  I would appreciate Members' input here.  Deputy Munster has raised this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700025#LL01800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1645102800,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

Obviously, I and my office are taking this very seriously.  I wish to inform the committee that, as yet, we have only preliminary information about what adjustment may be proposed by the HSE.  The draft annual financial statements for 2021 are currently being prepared by the HSE and, as is required, will in due course be considered by the HSE's audit and risk committee.  We expect to receive the draft financial statements by 28 February, which is the normal date we receive them.  If a prior year adjustment is proposed by the HSE, we will expect to receive detailed backup information from the HSE to support that adjustment.  We will then complete the final audit, including a full review of the proposed adjustment, within the statutory timeframe.  The HSE's financial statements have to be certified by 21 May.  We will look to see that any adjustment required is properly accounted for and, particularly, that the reasons for it are adequately explained in the notes to the financial statements.  We would expect such notes to explain why the errors occurred, why the existing controls did not pick them up and prevent them and what the HSE has done to ensure they do not recur.

I do not see anything in what has been reported about the potential prior year adjustment to suggest that it is related to any material loss of public funds.

I believe the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s approach is the correct one.  It is in the public interest and is a matter of public concern that warrants a hearing of this committee with both the HSE and the Department of Health officials in place.  There have been long-standing concerns with regard to the effectiveness of health spending and whether it delivers the type of services that would be warranted for the amount that is invested by taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  The matters that arose from the media reports at the weekend were of sufficient public concern to warrant the remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor General at the outset and a firm commitment from this committee that we will be pursuing them.  I agree it would be appropriate that we wait until the Comptroller and Auditor General has the full information so that we can be confident about any questions we may want to put to either body before we arrange that meeting.  In the shorter term I suggest we write to both bodies seeking their responses to the issues that have been raised at this point in order that they can put their own reflections on all of this to the committee and we can start assessing our responses to that.  I do not know if the Chairman has mentioned doing this.  I welcome the clarification from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is very useful for us to have an understanding of how this process works from his perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700027#NN00800","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1645104000,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Following directly on Deputies Carthy and Murphy, there is very significant public concern about the issues raised in that newspaper article and these are at the core of what the Committee of Public Accounts is about.  I fully accept the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General that there is no perceived loss of money at this point, although he reserves the right to examine that.  There is also the concern that while money should be made available, it should not be tied up within one particular stream of funding where it cannot be spent and is unavailable for other uses.<\/p>  <p>  The concern I have, and it is very serious one for every Member of the Oireachtas, is that there may be an attempt here to undermine the very democratic will of this Oireachtas to allocate funding and to set a priority on this particular issue of mental health.  This is reporting by the media so I cannot yet say if this is true or untrue but the Department of Health has an obligation to follow through on the political decisions taken by Oireachtas.  If a Minister or Minister of State of the Government allocates funding that can be spent in that one year, the public and the people who use mental health services would expect every effort to be made to ensure that money is spent along the lines the Government has outlined.  How decisions are made in this place, administered and implemented is very important for everybody in the Oireachtas.  If there is a suggestion there is an unwillingness to do that or it is being frustrated in any way, that is something the Committee of Public Accounts needs to get to the bottom of.  I have heard the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, speak very passionately in the media about this issue and she is very clear that all the money she sought was money the HSE could spend.  I know the Deputy very well and know she champions this issue of mental health.  She has her sleeves rolled up on this.  We must ensure that if funds are secured, they are spent.  That is an issue I certainly want to get to the bottom of in any session we have with the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700027#NN01000","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1645104000,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I wish ask the Chairman if he believes the issue of recruitment is a particular aspect-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700027#NN01100","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1645104000,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Five or six issues have been raised publicly across this when you look at it.  Mental health is one aspect of it.  I am concerned that where some of us have argued for more money for health, the Oireachtas decides on a Vote for this and the Minister allocates the money, if that money goes to the Department of Health and there is an issue that means the money cannot be put to into effect by the HSE for some reason or other or due to whatever blockage is there, and we can speculate as to the reasons for this, that is not acceptable.  If there are barriers, that is a different thing.  Is it a barrier or is it a blockage?<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of areas in regard to enhanced community care, nursing homes, the reconciliation of pay, budget numbers and recruitment, and serious issues have been raised around that.  We have mentioned public nursing homes.  At this point we are in the position to ask the secretariat to put these matters to both the HSE and the Department of Health to get their responses to the articles and issues we have raised at the committee.  As to how that happens is another day&rsquo;s work, but we are concerned about the issues.<\/p>  <p>  This cuts right to the middle of what this committee is about, and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s advice and information is useful in that when he is in a position, we can organise a hearing on this.  This is something we need to get to the bottom of.  The members have heard me giving out on many occasions about the fact we have &euro;22 billion of a health budget and, for whatever reason, we cannot get services.  This cuts to the heart of whatever is going on in respect of these issues.  Perhaps there are steps that have been taken to address these issues.  I hate to report it but we have gone into a number of issues such as dental health, the school dental schemes and audiology services.  I can rattle these off, as I am sure can other members.  A good budget has been allocated, and if we had more funding, we would put it in because of the importance of health.  We allocate the budgets and argue back and forth about that in this House, which is democracy.  At the end of the day, however, we all recognise there has been a good budget this year but we have not been able to translate that into services at the other end.  We do not know the full extent in respect of the issues raised, which is why we need to get replies from both bodies on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  This cuts to the heart of this issue and I look forward to the Secretary General of the Department of Health addressing this issue directly.  In fairness, I believe it has been reported that he may have suggested some of these resources have been diverted into waiting lists.  One person I believe suggested that would happen.  That is fair enough but this shows we can allocate money but the service does not happen at the other end.  Recruitment is a problem.  Is there a problem on workforce planning and training?  Certainly, some of the issues that have come up at this committee and which came up again when we had Tusla before the committee concern the question whether we are training people for these positions.<\/p> <p>What is the problem?  Are they emigrating?  Are they not being offered proper contracts?  Are they being offered short-term contracts, maybe for six months or 12 months, but can go to Australia or Canada and get a permanent post?  I do not know the answers to those questions.  It would be worthwhile to raise those questions publicly with both Departments to see whether they can reply to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700027#NN01200","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645104600,"counter":573,"content":"<p>For clarity in respect of how we proceed on this, we know we are waiting for the accounts to be signed off and, realistically, it will be mid-year or maybe quarter 3.

We are talking about dealing with those issues earlier than the issue in respect of the accounts and the prospect of there being a prior adjustment.  That is later in the year.  We are talking about hopefully having a second session in addition to the piece on mental health we will be doing in a few weeks.

We have to be fair.  There is no point in bringing in a body that is ill-prepared or doing so if we do not have our part of it together.

As the Chairman stated, some of this has to do with workforce planning, training and possibly the type of contracts on offer and so on.  Every year when we look at the accounts, one can see the full amount that was allocated in respect of workforce, for example, is not taken up.  The announcement is made in the budget but then it takes time to recruit staff.  Although you could account for the full amount from January to December, realistically they do not all get employed immediately.  I refer to that particular aspect about what is the capacity and what are the issues in respect of spending money.  Value for money is not just about the decision to spend a particular amount and it all being properly accounted for; it is about what we get for it.  That comes down to the services, the postcode lottery and many other things that come into play.  To my mind, that particular aspect keeps coming up every year.  The problem with the HSE is you could have it in here every week for the next year and we still would not get through the issues.  It is a very big amount of money and sometimes one has to do fairly distinctive pieces.  I hope we will be able to do that well in advance of the work the Comptroller and Auditor General is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700028#OO00600","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1645104600,"counter":578,"content":"<p>The Deputy is suggesting the committee have a session on that issue on its own, possibly on 24 March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022021700028#OO00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1645104600,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Yes, or on another date.

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Before we hear from the witness, I propose we publish his opening statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On behalf of the committee I extend a warm welcome to the Press Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Feeney.  This committee has an oversight role over all ombudsmen and this is the first time the Press Ombudsman has appeared before us.  The Office of the Press Ombudsman was established in 2008 and in 2010 SI 163 was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, recognising the Press Council and the Press Ombudsman.  The Defamation Act 2009 states the principal objectives of the Press Council shall be to ensure the protection of freedom of expression of the press; the protection of the public interest by ensuring ethical, accurate and truthful reporting by the press; the maintenance of certain minimum ethical and professional standards among the press; and to ensure the privacy and dignity of the individual is protected.  The world has changed since 2009 and there are difficulties with the regulation of social media.  The online safety and media regulation Bill 2022 will, we hope, address some of these matters.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Feeney is no stranger to us and before becoming Press Ombudsman, he had considerable experience in public service broadcasting as editor of current affairs television at RT&Eacute;.  Before that he lectured in politics at the University of Ulster.<\/p><p>I suggest the Press Ombudsman makes his opening statement for ten minutes and we will then have some questions and comments from members.  We ask each member to keep their time for questions and answers to five minutes and this will allow for members to come back in on a couple of occasions.<\/p><p> I invite Mr. Feeney, Press Ombudsman, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#A01700","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies and Senators for this opportunity to make an opening statement to the committee.<br\/><br\/>The Office of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council of Ireland were established in 2008, as the Chairman has said.  It was an initiative of the newspaper industry, which recognised that trust in the content of newspapers required an independent means whereby the public could hold to account editors and journalists.  After a detailed examination of newspaper regulatory structures in other European countries, a structure was developed for Ireland.  It was seen from the very beginning that, for any structure put in place to have credibility, it would have to be independent of the press industry and of government.  It was necessary to have independent public interest members who were not associated with the press.  The Press Council has 13 members.  The majority of seven are independent members and the other six members are nominated by national and local newspapers, magazines and the National Union of Journalists, which may nominate one member.<br\/><br\/>Also established in 2008 was the Office of the Press Ombudsman.  The Press Ombudsman would be the first port of call for members of the public seeking redress.  A code of practice was drawn up by editors.  If a member of the public felt something published in a member publication breached any of the principles of the code of practice, he or she could make a complaint to the Press Ombudsman.  I should emphasise that the decision-making function of the Press Ombudsman is entirely independent of the Press Council of Ireland.  This is as it should be because my decisions as the Press Ombudsman can be, under limited circumstances, appealed to the full Press Council.<br\/><br\/>Unlike all other ombudsman services, the Press Ombudsman is not based on statute and we are not a statutory body.  We are independent of government.  However, as the Chairman has said, for the purposes of the Defamation Act 2009, the Press Council of Ireland is recognised as meeting the criteria necessary.  A ministerial order signed in 2010 confers certain advantages on the Press Ombudsman.  A significant benefit was that qualified privilege attaches to all reports of the Press Ombudsman and Press Council.  Subscription to the Press Council and adherence to the code of practice also strengthens the entitlement of member publications to avail of the defence of reasonable publication in any court action.<br\/><br\/>The Press Ombudsman began receiving complaints in 2008.  Since that date we have dealt with more than 5,000 complaints.  Our emphasis initially is always on conciliation and trying to find a means of resolving complaints.  This may mean a newspaper publishing a correction or clarification, it may publish a letter, or it may edit the online record or whatever.  As part of the conciliation service we also provide a more formal mediation service for complainants and editors.  Many complaints are resolved at conciliation.  If conciliation is not possible, a complaint goes to me as the Press Ombudsman.  If the Press Ombudsman judges that there has been a breach of the code, my decision must be published in full on the same page or further forward in the newspaper, and without any editorial comment.  The only exception to this is if publication of the article is on the front page of a newspaper.  In this case my decision must be published on one of the first four pages of the newspaper.<br\/><br\/>If either the complainant or the newspaper is not satisfied with my decision, the decision may be appealed, on a limited number of grounds, to the full Press Council.  The Press Council then hears the appeal, and if the original decision of the Press Ombudsman upholding the complaint is affirmed, the publication must publish my original decision and the appeal outcome of the Press Council.<br\/><br\/>Membership of the Press Council is voluntary.  In other words, no publication has to join the Press Council.  I am happy to say all national newspapers - print and online editions - including Irish editions of UK newspapers, the majority of local newspapers, as well as many magazines have joined the Press Council.  In addition, with the growth of online-only news publications, there are now many online-only members of the Press Council, with <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>as an obvious example.<br\/><br\/>In summary, the vast majority of journalism found in newspapers, magazines and online in Ireland is now subject to the independent complaints handling processes of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council.  We pride ourselves on the speed with which complaints are dealt with.  Typically from publication to a decision takes on average between six and eight weeks.  If a complaint can be resolved at conciliation, the timeframe can be much shorter.  For many people a speedy resolution to a complaint is the most important aspect of the complaints process.  Senators and Deputies will be aware the alternative of pursuing an issue through the defamation process is very slow, very expensive and very time consuming.  Typically, it can take two to five years for a defamation action to reach the courts.<br\/><br\/>After 15 years of operation what can we say?  The number of complaints we receive each year suggests the public recognises the worth of the complaints process.  It suggests that the public buys into the independence and value of the process.  For the press, it can be said that publications have always fully engaged with the Office of the Press Ombudsman and have committed themselves to engaging in the conciliation process.  The code of practice, which is subject to occasional review, has stood up well as a defender in the press, especially the rights of privacy, protection of children, the rights of accuracy, and the avoidance of prejudice.<br\/><br\/>It is my view the Irish public is well served by its newspapers, both national and local, as well as online-only news services as vehicles for information, comment and debate.  The excesses found in the media in other countries are not found in Ireland to the same extent.  In my view, the press in Ireland provides an important role in keeping the public well and accurately informed and plays an essential role in Ireland's democratic process.  I would say this has been made clear in the past two years of Covid.  The role the press has played in keeping the public well-informed with accurate information and measured debate has played a significant part in the way this country has faced the challenges of the past two years.<br\/><br\/>Of course, there are issues and problems.  Public discourse has moved, in part, from traditional media of print and broadcasting to social media.  This is largely an unregulated area and has led to a huge growth in misinformation, aggression and vitriol.  As any politician can testify, this has tarnished public debate and allowed unsubstantiated comment, a status not found before.  The Press Council welcomes Government proposals for the introduction of an online safety commissioner and a media authority as important parts in holding to account and regulating social media.  No one can dispute the value social media has brought in opening means of communication and debate, but we must recognise simultaneously that social media can bring harm, and it is important to put in place structures to deal with it.  Getting the balance right between defending freedom of expression and avoiding harm is not easy.  In the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, it is to be presumed we will see much of that debate.<br\/><br\/>The new media authority will bring together broadcasting and social media and recognise the changes that have taken place in the media over the past two decades.  The Government proposals for the new media authority do not include the areas of the media that are covered by the Press Council.  We welcome this distinction and see it as a recognition that current structures that apply to newspapers, magazines and online news services are working efficiently and have unique qualities that are best nurtured by the independent structures we have in place.<br\/><br\/>One of the main issues facing the print media today is the growth in dominance of social media and its distortion of the marketplace.  As an example, about 85% of online media advertising spend in Ireland is directed to the major international social media organisations.  This leaves the indigenous media such as online editions of newspapers and online-only services fighting over the last 15% of the available online advertising revenue.  This has led to a direct result in a loss of jobs and a loss of journalists and fewer resources for newspapers to carry out their roles as the Fourth Estate.  We can see this at local level where regional newspapers have fewer resources to report on local government matters and local court matters.  Local communities rely on their local newspapers for critical information and debate on issues that count for them.  The Government established a Future of Media Commission. This commission has concluded its report, which has gone to the Government.  The Press Council urges the Government to publish that report and to implement as many of its recommendations as possible.<br\/><br\/>Another cause of concern is that the Government has not met the commitment in the 2009 Act that after five years there would be a review of the efficacy and usefulness of the Defamation Act.  That review is now long overdue.  It is hoped that the review may make recommendations in terms of the level of awards given in defamation actions.<\/p><p>No one doubts the importance of citizens being able to protect their reputations by using the defamation process but if the level of awards is so high as to threaten the financial future of the press industry and to act as a censorial hand on legitimate investigative journalism, then surely the balance is not right and needs to be addressed.  One specific recommendation which the Press Council of Ireland has made to this review which was made several years ago, is that solicitors in advising their clients who are considering taking defamation actions should be legally obliged to inform their clients of the services of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council of Ireland.  The level of legal costs in defamation actions in Ireland is out of line with other countries and is a major burden on the press.  Recourse to the services of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council may ease some of that burden. <\/p><p> A final point, as ombudsman I do not have the power to initiate complaints.  My office responds to complaints we receive.  We also only accept complaints about individual articles, not general claims about the press.  Complaints can only be considered about something that has been published in the last three months and complainants must be able to demonstrate that they have been personally affected by what has been published.  <\/p><p> I am available to answer any questions members may have.  The only limitation is that I cannot discuss individual complaints or their outcome or indeed reasoning behind any specific decisions.  Section 6(1)(8) of the report of the committee on the review of the terms of reference for the Joint Committee on Public Petitions makes this clear. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Feeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Feeney.  The freedom of the press is of vital importance to the proper functioning of any democracy for the enhancement of critical thinking, the exchange of ideas and to hold those in positions of privilege and power to account.  What we have seen throughout the pandemic is local publications in all our areas that have gotten into trouble.  They have  had to temporarily lay off some very good journalists.  Hopefully as we come out of the pandemic that can be reversed.  More widely we have seen, and it is in Mr. Feeney's opening statement, the influence of social media both in terms of its contribution and the detraction from the quality of public debate and its ability to cause harm with immediate consequences.  I will raise two issues before I let the other members in.  Mr. Feeney is in a unique position to be the ombudsman that is operating in a private, unstatutory field, which is welcome, given the need to ensure the independence of the press.  Does he find the need to evolve with the nature of complaints that come his way?  Does the independent nature of his role enable him to make those adaptations?  The second issue is, as he stated a few minutes ago, another cause for concern is the slowness with which the Government has made a commitment to a review after five years of the Defamation Act 2009.  Does he think this should be reviewed sooner, but also to include social media?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#C00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":612,"content":"<p>The first point is that I think the relationship between ombudsmen in general and the Government is now at a good level.  In other words politicians take the decisions of ombudsmen seriously and see the value for ordinary citizens in there being good ombudsmen services across financial services, children, language, and so forth.  The relationship in general between all the ombudsmen and Government is now in quite a healthy state.  Obviously in the early days the public confidence in ombudsmen's independence had to grow.  Now, 20 or 30 years later, we have had excellent ombudsmen, information commissioners and excellent people in financial services and in the Garda, etc.  There is now a good balance between the independence of ombudsmen and the attention that Government pays to them.  Ombudsmen are very pleased that the joint committee is now taking ombudsmen under its umbrella because that helps us to get across the issues which we see as important and need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In other ombudsmen's annual reports I have seen several examples where citizens who have been denied their rights have got those rights addressed and have found justice through the operation of the ombudsman services.  Our independence from Government is actually not a particularly critical disadvantage or advantage for us.  It is more to do with the tradition of newspapers being independent of Government.  As members know from the very beginning broadcasting was always subject to Government but newspapers were not.  It is more for historical reasons that is there.  <\/p> <p>  The second question is about the review.  As Press Ombudsman and Press Council, we do not have any huge issue with our current structures.  I do not want to sound complacent but we are actually quite happy with the structures that exist at present.  However we are concerned that newspapers, which we think play an important role, are under very severe financial pressure.  The Chair mentioned lay-offs.  My understanding is that many local newspapers, in particular, have relied on pandemic employment schemes to fund their journalists over the past two years and that this obviously has come to an end.  There is a concern in the industry that the jobs of some of those journalists may be at risk when they have to get paid out of reduced advertising revenue.  The key point really is advertising revenue.  I would make the point that much of the readership lost through the loss of sales of newspapers has been compensated for by increased accessing of online news.  My view, and it is only my view, is that the way in which people absorb journalism works much better in print than online.  If it is a lengthy investigative piece it is much easier to read that in a newspaper or magazine than it is to read it on a phone.  Much of the use of mobile devices for access to journalism is to do with entertainment journalism and for goal scores and so forth.  There is much less of the old fourth estate position of really looking into things and holding to account.  That works better in print.  I am hopeful that the Government will consider the proposals of the new media commission and that when the review of the Defamation Act 2009 takes place, it will put into place effect measures that will strengthen the role and value of media in Ireland. <\/p> <p>  As we all know, we share a language with a much larger dominant neighbour.  In regard to television viewing and newspaper reading, public discourse in Ireland will lose out if the dominant source moves from being Irish sources to British sources.  We can see this with Brexit.  We can see this attitude today in cultural policy and the European agricultural policy over the years.  It is terribly important that there is an Irish media which addresses Irish concerns with an Irish understanding of them.  If we were to rely on our neighbours we would have, from our perspective, an understanding which I think would disadvantage us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Feeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I thank the ombudsman for his time and his comprehensive opening statement.  I was particularly interested to hear about the service his office provides in terms of addressing individual complaints, and his comments in regard to the ability of social media to, as he put it, tarnish debates.  I am keen to understand his perspective on the online safety and media regulation Bill and, in particular, its approach to individual complaints.  I know from the victims of online abuse of exploitation and bullying and the organisations that represent them, such as BodyWhys, CyberSafeKids, SpunOut, Jigsaw and many more, that while the online safety and media regulation Bill is a welcome and progressive step, that many organisations working on the ground feel that a mechanism for individual complaints is necessary, and I support them in this.  I agreed with Mr. Feeney when he said recently that going through a social media platform to have your complaint dealt with can often be difficult and lengthy.  It can feel like the social media companies must be drowning in such a huge number of complaints that they just cannot keep up with.  That is further supported by the recent whistleblower claims from the former Facebook employee, Frances Haugen, who claims that Facebook and Instagram actively encourage and promote negative and abusive content because those posts sell more, get more clicks and garner more attention.  I would be very interested to know Mr. Feeney's views on an individual complaints mechanism for social media and how he thinks that could be implemented.<\/p> <p>  Recently I have also been looking at how we might include overly edited or photo-shopped media advertisements in the definition of harmful content.  I would be keen to understand whether this is something he thinks there is room to provide for in print media as well.  I believe there is provision to further define categories of harmful content beyond the current definition of cyberbullying that may look at other things as well as self-harm and eating disorders.  I would be keen to hear if he had any views on how we could expand that definition and the parameters.  I say that in the context of the online safety and media regulation Bill but I think there is an opportunity for print media too.  He spoke about the differences in terms of journalism, advertisement, investment and regulation between print media and online platforms, and the vulnerability of print journalism to modern technological developments.<\/p><p> All members of this committee know the value of online political activity.  A boosted post can reach as many constituents as a leaflet drop.  A targeted advertisement can reach the exact audience we want to pinpoint.  We can share information ourselves even where a journalist deems it not newsworthy or, indeed, not accurate.  Platforms like Facebook and Instagram have replaced the platforms that politicians used to stand on outside the church gates.  The power of politicians' message is not just what they say but how many times people share it and how much that narrative is amplified.  That is how we get our message out and how all of us try to influence democracy.  We saw the fantastic benefits of that with online movements like #HomeToVote, which amplified social movements like repeal the eighth and the marriage equality referendum.  <\/p><p> That is the benefit of social media but there are, as alluded to by the Ombudsman, also great threats, including to democracy, because social media allows for such easy and viral spreading of disinformation.  It also allows for the generation of online hate messages and bots that are created solely for political gain.  As Mr. Feeney said, social media is not subject to the same regulation as the print media industry.  It is clear that we need additional investment in how we tackle that.  It is not good enough to mandate social media platforms to remove content.  We need to implement fines to ensure that actually happens.  While that is part of what the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is about, does that legislation go far enough?<\/p><p> Democracy is fragile.  We saw that when supporters of President Trump, egged on by his tweets, stormed Capitol Hill.  Allowing social media to become a weapon, which we certainly do not allow in the case of the print media, poses a threat.  I am very interested in hearing Mr. Feeney's views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#C00400","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Higgins who covered a wide area.  I will address some of her points.<br\/><br\/>The Government proposal to introduce some form of regulation of social media is a vital and necessary measure.  There is a recognition in the proposals in the Bill that it is not possible to moderate social media in advance of publication.  In other words, because there are millions of postings on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok, etc., every hour, it is simply inconceivable that all of those could go through some sort of moderation process first.  The key question, as mentioned by Deputy Higgins, is how do these social media companies address complaints.  In the first instance, can a member of the public complain easily?  Second, if someone can complain, can that complaint be addressed quickly because tweets and messages need to be taken down if they are threatening, offensive, damaging or whatever else they may happen to be?  In my view, the major social media companies have put in place some structures for dealing with complaints but they are not at all user-friendly for the ordinary citizen.  For example, there is no telephone number for ringing up Facebook.  I can send a message to but that is as likely to be opened in California as it is in Dublin.  How will the person who answers that be able to understand the nuances of Irish politics to make a decision on how important that message is?  <br\/><br\/>The Government proposal must concentrate on ensuring that all social media companies have in place proper, effective mechanisms to deal with complaints and take down material.  They need to be fined if they do not do that and the fines need to be seven figure sums.  There is no point in fining Facebook &euro;100,000.  That is coffee money.  These companies need to be fined millions if they are in breach.  They have already accepted the need for regulation so the door is, to a certain extent, ajar.<br\/><br\/>It is absolutely necessary that the new proposals provide that if Facebook, etc., do not take down material and respond quickly and effectively and have mechanisms in place to deal with this, they should be punished and fined.  These companies do not lack the resources to do this.  They are hugely successful commercial operations that have the resources to put effective mechanisms in place to deal with complaints.  Of course, there will be accusations of censorship and that people&rsquo;s opinions are being suppressed but people with experience and good judgment should be capable of looking at something and saying that it is just an expression of a viewpoint and is not harmful.<br\/><br\/>These companies use algorithms at the moment to deal with many issues.  Algorithms will address the taking out of language which is unacceptable and may address issues like the amount of naked body flesh visible on a screen but they cannot deal with the subtleties of many complaints.  We receive quite a few phone calls into our office from people saying they have an issue with Facebook.  We explain that we cannot help them because Facebook does not come under our remit and we talk through them through how they can complain to Facebook.  Most people feel this is a terrible David and Goliath situation and almost impossible to deal with.  <br\/><br\/>The Government is on the right lines and I am hoping this Bill will become an Act fairly soon.  It will have to be reviewed because, inevitably, devices will be found to get around or minimise its impact on the commercial model of social media companies.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy raised the important issue of photo-shopping.  Advertising does not come within our remit.  The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland is an independent body but my understanding is that the new media authority of Ireland will incorporate advertising.  That is to be welcomed because it will mean there will be a statutory body looking after advertising in the future.  Issues such as body-shaming could well be included in guidelines or actual regulations because it would not be that difficult to do that.  We all recognise that advertising would not exist if it was not effective.  If it is effective, we have to look at both its good and bad messages.  If it has bad messages, there should be a means of dealing with that.  <br\/><br\/>The Deputy made a about journalists.  It is inevitable that the majority of journalism going forward will be accessed via online versions.  The future of print newspapers and magazines is going to be quite difficult.  I am hoping that journalism will continue but that it will be predominantly online in the future.  We can see evidence of that in other countries where newspapers have simply ceased having a print edition and have gone online only.  There are obvious commercial issues to be taken into account and my own view is that there will be a loss.  Accepting that this is probably inevitable, it is very important that every single Irish regional newspaper now has some online presence.  There is a terrible balance to be struck.<br\/><br\/>The regional newspaper with which I am most familiar is the<i>Southern Star<\/i>because I spend a great deal of time in west Cork.  The <i>Southern Star<\/i>is a very good local newspaper.  It has an online addition but if it puts too much up on its online addition, there is no incentive for the public to buy its print edition.  If no one buys its print edition, it will not have resources.  There is, therefore, a balance to be struck.  The newspaper will put up four to five stories on its online edition and the rest of the newspaper will then be found in the version that is purchased each week in a local supermarket.<br\/><br\/>Going forward, given that online journalism is transnational, Irish media will need assistance.  <i>The Journal <\/i>is a good example of that. <i><\/i>It is a good, reputable online-only news operation, which provides good and accurate information to people who use it and space for debate and comment, etc.  One of the problems, however, which is very hard to address, is that the comments of readers underneath those legitimate and good journalistic articles can be very misogynistic and aggressive.<br\/><br\/>I do not know a Deputy or Senator who has not said to me over the years that the very practice of knocking on constituents' doors at election time has moved from being a relatively pleasant experience 20 years ago to becoming frequently an aggressive experience now.  In the past, when a Fianna F&aacute;il person knocked on a Fine Gael voter's door, the person would still be polite.  Deputies and Senators tell me they are often abused at doors now because people pick up on the cynical, anti-establishment tone from social media which can be very aggressive and unpleasant.  Women Members of the Oireachtas, in particular, have experienced this and are subject to what can only be described as vile abuse at times.  There is no argument but that the comments on online newspapers needs to be regulated, just as much as the whole area of comments on Facebook, Twitter, etc., needs to be regulated.  Getting that balance right will be very difficult and will not be achieved once and for all time.

I use social media.  It is my way of getting my message out as an Independent Deputy.  I work within the criteria given to me.  In respect of television appearances and the amount of time given to Government Deputies on the national broadcaster compared to Independent Deputies, it involves money generated for it.  When you invest in something, it is money generated.  Independents like me do not have the same amount of money to put into television advertisements that a Government would have.  Something we could look at would be requiring national media to give a certain amount of time to Independents to debate different issues.  This might then give people the kind of balance they see on social media.  Social media is the only platform available to me as an Independent.  I have no problem going on national television and debating any of the issues there but Independents are never given the opportunity to do so.  That is the structure that is there at the moment.  The Government has the budget to do it.  We have Oireachtas TV, which gives us a platform, but we also have the national broadcaster, into which everyone with a television licence pays.  The same people elect people to the position they hold.  Regardless of whether a Deputy is party or non-party, he or she is still elected to the 33rd D&aacute;il to represent the people of Ireland so we need to look at whether we can bring something to Government in order that the national broadcaster has to provide time and cannot use the same Independents all the time.  It needs to spread it among all Members.  This involves every Member from every party and none.<\/p> <p>  I am involved in many charity events.  Again, I use social media to help raise awareness when we are putting on an event for people in need.  It is a fantastic tool when you use it for the right reasons but it can become nasty if people use it for the wrong reasons.  It is the one reason I never reply to anyone on social media.  It is a rule I have.  If you want to talk to me, pick up the phone.  If you want to send a message with your contact details, I will contact you.  If you want to abuse me online, you are by yourself and will be looking back at yourself because I will not reply.  That is my rule.  I use social media to the best of my abilities and for all the right reasons.  I welcome the Press Ombudsman in regard to all he can do but, again, we can target online bullying ourselves by speaking out and telling people it will not be tolerated.  At the same time, we need to tell people who are being bullied online not to reply.  We call them keyboard warriors.  All they want is a reply for the rush.  People can see that the same people are jumping on the bandwagon to make people look bad.  It does not bother me - it goes over my head - but I need to help other people to see that they have the tools to deal with it in the same way.  Do not answer it.  People should ask Members of the Oireachtas to raise this matter and show the pattern that is there.  If there is a pattern and people are bullying people online, we can go to the likes of Facebook and the Press Ombudsman and tell them these people have bullied five or six people online so let us tackle that as public representatives and help people.  As an Independent, the only format that allows me to get my message out there besides flyers is social media.<\/p> <p>  Another part of getting our message out is a mobile office that gets us into the county.  In respect of the amount of time it takes me to run a mobile office, I could target each area if I wanted to and put a message out on social media but people want to meet and interact with you on the ground.  That is what politicians do.  I have met my share of hostile people on doorsteps.  I have met people who were nice to me but I have also met people who were hostile.  If, in addition to using social media, you are out there on the ground with the people, they will get a sense of who you are and what you are about.  I am against anybody using social media for the wrong reasons and it needs to be regulated.  I reiterate that when it comes to politics.  The national broadcaster should be regulated as well so that everybody from every county regardless of party membership or none should get air time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#E00100","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":620,"content":"<p>Is there any crossover between the office of the Press Ombudsman and social media companies regarding anonymous accounts?

The Government proposal for an online safety commissioner is vital for dealing with some of the issues mentioned by the Chairman.  The issue of anonymity is central.  Anonymity allows people to say virtually what they like free of any concerns about any comeback.  We have had letters to newspapers for hundreds of years but those letters have a name at the bottom.  The person has put his or her name there and said this is what his or her views are but if you go on social media, you can be anonymous, have a <i>nom de plume<\/i>or have several different names.  One of the issues is the need to find some mechanism of ensuring that people cannot hide behind anonymity.  I do not think we should buy into social media companies saying they cannot trace people.  Of course, they can trace a person.  Everybody can be traced.  The committee will recall that last year, there were successful prosecutions of citizens who named children involved in court cases, etc., where the garda&iacute; were able to find out who was behind it even though the tweets were made anonymously so it can be done.  Anonymity is a major issue.  Interestingly, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>has by and large stopped taking comments under its articles and <i>The Irish Times <\/i>has introduced a requirement that only people who have registered with it can put up comments.  This has, if I may use the term, civilised the comments to a certain extent in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>and reduced that damage in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  It is very difficult to deal with.<br\/><br\/>I recognise that social media is a very useful platform for Deputies and Senators to address the public and that engaging in debate with trolls who go after them is not beneficial.  I am not saying social media is not valuable.  It is hugely valuable as a means to communication.  It is also a very effective means of communication because it is not expensive.  You can see how at election time, more and more parties are putting resources into their social media campaigns.<\/p><p>We just have to recognise they are now a major player in the field and need to be regulated in the same way that print, radio and television are regulated.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy O'Donoghue's remarks about RT&Eacute;, it does not come under my remit at all.  I used to work in RT&Eacute;, so the Deputy will allow me to be biased, but I cannot answer as to how RT&Eacute; should deal with independence.  From my experience - I am going back more than a decade - when you put together current affairs programmes, you think of Government and Opposition.  Now we have the unusual position of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party in government and Sinn F&eacute;in as the major Opposition party, so they tend to get the lion's share of the space.  Common sense would say there has to be space for Independents as well.  At the moment, however, if I were a current affairs producer and had only two slots, I would think Government and Opposition and, therefore, I would think Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Greens and then, on the Opposition, Sinn F&eacute;in first and Labour second.  I would probably think of Independents and lesser groupings only after that.  I can understand the sense of grievance Independents have that it simply never seems to be their turn, but it is not for me to comment on that because RT&Eacute;, and broadcasting in general, does not come under my remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Feeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>To be clear, I have no problem with anonymous accounts if people use social media in a good way.

I thank him for his attendance.  I felt for him a moment ago as he was entering into the snake pit of talking about Independents.  You could insult one Independent and have a complaint made against you, perhaps to the Press Ombudsman himself.  In all seriousness, I thank Mr. Feeney for his attendance and for the opportunity for the committee to examine the annual reports from 2018 through to 2020.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Higgins, referred to the coverage over the course of the pandemic, the resilience of the press and the reliance of the public on the press for information.  The press has been invaluable, and there are many trusted sources.  Mr. Feeney mentioned the difference between online and print.  There is definitely a difference between material produced by reputable, trained and trusted journalists and some of the online content created by individuals.  Of course, there is no fact-checking of the latter, and that places a significant onus on the press and, indeed, Mr. Feeney and the Press Council.<\/p> <p>  I note from Mr. Feeney's opening remarks his welcome for the online safety commissioner and the media authority.  It is important to have the embrace of Mr. Feeney's office and that of the Press Council in time.  It is important that it is first of all recognised that there is an issue and that it is not just a monetary issue facing media organisations.  There are also issues of trust and bias involved, and public confidence needs to be restored.  I note what Mr. Feeney said about the Future of Media Commission and its awaited report.  I will say no more about those aspects but I acknowledge and welcome what Mr. Feeney has said.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Feeney's opening statement, I note that his office was established in 2008.  As a new Member of the House, certainly a new member of this committee, I welcome the fact that he is before us today.  How many complaints, on average, has his office dealt with year on year?  I know he will not go into any specifics, but what is the general figure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#F00400","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>We average 400 complaints a year, but a proportion of those are misdirected.  They are complaints about RT&Eacute; or whatever else.  We send them on to the BAI or, if the complaint relates to advertising, the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.  I issue, on average, only about 30 formal decisions each year.  A lot of our complaints are dealt with by conciliation.  Our office comprises only two and a half whole-time equivalents.  One of the other people is our case officer.  Her job is to try to resolve complaints informally first.  That is very effective because a lot of the time there is something inaccurate in a newspaper and as long as the record is correct the person is happy enough.  It is easy enough to correct the online record now.  Obviously, if the complaint relates to a court case and the complainant does not like the fact that his or her conviction for drink-driving is reported, there is nothing an editor can do about that.  That is on the public record and will remain so.  If there is something inaccurate, however, that can be changed very quickly.  Often all that is required is publication of a letter or, sometimes, a clarification or correction in the next edition of the newspaper.  That is an important part of our office.  As a previous speaker said, it is not just about fining social media companies; it is about creating a climate in which journalists are answerable and aware that there is a code of practice and that it is important they adhere to it.  That helps to improve overall standards of journalism because the first principle is truth and accuracy.  I do not know a journalist who does not believe in the value of truth and accuracy because that is where public confidence lies.  Of course there will be examples of things being exaggerated and headlines overstating the case, and the sense of outrage may not accurately reflect the degree to which there has been a minor transgression or something like that.  Obviously, there are degrees to be considered.  Overall, however, my view is that the Irish public are well served by their newspapers.  They are generally a very accurate source.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic is a good example of that.  Our work has changed radically in the past two years because we get a large number of complaints about pandemic coverage.  The majority of those complaints, however, are from people who are basically opposed to vaccination or measures such as working from home, mask wearing, etc.  What they are really doing is expressing their disagreement.  They are not able to point me to any breaches of the code because if the journalists report accurately and factually what the situation is, they will not be in breach of the code.  It is the message that such complainants do not like rather than the journalism itself.  My view - I would say the same of broadcasting as of print - is that in Ireland the pandemic has been well handled and responsibly handled.  The press has not ignored the fact that there are people who are opposed to vaccination, the fact that there are people who disagreed with some of the measures taken or the fact that there have been breaches of requirements, but it has, I think, reported them in a balanced and reasonable manner.  My view, therefore, is that the pandemic has helped public confidence in traditional media.  That is probably contrasted with social media, where most of the claims about the dangers of vaccination etc. and most of the inaccurate claims about Covid are to be found.  One of the problems we face with complaints we receive is that the people who complain quote as their sources things they have found on social media that are not reliable.  Newspapers will not do that.  They will not quote unreliable material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Feeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Feeney for that comprehensive response.

Some complaints are not processed because they are not about individual articles but about the press in general or about something published more than three months previously.<\/p><p>We have a strict rule that an article being complained about has to have been published within the previous three months.  The other requirement is that people have to show they are personally affected.  This is to stop us being used by campaigning groups.  It does not necessarily mean only individuals can complain.  We will accept complaints from lobby groups and pressure groups on behalf of their members also.  It is not just individuals but also groups.  I will give a specific example of this.  Some years ago we received a complaint from the Israeli ambassador about Middle East coverage in an Irish newspaper.

This tradition of independence of government has held up right through to the present day.  There is an historical reason.  Broadcasting on radio and television has been regulated by government since its inception.  Most people would accept that broadcasting has a great deal of freedom of expression, as much as the print industry, and yet it is regulated.  There is a feeling among editors and proprietors of newspapers that historically they have never been regulated by the Government and that it is important in terms of freedom of impression.<\/p> <p>  We will get people who say that because newspapers rely a lot on government-funded advertising, such as for road safety or Covid measures, that they are indirectly influenced by the fact their commercial relationship with government includes government advertisement.

As people have said, it is about targeting the message to individuals.  Campaigns have moved very much online.  I was struck by a comment Mr. Feeney made at the end of his opening statement about the complaints he received.  Complaints were about articles and not general claims about the press.

One of the reasons for it is that editors feel that the journalist who wrote it may have moved on after three months.  It may have been a freelance journalist with whom the publication no longer has contact, which would be difficult to deal with.<\/p> <p>  A point in support of what Deputy Devlin is asking is that the impact of inaccuracy may remain after three months if it is online.  If I published something more than three months ago in a newspaper it is quite possible it can be googled six months, a year or two years later.  There is an issue with the effectiveness of Google that material can be found one, two or five years later.  When we receive complaints from people about things published more than three months ago we advise them of their right to be forgotten under European legislation.

Much of it has to do with what is already public record information.  Editors are very reluctant to take down public record information because it distorts the historical fact that someone was convicted.  There is a case to be made that people have a right to re-establish their reputation.  I will give an example from my time working in RT&Eacute;.  A man contacted me in RT&Eacute; to say his son was reaching secondary school age and he had the same Christian name and surname as the father.  He was worried his school friends would Google this boy's name and find the father had a minor conviction from 20 years ago.  I absolutely sympathised with this because it seemed to be unfair that this minor conviction should still be accessible 20 years later.  It was doubly unfair the man's child could be tarnished with this brush.<\/p> <p>  The right to be forgotten is important.  It is quite nuanced and we have to get the balance right.  We should not erase material that is significant.  It may well be that a criminal prosecution 20 years ago is still relevant today because the person may still be a criminal but there is a balance to be drawn if people have done their time and re-established their reputations.  Many people are unaware of it.  People are not aware of how it works.  Perhaps the European Commission could fund advertising about the right to be forgotten, informing people about how to go about the process.

I enjoyed Mr. Feeney's presentation.  He is open and frank.  He made it very interesting.  He is bang on the button regarding much of the material we are dealing with.  I have to say, as others have, that I regret the difficulties the regional and local printed press are going through.  I am thinking about my area where I have to get my message out.  This is in Roscommon, Longford, Leitrim, Mayo, part of Galway and Westmeath.  I will not mention all of the publications that are there but the number in the region is extraordinary.  They have served the communities very well.  I have done local notes for local newspapers and minor articles for them.  I mainly worked in local radio.  I made a contribution to a television programme on TG4 for two and a half years.  I used to work with a company called Irish TV.  I know a lot about this.<\/p> <p>  I have to go back to the area of social media.<\/p><p>Like many others, I have suffered.  I will not bring up the whole story again because it has been well documented.  Thousands have suffered.  Mr. Feeney mentioned women.  They have suffered terribly.  I want to bring up the women we cannot see.  Things happened in my family.  We could be talking about your daughter, your mother, your wife, your sister or your sister-in-law.  Some of them were very disturbed by what was going on.  They were receiving vile threats on social media.  I have to say it was very well documented by the national and local press.  They did a very good job on it.  It was notoriously difficult to get Facebook to take down material - day in, day out and week in, week out.  There were vile threats.  We can talk about this again.  I do not think that is right.  Many people who are hidden in the background, such as family members, are really upset and disturbed by this.  Not only has this happened to me, but it has also happened to many people.  I am therefore still not satisfied that the social media outlets are committed and dedicated to coming clean about all of this.  We have a lot of work to do.<br\/><br\/>I do not know what Mr. Feeney&rsquo;s opinions are on anonymous accounts.  I know some people say they do not have a bother with them.  I have a bother with anonymous accounts, to be open and frank with the committee.  I would like to know Mr. Feeney&rsquo;s opinion on them.  He mentioned <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>, which has a really good system, as has been stated.  If we could develop that for our local media, it would be good.  He is right.  The local media put up two or three stories and hope to attract people to them, but they will not be able to keep going financially with the way things are.  That is the reality.  Social media is eating them up.  It is really eating them up.  Something has to be done urgently.<br\/><br\/>On the overseas platforms, there is much controversy about how much is being done from outside the country.  Has Mr. Feeney any concerns about that?  These systems are working from outside the country.  They are coming up with a lot of very personal material against people.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Devlin dealt very well with policies about the right to be forgotten.  We discussed that.<br\/><br\/>Could Mr. Feeney answer some of the questions I have asked?  I will not come in again.  I think that we as a committee have to look for more staff for the Press Council of Ireland.  I hope that will happen quickly.  The role they have and what they will have to deal with in the coming years will be extraordinary.  We are having a really good discussion today.  If Mr. Feeney could make a few comments, it would be great.  I pay tribute to all of the local papers in terms of the Covid-19 coverage.  They were very important, particularly for the older generation, who might still read the paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#G01200","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Mechanisms need to be found to provide support for local media because it simply will not have enough resources to be able to carry out its function.  I do not have the answer to that.  Other countries such as Austria have systems of providing support in terms of distribution and training for local media, etc.  These systems do not have any influence or editorial involvement.  The chances of local newspapers being able to compete successfully against much more powerful opposition is certainly a source of worry.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned families of public figures.  One of the principles in our code is the right to privacy.  While this is not an absolute right and we all respect that, everybody has the right to privacy.  If that right to privacy is breached, it has to be in the public interest.  In my view, family members of public figures have exactly the same right to privacy as every other citizen.  One cannot put in photographs of children of Deputies or Senators, or their wives or husbands, without permission if it is not relevant to the story.  The right to privacy is quite strong in the code.  One of the areas on which I have pushed is the need for newspaper picture editors to think carefully about why a photograph of a child is there.  Is it right that it should be there?  What is the context in which that photograph was used?  Why is information about the husband or wife of a Deputy or Senator given when it is not relevant to the story?  There has been a bit of an improvement in recent years among journalists in their understanding of the right to privacy of family members.<\/p> <p>  We live in a world where images are just pulled down off social media all the time.  I will give a good and possibly hurtful example of that.  Some years ago, early in the new year, a number of students from Institute of Technology Carlow were killed in a car crash.  The newspapers put up their photographs immediately.  All the photographs were taken from their Facebook pages.  They all showed them in a sort of party mode.  It was not appropriate because this was a very solemn time.  It was very distressing for the families.  In the past, newspapers would have gone around to the house and asked for a photograph of the son or daughter.  They would have been given a photograph which the family thought was appropriate.  Nowadays, everything is just pulled down off social media.  The tone and context is not right.  The Senator might remember the six Irish students who were killed in California when a balcony collapsed.  It was the same issue there.  The photographs showed them celebrating and being happy at an 18th birthday party or a 21st birthday party.  What was needed there was a sober photograph.  We have to work hard to make picture editors and editors in general aware that the context is terribly important.  If you have an article about a Deputy or Senator, you have to justify giving any information about that person's family.  It has to be relevant.  If it is not relevant, you need to get their permission to use it because they are private citizens.  You have to be very careful about photographing children.  I upheld a complaint recently about a picture of a funeral of a criminal.  Photographs showed another criminal who was at the funeral.  He was holding his child in his arms.  They did not pixellate the child&rsquo;s face.  One could argue public interest in showing criminal solidarity.  However, one could not argue any justification for including a photograph of the child.  It is so easy to pixellate a photograph of children.<\/p> <p>  Part of my job is to make sure editors are aware of the importance of taking privacy rights into account.  Social media has distorted that because it is now so easy to get images.  It is so easy to get stories from social media.  In my view, we had a very bad breach a couple of years ago when a journalist who was a member of a private WhatsApp group that talked about parenting issues took a story from information that was provided in that private group and published it as an article, without any thought of asking the person who put up the information whether they wanted it published.  I thought that was a terrible breach of that person's privacy.  It was simply an unjustified piece of journalism.  Lessons have to be learned.  When mistakes are made, journalists have to be aware that the decision will be published and it will be said in public that they behaved badly and broke the code, etc.  Hopefully, then they will behave better in the future.  I hope that answers some of the Senator&rsquo;s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Feeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":646,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Feeney be able to answer on anonymous accounts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#H00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":647,"content":"<p>In my personal view, anonymity allows too much freedom to abuse, to defame people and to be aggressive, etc.  I really do not see why social media companies cannot be held responsible, when they are able to trace anonymous people very quickly.  I simply do not buy into it.  People were convicted recently of putting up the identities of the boys who murdered a poor girl in west Dublin.  It was possible to find out who those people were, even though they put up the tweets anonymously.  Social media companies have that information.  If they do not have it, they should have it.  People are being given the space to say things which can be hurtful, harmful or damaging, etc.  They should be traced, just as they would be if they put up child abuse content or child pornography.  We should be able to find out who is putting that up.<\/p> <p>  It is a factor that social media is international.  You will find that the material originates somewhere in California or in Indonesia.  However, international law enforcement agencies should be able to go to California or Indonesia and find out who the child pornographers are.  There has been great success in prosecuting people in respect of child pornography.  However, the same applies to other forms of misuse of social media - it should be possible to find out who the person is.  I have mixed views on anonymity.  Generally, I think newspaper letter writers are much better if they put their name to the end of it.  This is because you will know where person is coming from.  You will know that the man in question owns a pub, for example, and that is why he is making a certain argument, or whatever else it happens to be.  If you just put up \"Peter Pan\", you do not get that context.  Much of the time, you discover that the local person might have a particular insight into a particular issue, etc.<\/p> <p>  I share the Senator&rsquo;s view about the value of local broadcasting, local radio services and local newspapers.  The point made by Deputy Devlin that Dublin does not have that is a relevant factor.  If I go down to Cork, I can listen to Red FM or other Cork radio stations.  I can stray into Kerry and Clare, etc.  I can get my local newspapers.<\/p><p>However, I do not have the equivalent in Dublin.  Many people in rural Ireland say the national newspapers are the Dublin newspapers, but if you look at a newspaper like the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, it is a national newspaper but it provides very comprehensive coverage of counties Cork and Kerry and, to a lesser extent, Limerick, Waterford and other counties.  The issue is that in Dublin there is not an equivalent of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>.  There are small publications like the <i>Dublin Inquirer<\/i>, but they have a very marginal impact because, I am afraid their circulation is in the low thousands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Feeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Feeney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#J00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Mr. Feeney is very welcome.  I admire his openness and willingness to listen and answer questions.  If I may, I will focus on social media, although I know he has been fairly well quizzed on it.  In a recent radio programme, I listened to a lady who was the owner of a bed and breakfast down the country.  In seeking to put up an image on her website, she googled a particular part of her local area, found a photo, downloaded it and put it up on her website.  Within a few days she had a letter from a solicitor based in Germany or Poland - I am not sure, but it might have been a German company with a Polish office - who wanted &euro;5,000 for her infringement of copyright.  Furthermore, the threat was that they wanted &euro;5,000 for every infringement from her site to any other site.  If a company can engage in such litigation, why can Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn or any other company turn around and say they are not publishers?  Why can they allow any rubbish that people want to put up?  All of us on this platform now have suffered massive attacks at some stage on social media.  On one particular occasion, after asking a simple question regarding a particular vaccine in the Seanad I was subjected to a weekend of absolute torture by members of the medical profession.  It was only when one of them said that he would diagnose me as having a psychotic disease that I said he had gone too far and I would take it up with the Medical Council.  Within five minutes, every single tweet disappeared.  I know the medical practices that were involved.  I know exactly where they are and who the doctors are.  That is what can happen on social media.  I would be telling a lie if I said it did not impact my mental health that night as I tried to defend myself.  My colleague from Limerick said social media needs to be a one-way street for people in politics and that we should not bother interacting with people.  I am still rather perplexed as to why the likes of Facebook are not responsible.  I had my own Facebook page cloned on several occasions, where people purported to be me and contacted people with messages that certainly would not come from me.

Social media have argued since the beginning that they are not publishers; they simply facilitate.  What they are doing is providing links to other sources who should be responsible for the content.  That fig leaf of an argument has been used by social media companies for years, since the very beginning, that they do not publish anything, they just draw our attention to something somebody else has published.  The truth is that now it is seen to be just a legal fig leaf and that social media companies have to accept responsibility for what goes up on their platforms, and they have to be liable for it.  Otherwise, they can be as irresponsible as they want to be.  The era in which social media get away with saying that they are not publishers and that they simply provide information and access to other people is largely over.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raises a terribly important point regarding copyright.  It is not part of the Press Ombudsman's remit.  We do not have to deal with copyright issues, but he raises an important point, which is that people put material up on Facebook and all the other platforms and we think that once it is up there we can use it wherever we like.  We think that we can take it, copy it and reuse it, but copyright remains with someone else.  If you put something up on Facebook and you do not impose any restrictions on other people accessing it, it is quite difficult to justify other people not taking that image, but there is a lack of understanding that material that is available on Facebook can be used by anybody else in any context they like.  I fully sympathise with Senator Craughwell's constituent who put up a photograph and then got a demand for &euro;5,000.  It was probably the first photograph she saw that looked nice.  If you go to Google and put in Gougane Barra, you will get hundreds of nice photographs of Gougane Barra.  Google will say underneath the photos who owns the copyright.  If it is Bord F&aacute;ilte or Cork County Council, you can be pretty certain that it is freely available to use by others, but all it requires is a phone call or an email to find out if that is the case.<\/p> <p>  I will give a very simple example.  We appointed a new chairman of the Press Council last week because our outgoing chairman had reached the end of his term.  One of the newspapers came back to me and said they were looking for a photograph of him.  We had not taken any photograph because he had only been appointed that day, so I went to Google and got lots of photographs of him.  I saw one there which said the copyright was owned by Queen's University Belfast, because he is a visiting professor in Belfast.  I got in touch with the communications people in Queen's and asked if I had permission to use the photograph and they said it was free to use in any context people liked.  We were quite comfortable in using that photograph.  I could have taken another photograph that belonged to a photographic agency, and it would have retained copyright of it.  I would have taken the risk then of being liable, but the public do not understand that.  They think anything that is available on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or wherever else can be used in any context they like.  It is a real danger, and it can be very frightening if you get a demand for &euro;5,000 for using a photograph.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Feeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":652,"content":"<p>In its search engine tools, Google provides people with a facility to check the copyright of photographs.  There are many sites that you can buy the images from.  I was rather shocked to find that my own image is copyrighted, not by me, but by the person who took the photograph.  I fully understand that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise another sensitive issue concerning the media in general.  The august Lower House in Leinster House gets bags of publicity and coverage.  However, that is not the case with the more senior, more relaxed Upper House.  That said, most of the Senators who are present get plenty of coverage in the media, but there are some very valid and important debates on legislation that take place in the Upper House and they never see the light of day.  It strikes me that there is a bias in the media which feeds into the public belief that the Seanad is a waste of space, should not be there, should have been got rid of, that they are all there just sitting down, scratching their bums, doing nothing worthwhile.  I would be the last person to say that I have produced anything great in this Seanad but some of my colleagues have been absolutely outstanding in the context of some of the issues they have brought forward.  Senator Warfield has made a wonderful case for voting rights for 16-year olds.  If I stood up tomorrow morning and said a seagull stole a burger out of my hand as I was walking down Molesworth Street, I would get coverage in the media, yet Senator Warfield, who makes a very important argument for 16-year-olds to vote, gets very little publicity at all.  I do not know that it falls into Mr. Feeney's remit to look at the equality of publicity, if one likes, for the two Houses, but it is something that bothers me.  I have no complaint myself with the media.  I do quite well out of them, but it does bother me that some of my colleagues who are outstanding people in their own right never see the light of day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#J00500","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Independents probably suffer more than members of parties.  My experience when I used to work in RT&Eacute; is that all the parties have PR machines or communications teams behind them so they would prompt journalists, whereas, even though, as Senator Craughwell says, there is a group of 23 Independents, the members are very diverse, they do not speak in one voice and they do not have PR or communications people working on their collective behalf.  It is true that Independents probably do not get as much attention as the parties.  It is more than 20 years since I was editor of current affairs, but I know that I would have expected the press people for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and the Green Party to be on to me if they felt their people were not getting enough attention.<\/p><p>The Seanad itself needs to collectively push this message among journalists, which is that it is the Upper House and has a very important part to play in the scrutiny of all legislation and that if it they ignore it, they are ignoring an important part of the legislative process and the public are short-changed as a result of that.  It is not, however, an issue that has ever crossed my path as Press Ombudsman.  We have never had complaints.  It would be difficult to see how one could fit any complaints from Members of the Seanad that they are not getting much attention under the code of practice in any case.

The printed press, particularly, and, indeed, both TV stations and all radio stations operating in the Republic, are extremely sensitive to the litigious nature of the Irish citizen.  How much is this impacting the proverbial hiding of stories?<\/p> <p>  We might think about some of the horrendous things that happened in this country down through the years that were buried until such a time as they were proved beyond any doubt - not beyond reasonable doubt but any doubt - that, in fact, that issue had occurred or the person had been maligned or whatever.

I know from talking to editors that when they are faced with a risk of being sued for defamation and pulling that part of the story, often nowadays, they decide for commercial reasons that the wiser thing to do is pull that part of the story.  That is, therefore, the dead hand impact on investigative journalism.<\/p> <p>  I know that in the past, editors and proprietors would say that if they gave this fella &euro;3,000 or &euro;5,000, he might go away.  That adds up, however, if there are 30 people and someone says that to get them to go away.  The newspapers will know that legal costs will greatly exceed that anyway.  In the past, there has been a view that if a person has not got much of a case but if &euro;3,000 will get rid of him or her, maybe if we give that person &euro;3,000, he or she will go away.  That eats into the resources available for employing journalists.  It also impacts on stories.<\/p> <p>  Again, talking from my own experience, a long time ago in RT&Eacute;, we were doing a report on water bailiffs in County Waterford.  Our lawyers told us we had to take this and that out and by the time they had dealt with all the issues they said had to be taken out, the report was incoherent.  We actually should not have broadcast that report at all.  We should have recognised that so much of it had to be pulled for legal reasons that we could not do it.  Remember, the level of proof required in a defamation action is very high.  Journalists will say that they have something from a very reliable source but if they cannot bring that source into court to testify and give evidence on their behalf, that is useless really.  It is very difficult but it is the sheer level of awards.  Citizens are entitled to their reputations, of course, and defamation is important.  Giving people &euro;1 million or &euro;400,000 or whatever it  happens to be, however, is multiples of what happens in other countries.<\/p> <p>  I was in Austria a couple of years ago at a conference for press ombudsmen.  The local newspapers were all writing about &euro;25,000 that was awarded in a defamation case against a newspaper in Austria and how this was the highest figure ever awarded.  A figure of &euro;25,000 in Ireland is nothing.  People start off thinking of six figure sums.  It is kind of a joke.  What re-establishes reputation?  If the newspaper is found to be inaccurate and guilty of having printed something inaccurate about a person, that should be his or her reputation re-established.  A person should not have to get &euro;100,000.  I absolutely understand why citizens are entitled to have their reputations protected and that defamation is important.  I do not know why we need &euro;1 million or &euro;500,000 because remember, the lawyers may also be on a percentage of that figure - without being disrespectful to lawyers - to re-establish a person's reputation.  I think it is distorted at the moment.<\/p> <p>  My hope is that the review of the Defamation Act will put in place some measures to bring levels of awards in Ireland down to comparable levels in other countries, which will still maintain the importance of the protection of defamation laws and the importance of people's reputations but yet not damage the media in the process of settlements.  That is really for the review of the  Defamation Act, however.  As I said, a five-year review was built into the 2009 Act.  That was in 2014; we are now in 2022 and we have not seen it yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Feeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>If we look at a defamation case where the ordinary working guy, Joe Bloggs, is minding his own business and gets mentioned in a newspaper, nobody would be afraid to mention his name.

We have a separation of powers in this country with the Government or Oireachtas on one side and the courts on the other.  It is my view that the press sort of floats between the two.

Commercial pressure on our newspapers and magazines has now diminished or is in the process of diminishing the ability of the press to carry out that function.  Equally so, the resources available for radio broadcasting and some television broadcasting are not sufficient to carry out that function.<br\/><br\/>I would hope in the years to come that Government may take some measures to ensure there is a better balance between what the multinationals take out of the country and what they give back in comparison to what the indigenous media do.  A good example of that is Sky.  I read recently that Sky takes in excess of more than &euro;100 million out of the Irish economy each year.  What does it out back into the Irish economy?  Practically nothing.  It is, therefore, a loss of resources that could be used to ensure that the Irish media have the resources to carry out its function.<br\/><br\/>Of course, there will be accusations that when one goes down that path, Government will then be funding or supporting the industry through commercial considerations but one can argue that the licence fee does that already for television broadcasting.  I find very few politicians who will say to me that RT&Eacute; is on the side of the Government or politicians.  They will argue that it is actually too critical at times.  I am not sure funding is that significant a factor.  The key thing is that the Irish media play an important part in the democratic process and any measure that can be taken should be taken to ensure that they survive a rapidly changing and internationalising environment where resources are going out of the country rather than into it.<br\/><br\/>Having said that, I am really pleased that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube etc. all have big operations in Ireland.  I remember talking to my Dutch colleague recently and telling her that Facebook was just up the road from me and has thousands of direct employers and indirect contractors working in Dublin.  She said her problem was that they have nobody from Facebook working in Holland.  It is just such a different environment.  At least we have it here and we can engage with it.  In a way, that is a lever the Government can use.

Brexit may have contributed to that slight fear.<br\/><br\/>At the moment, however, all the social media companies have invested heavily in Ireland and are here because they think it works.

Now, however, it is saying that if it refers to the <i>Sydney Evening Post<\/i>or whatever it is, it will give some payment to that publication because that information and journalism in the <i>Sydney Evening Post <\/i>is really attracting people; not the fact that Facebook just put up a link.  There are, therefore, signs of improvement but companies will need to be put under pressure.<\/p><p>Earlier, one of the Senator's colleagues questioned how seriously social media companies take this.

The media should reflect the whole of society and that should mean that people who have skills and something to say who have not had the advantages of a good secondary education or good third level education should not be excluded from the media.  I would like to see schemes put in place of apprenticeships, attachments or secondments to encourage people who have not come through the formal structures of studying media in Dublin City University, University of Limerick or wherever to be able to get in to journalism.  None of us would disagree that there is no particular correlation between people's ability and their formal qualifications.  It is where you are born and what changes you that contributes so much to where you end up.  You have got to accept a society where you recognise that not all people start off with equal opportunities and put in place measures which help them.  Bursaries, apprenticeship schemes, etc., are one way of dealing with that.<\/p> <p>  This is also relevant in Ireland for the sons and daughters of immigrants.  We still have an overwhelmingly white Irish media.  If you walk down Kildare Street, you will see that we are now living in a different society.  We are living in a society with many people of African origin and many people of Asian origin.  They are not reflected in the Irish media.

We have an ongoing issue with trying to establish a means whereby if our decision must be published online that it will have impact in the online edition of the publication.  The argument for publication on the front page was lost in 2007 when the editors would not agree to it.

The problem with directly funding newspapers is that for some people it would create the perception that they were no longer independent of the Government.  Credibility demands that newspapers are seen to be independent of the Government, and other vested interests of course, including employers and business organisations, etc.  Getting the balance and perception right is not easy.  Therefore, direct funding of the media by the Government could present problems and there is a need to explore other means of doing this.<\/p> <p>  One of the suggestions could be levies on social media, which are taking 85% of the revenue of newspapers.  Such revenue could be channelled to local media without it being seen to be part of Government funding.  There are mechanisms that could be explored.

There are other little measures like that could be used.<\/p> <p>  Consideration could be given to the Government being involved.

I give the example of the hospital or medical records of politicians being put on public record without their approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022021700002#N00300","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I was freedom of information officer for RT&Eacute; for 13 years and ceased ten years ago.

I came away from that convinced of the value and importance of freedom of information.  It is an important power which provides information citizens are entitled to.

It is used to disparage people for doing legitimate things in a legitimate way.  <\/p> <p>  Getting the balance right is difficult.  However, the Ombudsman, who is also the Information Commissioner, has in place highly skilled staff who are good at weighing up what is in the pubic interest.  I agree that it is sometimes frustrating to see FOI used in a way that trivialises it and to disparage people but it is an important power for the citizen and for journalists.  I would be reluctant to see any reduction in use of freedom of information legislation.  It can be nuanced.

Medical records are private and the only reason to publish it is if one could argue effectively and forcefully that is was in the public interest.  If Senator Buttimer had Covid in February this year and did not tell anybody about it, I cannot see any reason why any member of the public should know that.  If spouses or children of public figures had Covid, I cannot see any reason to publish that.<\/p> <p>  Early in the pandemic, a newspaper published a well-intentioned article on five people who had died of Covid but it had not thought of asking the families of those people if they wanted the public to know that the person had died.  We upheld that complaint.  It was not done out of malice.  It was done with good intentions and was a good article which brought home the human tragedy of Covid.  One family said they did not want people to know their relative had Covid, put in a complaint and I upheld it.  I would say the same about politicians.  Unless it is shown that the politician having Covid has influenced his or her public statements, stances or policies, I cannot see how that could be justified.  <\/p> <p>  Going back to the death of Brian Lenihan Jnr., I will give a personal opinion.  I was disappointed that reports of his illness were published.  One could argue that a healthy Minister for Finance is important but there was a degree of insensitivity there which surprised me.  My recollection is it was published on St. Stephen's Day, when he was home with his family.  His family had to be rushed to be told because it was to be published a couple of days later.  It was broadcasting, rather than print.

I am one of the people for whom Covid is not over yet so I appreciate the facility.  I will talk about my experience of third-level education.  This is a very important area for people with disabilities but it is overlooked because we presume the supports are in place.  People think that everything must surely be in place at third level and postgraduate level, which I am going to talk about, to make education possible for people with disabilities, but it is not.  There is a huge gap between what we say we do, what actually happens and what is possible for a person.  I am conscious of the time so I will talk about three main things: how funding is set up for third level, particularly postgraduates and PhDs; how the social welfare system prevents people with disabilities going on to education and training; and, for those lucky people who do make it in to third level, the problems that come up with the fund for students with disabilities and the disability services within third level<\/p> <p>  I am only one person and I am only one person with a disability.  I was in a particularly bad mood when I wrote my submission what seems like 18 months ago, so I have tempered my remarks.  I encourage the committee to extend its consultation and talk to a wider range of people with disabilities who are studying at third level, particularly postgraduates, because there is a lot more to it than what I am about to say. <\/p> <p>  I will tell the committee a little about myself to set the context.  I did not do particularly well in school.  I had dyslexia, which was not diagnosed until I was in my 30s.  That was not unusual as I went to school in the 1970s and 1980s and if we had heating, we thought we were blessed.  I was born with a couple of other health issues as well.  I went into the workforce, meandered along and got a little education along the way - a certificate here, half a diploma there.  I managed to get an MA in my 30s because DCU allowed me to do an MA without having an undergraduate degree, but that is a story for another time.  Things were going well and then, about 15 years ago, I got sick.  I got very sick and I just could not get better.  This mystery ailment ran right through my system and damaged my eyes, my balance, my nervous system and my hearing, and left me with lots of life-altering impairments and disabilities.  I have neuroborreliosis, which is late stage or chronic Lyme disease.  Even though I managed to get treatment a few years ago, it had gone through my system to such an extent that it has left me with visual impairments and everything I see is blurred.  I am hard of hearing but I also have tinnitus so I cannot wear hearing aids all the time.  I fall over a lot as my balance is gone.  I have vertigo, migraines and chronic pain.  There is a whole list of things.  My immune system is suppressed so I get everything that is going around.  That includes Covid, which I have gotten twice now despite being very careful.  My hands swell from Lyme arthritis so I cannot read or write very well.<\/p> <p>  I am going through this list just to show that disabilities are not one thing.  They can be multi-systemic.  They affect different people in different ways and are not always visible.  Just because you cannot see someone has a disability or an impairment does not mean it is not there.  People with chronic Lyme, MS, Lupus or any similar disability have good and bad days.  Members cannot see it because of my nice backdrop of San Francisco but right now I am holding onto the kitchen table to keep my balance.  I will be able to do that for ten minutes and then I will sit down and participate in the rest of the meeting from more of a prone position.  It is quite hard to do that in education and it is obviously very hard to do it in the workplace.  I have had the benefit of some higher education and had a very good job.  I was the research manager at the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, before I got sick and I managed 14 people.  I think I have a lot to contribute but I need to go back and upskill, get a new qualification and update my academic qualifications because I need access to well-paid but flexible part-time work.<\/p> <p>  Why is that so hard?  On paper, it would seem all these things are already in place.  Do we not have the disability access route to education, DARE, programme, the fund for student disabilities and a range of things that are just waiting for me to pick them up and take advantage of them?  We actually do not.  Someone with my type of disability only has so much energy and capacity per day and I simply cannot go back to college full time.  I need part-time options.  As I am also on social welfare and in receipt of an invalidity pension, I need funded education opportunities.  At third level, particularly postgraduate and PhD level, all the supports, including those from SUSI, the Irish Research Council and scholarships from individual universities, are provided with the expectation that the recipient studies full time, so I and people like me are automatically excluded.  Why is that?  Are we not studying the same thing?  Do I not end up with the same qualification, even if it takes me that little bit longer?  Am I not getting the same skills and knowledge?  We are saying to people that full-time education at third and postgraduate level is good but part time is something else and they have to fund that themselves.  They cannot access the huge amounts the Government is quite rightly investing in third-level education.  The Government says it wants us to be a high-skill economy and that it wants people like me, with disabilities, back in the workforce if we are able.  It says it wants us back in some capacity.  It says it wants our skills, talents and passions but that is only if we can do it full-time.<\/p> <p>  At a university level, when there are scholarships available, not only are students meant to study full time at a PhD level but they also have to teach and do work to be eligible for the scholarship.  That just means people with disabilities are automatically excluded.  The vision statements and nice flowery words that universities, the Minister and the Department of Education use about inclusivity and equality do not mean anything if the very structures they have set up are excluding people who need to study part time.  Obviously, this does not only affect people with disabilities.  There are lone parents and people in rural areas in these situations as well.  However, people with disabilities physically cannot do it full time.  That is not the case with everyone but it is for people like me who have my type of illness and disabilities.  That is the big thing.  I want to go back to education but I cannot because I cannot afford the fees and the only funded options are full time.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is social welfare.  As members probably know from their constituents, the main two social welfare options for people with disabilities are the disability allowance and the invalidity pension.  While the disability allowance is not perfect, it has inherent flexibility.  People can dabble in education or work a little bit and as long as they keep it under certain limits they can keep their payment and none of their secondary benefits, like the very precious medical card, are at risk.  The invalidity pension is not set up like that.  The medical criteria are the same for the disability allowance and the invalidity pension but one is means tested and the other is not.  That is the only difference.  However, the invalidity pension is administered in a completely different way and is a very inflexible payment.  If someone on the invalidity pension wants to go back into the workforce they have to go on the partial capacity benefit, which means they risk losing at least 25%, if not 50%, of their payment.  It also puts at risk things like the medical card, home help and all the supports that have probably taken them a decade to build up.  For many people like me, that is too high a risk.  It is just because of the misfortune that I happened to qualify for the invalidity pension and not the disability allowance.  It is the same amount of money and the same medical criteria, but one group of people with a disability is trapped and one group is not.  Disability allowance is far from perfect but it has advantages that the invalidity pension does not.  Why is that?<\/p> <p>  Bringing in funded part-time options or more flexibility for people with a disability within the social welfare code would not require huge changes.<\/p><p>Yes, they would probably require additional funding, but not huge changes.  We do not need committees set up.  We do not need research groups.  We do not need years and years to think about this.  We just need to look at it and ask whether it is right and how we can change it over.  Otherwise, we are talking about a snakes and ladders situation in which you manage to get in somewhere but something knocks you back and then you try to look at it from another angle and try to do something else and all your energy and time goes into doing things that should be straightforward.<\/p><p> Let us say you manage to get onto a third level course.  You have family support, get outside charity support and find a particularly flexible university that is able to cover your fees, with no living grants or other expenses, but you get in there part time.  Once in there, there is no top-up grant for people with disabilities, even though we know people with disabilities have higher living costs.  A research report launched just last December set out in definitive terms the higher cost of living people with a disability face just by existing.  It just costs us more.  It costs us more to travel and to get around the house.  We need extra supports.  Then, when we go back into education or training, we need more supports again.  Some of them are funded; some are not.  There is a need, therefore, for some level of matching top-up grant, especially for people with more extreme disabilities.<\/p><p> The third and last point I wish to make is about the fund for students with disabilities.  The name is a bit of a misnomer because it is not actually for the students but for the educational institutions to help them cater for the students.  The money goes into Trinity, UCD or DCU - I am in Dublin so all my examples are of Dublin institutions - and then the university decides how and when that money pays for supports for the individual students with disabilities.  That is all ifs, whens and maybes.  Nothing is guaranteed and it is all at the discretion of the university, so the fund is not necessarily based on the student's needs but on how well the student can negotiate.<\/p><p> I refer to simple things.  If you look at the small print for the fund for students with disabilities, you see lots of words like \"may\".  Students may ask for presentation overheads or lecture slides to be given in advance.  They may ask; they may not get them.  They may ask for this accommodation or that accommodation.  Again, there is no guarantee they will get it.  I hear of students having to ask three times for overheads in advance, not getting them for some time and, finally, getting them on the day of the lecture.  They need them to enlarge the font.  They need them to make them in some way more accessible.  That is a simple thing and it is not automatic.<\/p><p> Why are we still delivering education and training in such a way that students with disabilities must ask for accommodations?  Why are we putting the onus on the individual student to ask for these accommodations and to negotiate access to them?  Why is it that one student can go to the disability service in one university and get this type of assistive technology while another student in another university cannot get it?  People with disabilities can be told access is not possible and told to check with the students' union or the university head.  They can go back to the disability service and say it actually is possible, push a little and be difficult, and then they can get the support they need.  Why is that the case?  The whole way in which disability supports and services are delivered needs to be looked at.  To be fair to the disability services, they are very under-resourced, understaffed and overwhelmed.  Evaluation after evaluation has shown that, yet nothing is happening.<\/p><p> There are two sides to this.  The disability services need more money and more staffing to do what they do, but also the whole system needs to be focused on the student, not what the universities need to make accommodations.  The universities should be making these accommodations anyway.  There should be no need for accommodations.  One should not have to ask repeatedly for subtitles to be put on.  It is as if no level of disability-proofing goes into this.<\/p><p> I think I have kept within my five minutes and said everything I wanted to say.  Those are the three issues: the fact that all the funding, with the exception of one or two small cases, is full time; the way in which social welfare is set up, with no top-up grants; and the fund for students with disabilities.  It is a matter of small changes just to make things better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Kerry Lawless","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>On behalf of WALK, I thank the Chairperson and the members of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters for the opportunity for Gavin Gilvarry, a gentleman with lived experience of disability who overcomes daily barriers to achieve tremendous personal outcomes, which he will discuss with the committee later in his presentation, and me to present on the key issue of education.  I acknowledge and thank especially Senator Seery Kearney, a member of the committee, for the tremendous support she continually provides to WALK.<\/p> <p>  By way of a brief introduction to WALK, we are a progressive community and voluntary section 39 organisation that has been supporting people with intellectual disabilities and autism for more than 50 years.  We are based in Dublin and Louth and, as for education, we have developed and continue to deliver the innovative Providing Equal Employment Routes, PEER, programme.  The programme supports students with special educational needs to transition from special school to mainstream further education, training and employment.  The services and supports WALK provides are rights based and rooted in the belief that all people have the right to live self-determined lives in an equal and inclusive society.<\/p> <p>  In our engagement with the committee today we will focus on the topic of education.  We ask the committee to consider a more holistic and integrated approach to the achievement of equality in education.  If we are to make schools truly egalitarian institutions, we must consider the inclusive process for respecting differences not only in the culture of education but also in the curriculum, the pedagogy and the assessment systems that typically exclude people with intellectual disabilities from progressing on their pathway to lifelong learning.  Education has a significant impact on all our lives, and being educated opens doors for us.  Schools and colleges are major institutions of selection and stratification for the labour market.  Many people with an intellectual disability, however, leave school never having attained a QQI level 3, 4 or 5 standard of education.  This prompts us to ask what measures are in place to determine the standard of education a person with an intellectual disability receives.  The answer is \"None\".  It is perfectly acceptable for these people to leave school without any QQI qualification and transition into a life of services as opposed to a life in which they direct their own supports to achieve their educational, training and employment goals.<\/p> <p>  Some people whom WALK supports need additional accommodations to reach educational milestones.  For example, we have worked with one individual who left school with no educational qualifications and limited literacy skills.  He was, however, an extremely driven and capable individual who had not been given appropriate supports in school.  He had a dream: he wanted to work with children.  WALK supported him on his journey.  The first thing we looked at was paid work experience for one hour per week to decide if this was really what he wanted to do with his life.  It was, so he did a QQI level 3 course with support from a PEER mentor, which took him one year.  He then did a QQI level 4 course with support from WALK staff, which took two years, while also taking up a part-time job in a restaurant to support himself.  He then did a QQI level 5 course with support from WALK staff, which took him three years, while taking up a part-time job in a restaurant.  Then he took on a community employment, CE, scheme of 19.5 hours per week in childcare and has now commenced his QQI level 6 childcare course with support.  That is just one example of a very capable person who was let down very badly by the school educational system.<\/p> <p>  This raises two questions.  Who is monitoring the quality standard of education for children with an intellectual disability, and how is it acceptable for a child to leave school with no educational qualification?  We do not expect other children to leave school and commence a PhD immediately because we recognise that years of educational foundations are required before a person can reach that level of academic competence.  We have an educational pathway designed for this journey.<\/p><p>Why have we not designed an educational pathway through school for children with intellectual disabilities?  Would it not seem like the logical approach?<br\/><br\/>In our society, this inequality manifests itself as a problem of access, participation and outcome, arising from unequal distribution of resources, supports, accommodations, alternative learning options and, fundamentally, an institutionalised one-size-fits-all educational system.  If a student selects the mainstream path after leaving school, there is a massive gap to bridge in trying to access appropriate further education, because they all start at QQI level 5.  There is very little support to bridge the gap into the mainstream and, therefore, without a good educational foundation, children leave school with limited further education, training and career options.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThat people with [disabilities] shall have the same right to avail of, and benefit from, appropriate education ... to assist children with [disabilities] to leave school with the skills necessary to participate ... in an inclusive way in the social and economic activities of society and to live independent and fulfilled lives. <\/blockquote><p>However, as already outlined, the lived experience of people with an intellectual disability is contrary to this.<br\/><br\/>There is no provision for career guidance in our special schools or comprehensive transition planning for our young citizens with special educational needs that begins early enough to have a meaningful and positive influence on a young person&rsquo;s life choices and decisions.  Therefore, the educational foundation required for progression into mainstream that should begin in schools only begins, for the lucky ones, when they are young adults.<br\/><br\/>Training settings such as the WALKways programme that operates in Tallaght University Hospital and the Oireachtas work learning, OWL, programme that operates here in Leinster House provide a real and applied learning experience to the trainees in a busy work setting, to support the development of skill acquisition required to access paid employment in the open labour market.  Sadly, programmes such as this are extremely limited in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The distribution of economic resources plays a pivotal role in determining the quality of education a person receives and because education is such a powerful determinant of life chances, equality in education cannot be thought of separately from economic equality.  People with intellectual disabilities have a right to education.  With a view to realising this right without discrimination and based on equal opportunity, States parties are tasked to ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and lifelong learning.  I would like to introduce Gavin Gilvarry, who has kindly agreed to share his lived experience with us all here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I will tell the committee a little bit about my journey in education over the past few years, from when I left school up to where I am now.  When I left school, I was not sure what I wanted to do.  It was hard to find options to suit me and I felt a bit lost.  From 2016 to 2018, I did some Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, courses to try to develop my skills.  I did courses in career exploration and Microsoft Word and Excel.  It was good to try to do those courses, to continue my education and get started on the path to employment, but parts of the courses could be difficult.  They did not always suit my learning needs.<\/p> <p>  I also did some work experience placement but I was still finding it hard to know which way to turn.  My family have always been a great support to me and, outside of my family, I was looking for support with my further education and getting into a career.<\/p> <p>  From September 2018 to July 2019, I took part in the WALKways Tallaght University Hospital programme.  I got to do work experience, three placements in three different departments in the hospital; medical records, facilities management and in the warehouse.  In September 2019, I moved on to the OWL programme at Leinster House to continue with my skills development.  During my time on the OWL programme, I did work experience placement in the inquiries office and HR unit and remote working tasks for the Parliamentary Questions Office.<\/p> <p>  While we were doing our work experience placement on those programmes, we did classes during the week with the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire education and training board and the City of Dublin education and training board.  Each week, we would have two class sessions.  The classes we did were work experience and career preparation.  The classes were made in order that they were at the right level for everyone on the programme.  This meant all of us trainees could really learn the course work and put it to practice.<\/p> <p>  Our course work was related to the work we were doing in Departments and offices.  We would take what we learned in the class and use it in our work experience.  It was a helpful way to learn and provided me with the employment skills I needed to grow in confidence and take the next step.  I learned so much about the working world and I felt that I could learn at my own pace.<\/p> <p>  It also helped me to move the next stage, which was updating my CV, applying for a job and going for an interview.  In December 2021, I did my first big job interview for a job in the civil service and came first on the panel.  I hope to start working in a clerical role soon.  An important part of my journey was to learn at my own pace in a way that suited me.  I am so proud of what I have achieved and I have always known I am not in this world to do nothing.  I cannot wait to see what this new year brings me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Gilvarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Mr. McGinn and Ms Newman will now make their opening remarks.

It is a privilege to be here and I commend the committee on its work, since its inauguration, in highlighting issues that affect many people with disabilities in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I have been the chief executive of the Rehab Group for the past few years.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Bird, who is the director of the National Learning Network, NLN.  I am delighted to be joined by Ms Newman, who is in the committee room.  She is a former student of NLN and will share her personal experience with the committee.<br\/><br\/>The Rehab Group provides services for more than 10,000 adults and children <i>per annum<\/i>, and champions the values of diversity and inclusion for persons with disabilities or disadvantage in their communities, throughout Ireland.  We support people to live the lives they choose by providing care, education and meaningful employment opportunities.<br\/><br\/>The NLN is the education and training arm of the Rehab Group.<\/p><p>We deliver education and training services on behalf of the Government.  We offer four core education and training services, namely, bridging and transition services with the HSE on a national basis; specialist vocational training, including employer-based training, with the education and training boards, ETBs; education support services with higher education and some further education and training institutions; and individual placement and support services with the HSE mental health services in a number of locations across the country.  These services span inclusive education at all levels and support equity of access in education, lifelong learning, and employment for people with disabilities.  Through these services, every year we support between 6,000 and 7,000 people with a disability or a health-related support need, including school leavers and those who need a second chance at education.  We have 50 centres across the country, serving both urban and rural Ireland.  We are a pan-disability service.  Disability diagnosis is not so important.<\/p><p> As we know, disability affects people in different ways.  We meet people&rsquo;s needs and work to remove barriers to inclusion.  We work across age groups from 16 to 65.  People choose NLN because of the way we work to support them.  We adopt a rights-based approach in the delivery of our education and training services.  The guiding principles of the UNCRPD are inherent in the day-to-day delivery of our services and this was the case long before ratification of the convention.  Our approach to delivery is informed by the universal design for learning and we provide extensive wide-ranging holistic supports personalised to meet each student&rsquo;s needs.  These supports span psychological interventions, welfare supports, housing supports, money management and poverty alleviation, community inclusion activities, health and wellness.  All ensure that basic human rights are met.<\/p><p> Students are central in all our work.  Our recently published strategy, Delivering Our Future, states our intention to further enhance student involvement in consultation through co-design and co-production of future services.  All programmes at NLN, from level 2 to level 5, are accredited on the national framework of qualifications.  We are currently designing level 1 programmes to meet the needs of some young people who experience severe and profound disabilities and who are deferring day places.  We are impact focused.  Each year, approximately 500 of the students who complete their courses in levels 2 to 5 of rehabilitative training and specialist vocational training progress to employment and 950 progress to higher levels of further education and training or higher education.  This equates to over 90% positive outcomes for those who complete their education courses with us.<\/p><p> I will address some of the issues in delivering a right-based approach to education and training, based on our direct experience as a provider and the lived experiences of the people we support.  One of the main areas for improvement is the need for more formalised transition planning from second level to further and third levels for persons with disabilities.  There is a lack of comprehensive knowledge about post second-level training providers, including specialist provision like NLN, so students lose out on inclusive education and training opportunities because they simply do not know about them.  Another big challenge is the lack of career guidance in special schools.  This area is under-resourced and means students with disabilities do not get the chance to look fully at all their education and training options.  Another transition piece is the journey from training into employment.  This can be quite challenging for some and we have heard about that already this morning.  Post-training support would be a highly effective intervention and deserves consideration by the Government.  Significant changes are also required to the funding model to support the delivery of inclusive and flexible educational services.  A capital investment plan for infrastructure and technology-enhanced learning is also required.  Current provision must expand to cater for students with profound and severe disabilities who are leaving second level and who, for the first time, can defer their day service places and continue in education.  Provision needs to be authentic in meeting these students&rsquo; needs and available close to their vital family supports.<\/p><p> NLN is, therefore, proposing six areas that we believe would be impactful in aligning post second-level education with the UNCRPD.  Our first recommendation is to improve transition programme planning for persons with disabilities from second level, with appropriate levels of funding and upskilling for career guidance.  Second is investing in career guidance in special schools in order that students do not lose out.  Third, we should invest in post-training support services for people with disabilities exiting training into employment.  Fourth, we should put students&rsquo; needs first by ensuring informed choices for people with disabilities accessing education that suits their needs and preferences, whether that be mainstream or specialist, such as by promoting specialist services as part of the further education and training college of the future.  Our fifth recommendation is to deliver a capital investment programme and provide a multi-annual funding allocation model.  Finally, we should support the development of programmes for people with moderate, severe and profound disabilities who are deferring day places, and recognise these as vital for a more inclusive future.<\/p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to bring these matters to its attention.  The members would be most welcome to join us at any of our centres for a visit at any time.  We would be delighted to arrange that.  Ms Bird and I would happy to take questions.  I will now hand over to Ms Newman to share her personal experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry McGinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":729,"content":"<p>Dia dhaoibh a chairde.

I have an acquired brain injury, which happened when I fell off a horse in 2015.  I went head-first into a brick wall.  I had very serious head injuries and was airlifted to Beaumont Hospital where I was in a coma.  I was in hospital for a long time.  I could not walk, I could not talk and I could not move at all.  I relied on others for everything.  I could not continue in my job with Comhar Na&iacute;onra&iacute; na Gaeltachta because I was so bad.  My only income was from social welfare and I was very depressed.  I was lost.  At times I did not know where I would end up.  I thought my life had no meaning and I did not have a clue what I could do next.<\/p> <p>  Then someone told me about the NLN.  From the minute I heard about it, I felt it was something that would suit me.  If nothing else, it would get me out of bed, get me organised and encourage me to plan and have a social life again.  From the moment I walked in the door, I could see smiling, welcoming faces and I knew this was the right place for me.  My tutor, James Conroy, knew about the fatigue I suffered from and he chatted to me about it.  He gave me a chair by the door and told me that if ever I needed to get up and walk out to catch breath or get a cup of tea, I was more than welcome.  This gave me peace of mind and I knew then that this was right for me.  That little bit of understanding made all the difference.<\/p> <p>  In NLN, I studied IT and office skills.  I found it challenging at first but over time I rediscovered myself.  I grew in confidence and learned that I had something to offer.  I am happy to say that I now have a job at the reception of a local company.  What I have learned on my journey is that training services need to be supportive, understanding and approachable.  People must be able to take training at their own pace.  The social side of training, such as a smile, a conversation, a happy face, a coffee and making friends, was just as important as the certificate I got at the end of my course.  I also believe that there should be better support once people leave training.  A brain injury is for life so a bus pass or medical card should also be for life.  I have spoken to a lot of people about these issues.  I am happy to answer any questions the members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Wendy Newman"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":730,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.

I am here in my role as head of policy and practice in the NCSE.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Madeline Hickey, who is our specialist sensory lead.  Her role is to provide advice and support to students in our schools who are deaf or hard of hearing and students who are blind or have visual impairments.<\/p><p> The NCSE's vision is for an inclusive society where children and adults with special educational needs are supported to achieve better outcomes in their education to enable them to develop skills for life to participate to their fullest potential in society.  This vision is realised by activities that are set out by our functions identified in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  These functions include planning and co-ordinating educational supports for children and young people with special educational needs, conducting and commissioning research, and advising the Minister for Education on policy pertaining to special education.  The 2004 Act also identifies our role to review and advise on educational provision for adults with disabilities.  It is within the context of this function that we warmly welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee today about aligning education with the UNCRPD, to discuss topics that include life after school and transitioning from school to further education and-or employment for young people with special educational needs.<\/p><p> With Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UNCRPD, the NCSE recognises that, in its role, it will take time to support the development of a progressive realisation of an inclusive educational system.  The UN acknowledges that significant change takes time to implement.  Article 24 recognises the right of persons with disabilities to education, to provide for an inclusive education system at all levels and to support lifelong learning opportunities that enables the development of each person with disabilities to their fullest potential.  This article also provides for the provision of reasonable accommodations to include effective individualised support measures consistent with the aim of full inclusion.  This includes the NCSE&rsquo;s role in supporting and advising on the provision for learning for students with disabilities, using various forms of communication, including ISL, and embedding the tenets of a universal design for learning approach.<\/p><p> The NCSE is supporting developments of an inclusive educational system in a number of ways.  In September 2019, the school inclusion model, SIM, a new pilot model of supports for schools, was established and it aims to build schools&rsquo; capacity to include students with additional educational and care needs in our schools.  The NCSE assists in the implementation of this model.  This capacity building model includes a joined-up thinking, wraparound support where teachers access the supports of therapists, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and behavioural practitioners, along with our colleagues in the National Educational Psychological Service.  This model enables capacity building in schools by raising awareness and understanding of the specific needs of our students with disabilities in our schools.<\/p><p> Along with this pilot, there is a fully-funded Department of Education training programme in University College Dublin for 3,500 special needs assistants who provide for the care needs of our students with disabilities.  The overall aim of this initiative is to assist in building an inclusive culture in our schools.  An evaluation of the first year of this therapy project identified the positive impacts of this project that included teachers&rsquo; acquisition of knowledge from engaging with therapists that enabled these teachers to identify the needs of students.  This included differentiation of instruction and creating more positive interactions in school settings.  However, notwithstanding the benefits of therapists in school settings, there have been challenges in accessing therapists in these roles due to the current shortage of available therapists.  The NCSE also provides funding for teachers to upskill in areas such as ISL, braille and access to postgraduate training in the areas of support for deaf or hard of hearing students or blind or vision impaired students in our schools.<\/p><p> We are in the process of finalising policy advice on the education provision for students in special schools and classes.  An interim progress report that informs this policy, published in 2019, outlined the view of the NCSE that all children should be educated together, with the appropriate supports in place, unless there is strong evidence to support the contrary.  The final report on this advice is scheduled for publication this year.<\/p><p> Under Article 7, the NCSE recognises the importance of capturing the voice of students in regard to their education.  Under Article 27, there is a requirement of the State to support the rights of persons with disabilities to work on an equal basis with others and to work in an environment that is open, inclusive and accessible for all persons with disabilities.  In response to this article, the NCSE has completed a number of initiatives.  These include guidelines for students with special educational needs and their parents or guardians, entitled &ldquo;Planning for Life After School&rdquo;, which supports the preparation and planning for students and their parents.  Topics in this document include further education and entering the workplace, as well as supports for students with high support needs.<\/p><p> We have also published two research reports to inform pathways for young adults.  Our research report No. 14, Moving to Further and Higher Education: An Exploration of the Experiences of Students with Special Educational Needs, provides information from focus groups that were interviewed to seek their views on the pathways for students with disabilities moving to further education.  This report examined the roles of the institutions involved, the supports that were available and the students&rsquo; experiences, issues and barriers, as well as best practice and strategies to support students transitioning to further and higher education.  Our research report No. 15 reviewed literature on what works in the provision of higher, further and continuing education, training and rehabilitation for adults with disabilities to assist adults with disabilities to participate in and progress from education, training and rehabilitation.  Key findings from this report included the necessity to set clear targets and objectives, identifying barriers and resolving these, and adopting an inclusive approach.  It was noted that legislation was not enough to ensure adequate provision and that staff training was also required.<\/p><p> The NCSE is also on a steering committee to support action 1.3 of the comprehensive employment strategy, the aim of which is to provide access to all school leavers requiring specialist supports to an appropriate transition programme.  Significant background work has been completed to develop this project and it is a priority project for education to address significant issues in regard to the provision of supports for young people with disabilities.  Notwithstanding the delays that have occurred as a result of Covid-19, the NCSE is looking forward to supporting this project and supporting the development of resources to assist young adults with intellectual disabilities in transitioning from our schools.<\/p><p> D&eacute;anfaimid gach iarracht na ceisteanna a fhreagairt anseo inniu agus is f&eacute;idir linn scr&iacute;obh chuig an gcomhchoiste tar &eacute;is an chruinnithe le heolas breise m&aacute;s mian leis.

That was such an informative discussion and very uplifting to hear some of the lived experiences.  However, as these committee meetings often do, it also raises quite a lot of questions and very valid concerns on policy issues that we, as a committee, take very seriously, want to have influence on and want to help to change.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the comment from Ms Newman that summed up a lot of what is wrong with our system.  A brain injury is for life.  A bus pass and a medical card should also be for life.  Ms Newman could not have put it any more simply and in any more practical terms than that.  We need to see how we can modernise and update our systems so we are not putting people under annual or biannual pressure to complete forms, with the extra administration and extra hassle, in order to answer questions that are blatantly obvious to anybody who is looking at them.<\/p><p>I appreciate that much of the time, computers are doing the work and scanning the information in but someone looking at it can tell.  We need to take some of that humane way in which a person would deal with an application and try to incorporate it into our technologies, processes and systems.  In my view, that is absolutely critical.<\/p><p> It was really interesting to hear of Ms Lawless's experience.  Many people receive diagnoses later in life and it can be difficult for people to come to terms with their diagnosis at that point.  It is more important than anything, therefore, that we provide the assistance and support they need.<\/p><p> Ms Lawless clearly outlined some of the challenges in that regard, as did Mr. Gilvarry, who talked about the fantastic support he received from WALK to enable him to fulfil his full potential.  One can see quite clearly how bright and articulate Gavin is and that he has a bright future ahead of him.  It is critical to understand not just the benefits that organisations like WALK bring but also the challenges they help people overcome.  It is great that organisations like WALK are there to overcome and break down those challenges but would it not be great if the system did not have them in the first place.  I am interested in hearing, perhaps from Ms Kelly, about what we could do to enable that transition to be better.  Perhaps she will also indicate whether individuals can transition to her service instead of a day service because that was not clear to me.<\/p><p> My next question is for Ms Lawless, who spoke about assistive technology.  It is something we discuss week in, week out at this committee.  We hear stories of how assistive technology is sometimes only available in one sector of employment, and that it is a little bit easier to obtain from a private sector perspective if a person is working in the private sector as opposed to the public sector.  I was interested and even concerned to hear that Ms Lawless had to negotiate to get it into her university.  I would love to learn a little more about that and what processes and policy changes she thinks we could introduce that could change that for other people in that situation.<\/p><p> I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who spoke.  I only have five minutes so I cannot pose a question to everybody.  The three witnesses might perhaps respond to those questions.

I thank the Deputy very much for her comments.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about how we can improve the transition from schools to WALK, we are looking at the special schools.  It was very welcome to hear Ms Prendeville's news from the NCSE.  One of the programmes we operate in counties Louth and Dublin is to provide support to people in special schools from the age of 15 years until they leave.  We do a career guidance programme with them on their careers and where they are going.  We also look at where they are on the FETAC scale and what qualifications they require.  We need asking how is it okay for somebody to leave school without any QQI qualification and, where this happens, what we are doing wrong.  It is really and truly about providing the appropriate supports and accommodations to enable people to follow that trajectory in their school education.  The foundation of that is important for people.  We all know that the foundation of education determines where we go in our lives.  Not having that in place can be a real barrier for people.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of people coming to WALK, some years ago, we ran a traditional day service.  We had to take a look at ourselves, which is great because it is all about reflecting to see if what we are doing is actually appropriate for the people we are supporting.  We saw that people were coming into our services but we asked ourselves when they were leaving whether they were really contributing in society.  Were they being supported to be as independent as possible?  Were they living their own lives?  We had to conclude that they were not and we completely changed what we do.  Now we do not deliver the services but provide supports that are appropriate for people.  People like Gavin come and tell us what they wants in their lives.  Then we see how we can support them or ask what they need from us to achieve what they want in life and we look at how we do that.  It is not a one-size-fits-all approach.  It is about what is appropriate for the person and how we can support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Does Ms Lawless wish to make a comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#G00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Assistive technology and I are perhaps not the best fit.  In terms of this issue, again, I can only talk about my experience.  I think the committee needs to talk to a wider group of students at third level, particularly at postgraduate level.<\/p> <p>  For me, the issue is quite basic.  I have been out of the workforce for quite a while.  Things have moved on.  Yes, I can manage a computer and use Microsoft Word but there are a lot of basic skills I do not have and there is a presumption at third level that people have these skills.  However, there is no provision to bridge that gap.  If I was to meet the assistive technology officer in the disability services of a university, I would be told this and that is available, look at this app or YouTube video and do this and that.  I would have no idea what they were talking about.  I am more than capable in my area, which is science and health communications.  I am more than capable of doing things like that but I do not know how to operate much of the assistive technology.  The disability services do not necessarily have the funding for the staff to give me the sort of support and training I need to bring me from where I am to where the supports are available.  That is one big issue.  There can be issues when someone tries to access those supports.<\/p> <p>  I am not making this up, in case anyone thinks I am, but I had this conversation yesterday.  I found a part-time course in my local area of Finglas in Dublin 11 to do basic IT and improve my skills.  I am on the invalidity pension so there are no fees.  It is very hard to find these part-time courses because, again, even at FETAC levels 4, 5 and 6, they tend to be full-time.  The course had already started and I asked if I could go along.  The answer was \"Yes\" but I was told the only seats they had available were at the back and asked if that was a problem for me.  I said it would be a problem because I have visual and hearing issues and asked if there was any way I could sit at the front.  I was told all the seats at the front were gone and that I would have to wait until September.  I asked whether we could change the seats around and see if somebody was willing to move for me.  The person to whom I was speaking was a very nice, helpful woman.  She was not being difficult.  She told me that they had set up the seating, everybody's work was on his or her computer and the only seats available were at the back of the room.  She asked why I was not put down for the course in September.  I am not particularly IT literate but even I know it is a 15-minute job to take somebody's work off a computer, keep it clean, protect the person's privacy and transfer it to another computer.<\/p> <p>  If people are coming up against those sorts of barriers, how on earth are we expected to survive at third level, again with apps and so forth?  That is one area in which there is an institutional and cultural issue.  There is an expectation when someone says \"reasonable accommodations\" but they are not actually that reasonable at all.<\/p> <p>  The second point I mention is that if a student in a university is looking for higher tech assistive technology, the particular third level institution may or may not have the funding for it.  It varies widely.  Other people will have different issues but for me, the biggest issue is that I need to bridge the gap, even for the IT that is there.  I need someone to show me how to use it.  It is no good telling me I have been set up on a transcribing service and off I go.  They may as well be giving me a JCB and telling me to get in and drive it away.  I am more likely to get on the JCB and give it a go but I am not going to do that with transcribing.<\/p><p>Again, that this is all negotiated is a huge issue for me.  I was told at one stage I was not entitled to a scribe to help with, say, assignments, writing funding applications or research ethics.  I was only entitled to a scribe to work on my thesis.  Again, I thought: \"What?  Is writing not writing?\".  If I need support with writing, does it matter what element of writing it is as part of the academic programme?  When you do a postgrad or PhD, you do not only write a thesis.  You write to get research ethics.  You write to submit papers and hope to get them published.  You write funding applications.  You write emails and updates and you give presentations.  However, I was told the scribe was only available for the actual words that were going to go into my thesis.  As members can tell, I am fairly mouthy and fairly able to stand my ground, and yet I was asking \"What?\".  Luckily, I happened to know another PhD student who said that is not true at all and that I should go back to them and say A, B and C.  You have to go back and say A, B and C because the system is set up that you are looking for reasonable accommodations and you are negotiating every part of it.  That includes something as simple as automated transcription and a scribe.<\/p><p> It should just be that for what students need, they ask for it, prove their eligibility for it, get it and get trained in how to use it.  It should not be this way where every single student has to negotiate for every single thing.  I am sure other people have stories of how easily it worked, how well it worked for them and how all their needs were met, but my couple of examples are of how easy it is for things not to work.  It should not be like that.  As I said, these are simple changes that could be made about how the fund for students with disabilities is set up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kerry Lawless","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":740,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lawless.

I especially thank Ms Kelly, Ms Lawless and Ms Newman for sharing their lived experiences with us.  I commend all the organisations, namely, WALK, National Learning Network and the NCSE, for the work they do as well.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about education and further education and training and we have referenced Article 24 of the UNCRPD, which is around inclusive education.  When I speak to parents of children with additional needs about inclusive education, they get very fearful because they think their child with an additional need is going to be sent into mainstream school and not have the supports he or she needs.  We are all nervous about our children starting school, whether it is primary or secondary school especially, but if he or she has an additional need and you feel the supports are not there, you feel extra nervous about it.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in our guests' vision of inclusive education and how that can be achieved.  We are hearing about many students with intellectual disabilities leaving school without qualifications, so we obviously do not have inclusive education.  We do not have an education system that works if students are leaving second level without any qualifications and are having to pursue other avenues to obtain one.  It is proven that, with the proper supports, they are very capable of obtaining the qualifications and moving on.<\/p> <p>  I am very interested in the school inclusion model Ms Prendeville referenced and ask that she expand on that.  I think it is a pilot programme at the moment.  The new progressing disability services model is being rolled out.  We are hearing supports are being taken out of special schools.  Speech and language therapists, occupational therapists or psychologists are being removed from where they have always been before, that is, supporting the students.  Parents are very annoyed because this is being done without a risk assessment.  The students with very complex needs are especially nervous because they feel there is a real danger to them in this being done.  By contrast, Ms Prendeville is talking about a system where we are putting therapists into schools to support students in schools.  That is an excellent model.  I am aware there is a difficulty there with front-line healthcare workers in that there are not enough of them and that needs to be looked at and planned for.  What we are seeing now is students have to be taken out of school and brought to a service.  That is when the services get up and running and provision is being given, which is not happening at the moment, but we are hoping it will.  It means removing a student from a school for perhaps hours in a day, whereas if the services were available in the school, he or she could receive them there.<\/p> <p>  When the therapists are working with the teachers, the teachers are learning as well.  Teachers in particular must have disability training as part of their teaching programme and that is not happening.  It is very limited.  I come from an educational background so I know it is not given.  Many teachers and parents will tell you that while many teachers in a school will do their utmost to support their students, not all of them do.  Some of them have very archaic attitudes.  Training is, therefore, very important.  Training for employers is very important because many of us, as a witness said last week, are not familiar with disability.  How do we get familiar with it?  We do so by having disabled people in our schools, our workplaces and so on but we cannot do that until people are willing to have the training and to open up and accept people.<\/p> <p>  The cost of disability has been mentioned again.  The Indecon report published before Christmas indicated the cost of disability is anywhere between &euro;9,500 and &euro;12,000.  Ms Lawless mentioned the lack of flexibility to pursue courses in college that might take a someone with a disability longer than someone without one.  There is also the fact there is no top-up grant, and the fear of losing the disability payment and the secondary entitlements is another issue that must be tackled.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned a good few things there.  The presentations were excellent and I would love to hear further comments on what I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#H00400","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":743,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Tully for all those comments.  She certainly covered an awful lot so I will do my best to respond to them in the order she made reference to them, if that is okay.  First of all, we in the NCSE are very much looking forward to launching our policy advice.  It is at an advanced stage of development so it will be forthcoming in the next few months.  As I mentioned in the opening statement, the NCSE has a vision of an inclusive educational system and recognise it is going to take time to have that progressive realisation of a fully inclusive system.  The Deputy brought up some interesting comments and it is great she is coming from the perspective of teachers because, certainly, when you are on the ground and you see what is happening in schools, you have a very real sense of what is going on.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy first mentioned progressing disability services and its national roll-out.  We do not have a role in that.  It is a matter for the Minister for Health and his colleagues with regard to how that is progressing and the changes to the provision of supports in special schools we have.<\/p> <p>  On the school inclusion model, the first iteration of that was a demonstration project where we worked in tandem with our colleagues in the Department with responsibility for children, the HSE and the Department of Education to pilot a project where therapists were working in early years settings and in our schools to support that model of practice.  The first iteration of that was early years settings and primary and post-primary and special schools in 75 early years and 75 school settings.  There was an initial report done on that which I referenced in my opening statement.<\/p><p>It was certainly very well received.<\/p><p> Then we had Covid and therapists from the HSE were removed from the schools because they had to address front-line issues that were cropping up so the project was paused and it had to reviewed with regard to moving forward from the recommendations of that early demonstration project, how it could be embedded and the school inclusion models developed as a result.  That project was paused.  We have had difficulties accessing therapists for this project simply because there are not enough therapists qualifying and on the ground to be able to fill these posts so that would be the concern across health and education.  Our therapists and behavioural practitioners return to school in October of this year in collaboration with our NEPS colleagues.  Obviously, the data has not yet been gathered on this but we have been told in schools that in respect of the early supports they had prior to the project being paused, when teachers went back into schools, they were still using and embedding those supports and it really demonstrated on the ground that this capacity building model is working very well in schools.  For example, our therapy colleagues have developed a sensory spaces booklet, which is being disseminated to all primary schools, and also provided supports to post-primary schools around movement breaks to address the sensory needs of students.  Those practices have continued and are being very much embedded.  The early experiences of teachers having access to therapists to build capacity in the schools have been very positive to date and have been very much welcomed in schools and teachers are very open to that support.<\/p><p> It is important for the Deputy's constituents' wider community to recognise that the building capacity model means the NCSE and its colleagues in education develop a knowledge base and understanding of disabilities and schools via teachers and teacher professional learning initiatives.  Teachers work in collaboration with SNAs to support the care needs of very high-needs students and ensure they are embedded.  It is not about therapists working directly with students.  I mean the therapists in the NCSE - speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and behavioural practitioners.  Our colleagues in NEPS still work on a one-to-one basis with students, which is different.  It is really important that people recognise that.  Research has demonstrated that capacity building models have a far greater long-term impact on students compared with the one-to-one therapy approach.  I know that is a mindset that needs to change over time because we recognise that we can reach and support a higher number of students across the entire system not just students who have disabilities.  This benefits all students with a school community to build an inclusive culture in our schools.  This is something that is really important for us to recognise.<\/p><p> The philosophy of embedding a universal design approach, which was raised by other speakers today, is very important to the work of building capacity.  It involves looking at spaces in schools and being creative, open and supportive around that to ensure our students are supported as much as possible within the school space.  I am not sure if the Deputy has any other questions that address the main issues she raised with me earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Prendeville","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":745,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy Tully on the question of vision, from our presentation, she will have seen that NLN and the Rehab Group operate within the mainstream and a specialist setting.  Our vision would be to promote access to education for all people with disabilities.  We envisage a model where all of the needs of people with mild, moderate, severe and profound disabilities can be met within an overall education ecosystem with mainstream provision, student support services and specialist training for people who need higher levels of support.<\/p> <p>  In my presentation, I alluded to an example of the further education and training, FET, college of the future, which is something our colleagues in SOLAS and the ETBs have been taking from page to stage over the past 18 months since the launch of the FET strategy.  That model envisages multi-campus delivery with effectively one front door albeit virtually.  From our point of view, segmenting services as one thing or the other does not serve anybody.  Many of the concerns that have been expressed here today have been around transitioning and moving - whether that is from secondary to post-secondary or training to employment.  This suggests that we have a good bit of work to do in respect of achieving this seamless movement.  The model should be that there is a level of need that is met by different agencies or organisations at different times and in different ways with some people requiring more intensive support at certain times and later being able to progress to less support or different forms of support over time.  That would be our vision for the FET space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry McGinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I return to the point Deputy Tully raised about the financial side of it.  It is significant and it is significant for anyone with a disability at any level trying to get back into education.  The Deputy mentioned the report released last year that showed the disability tax - that every single part of our lives costs us extra.  The more profound the disability is, the more it costs.  I am quite fortunate in that I live in Dublin and want to attend a university there.  However, even though I live in Finglas and DCU is the university I attend, getting the bus there from Finglas south is quite a big deal.  It takes quite a while, walking is involved and if you want to do it more quickly, you have to change bus so it is much easier for me to drive.  The cost to all of us of trying to keep a car on the road is high.  Try doing that with a disability payment and when you have been in receipt of one for over a decade.  You do not have the resources or savings, are struggling day to day and then have these extra expenses.  There is no provision anywhere in the system such as through the community welfare officer.<\/p> <p>  This is true for people with disabilities going back into work as well.  If we are honest and if we want people with a disability or multiple disabilities to get back into training at whatever level and to be able to re-enter the labour market, we must recognise those additional costs.  I spent two months last month trying to attend university remotely on my phone because I dropped my 12-year-old laptop and this time there was no resurrecting it.  It was gone.  It took me two months.  In the end, I did manage to find a little pocket of funding and get a laptop but it took weeks to do that.  That was it because I do not have the resources.  I am very advantaged in many ways but I do not have the financial resources or that family support for things like laptops, the type of phones you need, the apps and other stuff you need.  They are not covered.  Again, if we are looking at people with disabilities who also have economic disadvantage and come from low-income areas or personal situations, we must be realistic.  Unless there is a top-up grant and we provide certain things as a given, it is all just nice words.<\/p> <p>  It is a little bit like the assistive technology I spoke about.  We are saying all these things are over here but you need to take these four steps to get there and we are not going to help you with those four steps.  There is a presumption within all the social welfare models I have ever used for disability that you have a family that supports you and that you are not a full-grown adult who has been living on your own and supporting yourself for quite a while.  The presumption is that people have families that will come in and make up for the gaps that are there.  We are going to find more and more people like me who have acquired disabilities - people who survive terrible falls and brain injuries such as those we heard about today or the type of illness I got.  Hopefully, more of us are going to survive and live for longer.<\/p><p>We want full and meaningful lives.  Education is part of that but we need the Government to give us the social capital and resources we need to access it.  It is a little bit like that cartoon that we all know, where all the different animals are asked to climb a tree.  One is an elephant, another is a monkey and they are all saying that it is an equal opportunity and everyone just has to climb that tree there.  We need a little bit of honesty and we are either willing to recognise the disability tax and the fact that it costs us more to live and increase the social welfare supports accordingly, or we are not.  To be quite honest, we then need to stop with all of the aspirational talk.  We are either serious about allowing and helping people with disabilities to access education and giving them the extra resources that they need, or, again, we are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kerry Lawless","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lawless.

We need to look at the beliefs and attitudes that exist around people with disabilities within the school and how we support them.  Until we do that and do a piece of change management and really nail what the culture which we expect is, that change will not happen.<\/p> <p>  We also have many pilot schemes in schools.

There are two things I wish to speak about. One is the bus pass and the second is the difference for me monetarily now that I am working and have a job.<\/p> <p>  On the bus pass issue, before my accident I drove everybody everywhere and it was my independence, even if it was just to go out into the car and turn on Radio Nova, to have a singsong and get away from everybody.  This is what I did.  That took away my independence.  Before I got my bus pass, as I said, I was transporting everybody.  <\/p> <p>  When I had my accident, however, I was not able to drive and was relying on everybody.  When people were dropping children to school, we had to take time out and do a rota for me so that I could get a lift to get to the places that I needed to go to and I was dependent on everybody.  I had such joy when I got my bus pass.   This is my key to the outdoor world and I do not have to ask anybody.  It did not come easily at all and I had to go through a great deal of paperwork to prove many things.  I had to pay doctors &euro;50 just to sign a form, money I had to borrow.  My ask is to please make the bus pass available for life.  I am going to have my disability for life and this will make my life easier but the main thing is that I will have peace of mind.<\/p> <p>  Second, the NLN gave me the initiative and the help to go out to get a job.  This was a delight and the people in the area that I work in are all understanding, reasonable and just lovely people.  They would do anything for you.  When I got my first pay cheque, what did the Government do?  It did not take all but it took a big chunk of my money in tax.  I am not sure why this was so or where to go to find out why.  At the Citizens Information bureau, one goes in, gets a ticket and is waiting for hours and that does not help.  <\/p> <p>  I also lost my invalidity pension just like that.  I got a letter before my first week was over informing me that it was being taken off me.  I was happy because I know now that I do not have to get my bus pass renewed until 2025.  That gives me some time but the money I have in my pocket was greater when I was on the invalidity pension than it is when I am working now.  The real reason I am working is for my mental health.  I can get out and socialise.  When Covid-19 was going on, I was in the NLN doing a course with the wonderful James Conroy and was socialising with people.  <\/p> <p>  He sorted out where we were broken into two groups.  One group worked from home on Mondays and Tuesdays and the other group worked in the office on Wednesdays and Thursdays and we mixed it up in that way, which was very good.

There is a presumption that once you get to third level you would not need it.  We know that people with disabilities in third level the figures from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, AHEAD, show that they are increasing but when you look into it the figures are increasing because more people are identifying with dyslexia, which I also have, and getting accommodations for that, which I have had.  That is out of proportion with other disabilities so in a way this welcome increased in reporting of students with dyslexia is overshadowing the fact that other areas like visual and hearing impairments and mobility issues are not increasing at that same level.  When you look at figures for postgraduate students with disabilities the numbers have fallen.  The figures were not high and they were unrepresentative in the first place but the numbers are falling in the most recent figures I have seen.  That is because the tailored level of services is not available.  The educational institutions need funding for their disability services.  I am not talking about taking from one area and giving to another.  I question why any course is being delivered that needs accommodations for people with disabilities to take part because at this stage those accommodations should be built in at third level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kerry Lawless"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I want to ask a follow-up question.

I am not sure who wants to take this; it might be for Ms Kelly or Mr. McGinn.  Mr. McGinn mentioned formal transition planning processes in his opening statement.  Based on the conversation we are having this morning I wonder whether he is talking about further education, vocational training or higher education.  There is a version of this which is almost like an educational care plan where the person is tracked and the funding more specifically follows the person than it has done so far.  Would anybody like to speak to the idea that we would have a full plan for each person as he or she moves through particular education access points?  Does that have a meaning for the likes of personal budgets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#L01100","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I want to comment on the previous mention of pace.  It is really important that there is flexibility in the timelines, the duration and the way people get the opportunity to learn.  We describe the NLN as classrooms within a classroom so that every person learns in his or her own way at his or her own pace.  Another point is continuous intake and being able to join a programme when you are ready to do so.  I was taken by Ms Lawless&rsquo; comments earlier on and a lot of people need to be able to join when they are ready to do so, which is a feature of the service we provide.  Flexible and student-centric approaches to learning, breaking things down and making the supports available at the right time and in the right place in the person&rsquo;s life are all critically important.  Needs are diverse and responses have to be diverse to be able to meet those needs.<\/p> <p>  Flexibility of funding is critical and that has come up a number of times.  There are rigid criteria set around funding at further educational level, whether that is the progression to HSE-funded services or the specialist vocational training provided within the FET sector at the moment, there are rigid criteria around allocation, utilisation and funding models that do not really allow enough flexibility to be built into the system and the service.  That is something that can be looked at.  We have raised it with the funders and we are in discussions with them.  When some changes are brought about there will be opportunities for change, innovation and new ways of developing services to be discussed and put on the table.<\/p><p> The idea of the educational plan is what we were speaking to in the transitional comments Mr. McGinn made at the beginning.  People should have a pathway through the education system, from second level into further education and training, FET.  There should also be combined funding models that would combine care and HSE-type supports with educational supports funded through the FET sector.  It is very important at that level, as is having a plan to go through that meets the needs of a very diverse population of people.  It is not all about one group of people.  We deal with people with intellectual, physical and sensorial disabilities.  We deal with a very large number of young people who have high anxiety levels and who are not able to function socially in their communities.  We deal increasingly with people with autism.  This needs, therefore, a broad and flexible range of responses to be able to ensure every young person with a disability or with a significant health condition has access to further education and training and, through that, can build his or her pathway to higher education.<\/p><p> The comments about supports in higher education that Ms Lawless has made are pertinent.  Our support services in higher education are supplementing gaps in existing provision.  These can be, could be and, I am sure, will be grown to be a lot stronger.  However, they really are highlighting the gaps in services that exist.  I would emphasise the points that have been made on the basis of my experience.  People need an awful lot of support to know how to use the systems, to get to the systems and to navigate their way through the systems.  They are incredibly difficult.  They are incredibly challenging.  People are exhausted.  I would say service providers are exhausted trying to navigate the system.<\/p><p> My appeal would be for flexibility in the funding.  Personalised funding is a slightly different concept from personalised budgets and I would support both of them.  We need to speak about diversity of provision.  We have very diverse needs and we therefore need diversity of provision.  Mainstream and inclusive does not negate the need for specialist.  It is not one versus the other.  Both are needed in a twin-track model, which is recommended by the UN, and this is the way forward for a progressive society.  Ms Prendeville&rsquo;s comments about progressive realisation is very pertinent.  There is a long way to go and there is a huge amount of capacity to be built within the system.  There are elements within the system that are powerful, strong and effective.  Looking at how that existing capacity within the system can be further utilised and maximised is important.  For instance, specialist training provision is part of the FET system but it is never promoted and it is never branded.  It is actually one of the most difficult areas on which to find out information at the moment.  We are told in NLN that we are one of the best kept secrets in Ireland.  That should not be the case.  The information and the knowledge should be there.  People should be able to access the services much more easily and to navigate their way through the systems much more easily.<\/p><p> Those are my comments.  I am very heartened by the debate and by the range of comments.  Recognising that diverse responses are required is critically important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#L01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lucianne Bird","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Hourigan.  What I am hearing from everyone, and what our experience is, is that while this is about transitions, there are no alternative pathways in place for people with intellectual disabilities or disabilities.  The systems, of which Ms Bird spoke very eloquently, are an absolute nightmare to navigate.  When somebody comes to us with a dream, we have to try to figure out how we can support him or her and how we navigate the system so that he or she can achieve that dream.<\/p> <p>  An example of this was in 2018, when we supported a person with an intellectual disability.  For the first time, a person with an intellectual disability went to TU Dublin to do his degree course.  However, for him to do that, he needed a basic level of education.  The only way we could navigate it was because I am an associate lecturer with TU Dublin.  It was through my relationships that we were able to work together with the university to figure out alternative pathways.  Ms Lawless spoke about support in terms of accommodations.  In the case of this individual, for every four hours he did in the class, he needed someone to support him for 12 hours so that he could begin to understand the concepts that were being discussed within the classroom.  However, he was willing to put all of that time in.  He brought huge diversity to the classroom.  The person skills and the social skills people in the class learned from him were unbelievable.  He overcame all of the barriers and we overcame all of the systems with him so that he could finish his degree.  However, that was done on a relationship basis.  Every time someone else comes to us and that is their dream, we have got to go and navigate it again.  It is nearly like we are asking for concessions.  What we actually need are alternative pathways.  They need to be developed.<\/p> <p>  On the Oireachtas work and learn, OWL, programme, the Civil Service has done a huge amount of work to develop alternative pathways for people on the OWL programme into the Civil Service and into employment and careers there.  If it can be done through that system, it can certainly be done through every system in Ireland.  Until that happens, people will be coming with their cap in hand, asking people for an opportunity when, in fact, it is a right people have.  Our responsibility becomes to develop alternative pathways for them.  As Ms Bird said, we as service providers are exhausted from begging for these pathways to be opened.  If they were there, the work we could do, the supports and accommodations we could provide, and the dreams and goals people have to be contributing within society, which is what most people want, could be realised and achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>Like other political colleagues, I have been enlightened by listening to the witnesses this morning.  I compliment each and every one of them for their presentations.  To Mr. Gilvarry, all I can say is that was wonderful.  I am not trying to pick out anybody over anybody else, but he did so well and I think everybody will agree with that.  I thank everyone for making their comments today.<\/p> <p>  One thing that has always been a concern to me is the way we in this country have treated people with dyslexia.  Many a person has had a sad life, sitting in the corner of their house and never getting out to a job because of the way society treated dyslexia.  The reality is many people went to school and they could not do their books.  Their teachers gave out to them.  Their parents gave out to them.  They were told they were lazy, that they did not want to work or to get on.  The truth was, however, they had a problem with reading and writing.  I am glad to see there is now more of a focus on dyslexia.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to see, now that we are putting so much emphasis on apprenticeships, that where there might be students who have dyslexia, it would be brought up by teachers, lecturers and politicians so that the issue of dyslexia would be on the programme and brought into the arena for discussion rather than people being frightened to talk about it.  Having said that, I notice that parents and teachers are very good nowadays at establishing why a child might not like school or why he or she is afraid to speak.  Sometimes it is an issue of dyslexia, but in the past it was treated in the wrong way.  This is not to say all teachers and all parents did it.  Many teachers spotted situations where the issue was that a person could not read or write properly.<\/p> <p>  We now have World Dyslexia Awareness Day.  We have more discussion about it.<\/p><p>Some of the most intelligent people I have ever met are dyslexic.  When I speak to groups, I sometimes give the example of when I had a summer job in my cousin's shop.  A couple who used to come in would buy hardware, groceries and so on and they would pay by cheque.  It was one of these country stores with everything.  They used to ask me to fill out the cheque for them, with their name and the sum, and they would then sign it.  You would not know from looking at how the signature had been scribbled that something was not right.  It was only years later that I found out that dyslexia affected both of them, and they were two of the most intelligent people I have ever met, and very successful people.<\/p><p> Much has been said about education during this meeting.  The same model of education does not fit every case.  What level of engagement are our guests' groups having with the Department of Education?  Is it an ongoing process?  Are they fighting for more of something?  If there is an ongoing discussion, is any progress being made?  If we as politicians were to ask them for one quick change that could be made to address some of the problems they have highlighted, that is, if the Department could come on board and make one quick change, what would it be?  What could be done quickly to improve matters?<\/p><p> I again thank our guests for a very good and important engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#M00500","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I wanted to add to the point other people were making about exhaustion.  Ms Newman mentioned paying a GP &euro;50 or &euro;60 to sign a form.  I used to work for the Irish Trade Union Trust and the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, so I know my way around this system.  If I am exhausted, how exhausted are people who are further distanced again, who do not know the system and did not know it before they acquired a disability, and whose families were not connected?<\/p> <p>  To respond to the Senator's point about dyslexia, we all think in different ways and have different talents.  I got my dyslexia diagnosis in my 30s, when I was working, and I paid for it privately.  That is the reality for most adults with dyslexia or any other sort of neurodiversity.  To get access to the supports, you need a diagnosis, and to get the diagnosis, very often you have to pay privately.  There are still people, therefore, with reading and writing difficulties, whether dyslexia or ADHD, who have those issues but have no way of proving that, so they cannot access the services.  This financial barrier is in place.  For example, I needed a letter from an ear, nose and throat, ENT, doctor to confirm my hearing impairments.  I spent four years waiting in the public system.  If I had been an undergraduate, I would have had to go through my entire degree without that piece of paper that confirms my impairment, which would have meant I could not have gotten the supports and services on offer because I could not afford to go private to get the letter that confirmed my diagnosis or to get the tests that led to that diagnosis.  All of this has to be reconsidered.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether there is one quick fix.  Other people are better qualified to answer that question than I am, but for me it relates to social welfare.  It should be a matter of building in flexibilities, recognising that people with disabilities have higher costs of living, letting them retain their payments and secondary benefits and letting them get back to education, training and employment.

In fact, we need to be mainstreaming the access to everything at all times.  This committee meeting has been super.  It has been a great experience for me to listen and hear people explain how that ableist privilege is experienced by people in not having the reasonable accommodation built-in in advance.<\/p><p> We need pathways to all levels of education.  I hear loud and clear the cost of living with disabilities and the fact that people have additional expense.  I am appalled by Ms Newman's experience and I am grateful to her for sharing it.<\/p><p> Returning to the NCSE, my home constituency of Dublin South-Cental has a multitude of schools where there is no place for a child with a disability to go into and that have no special classes.  Parents, even if they are trying to access the schools that have special classes, are given a list by a special educational needs organiser, SENO.  They are not really supported.  They are given a list and told to go off and do it themselves while they are perhaps caring for and trying to support and encourage their children into education.  If their children get into education at primary level, there is no guarantee that there is a follow-on to secondary school.  That has to be fought for tooth and nail by parent after parent.  I was taken by Ms Kelly's point that when they have a person with an ambition for a particular thing, they are asking for concessions.  The parents in groups such as Involve Autism would say that their daily life is about that arguing for concessions rather than entitlement.<\/p><p> I suppose I would welcome the opportunity to hear about the inadequacies of the section 37 process.  Is there someone on the NCSE board with disabilities because the committee's motto, which is also that of all those who we hear, is that there should be nothing about us without us?  I would be anxious to hear that.  We cannot aspire to third level and post-secondary if the basics of a full schooling experience are not experienced.  We have people who are looking at a primary or secondary school directly across the road from them in their home communities and yet they have to travel miles to go to a different one.  I encounter the outrage of that on a daily basis.  It is something I would love to see us solve.<\/p><p> I could be on this soapbox for a long time such is the rage that I experience from parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#N01000","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Seery Kearney for her comments.  From the NCSE's perspective, we absolutely recognise the challenges that families have in her constituency with regard to accessing places.  In relation to our policy advice, we would recognise that every child should be entitled to access local schools in their local communities, and that accessing those schools in the communities means they are part of the community and everybody has an awareness of their need.  It is very much the case that they should get the supports in their own environment.<\/p> <p>  We have SENOs on the ground.  I appreciate the Senator speaking about the dissatisfaction in south Dublin with regard to school placements.  We have made inroads in that space.  As recently as yesterday, two senior Ministers opened a new school - Our Lady of Hope School, which caters for children with significant needs in that area.  Notwithstanding that, there is still a significant need for placements for children in schools.  At cross-sectoral level, they are mapping the need for placements, not only for September but in the upcoming years, so that at least within the Department of Education we are mapping those supports and requirements and planning on the long-term basis.<\/p> <p>  The matter of opening schools and opening special classes in schools is a matter for each board of management.  I am aware that there are SENOs who are continuously engaging with schools in seeking those supports and accessing and asking boards of management to open places for children.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that there will be places for all students that we currently know about for September and the subsequent years.  What is happening, however, is that when classes open in schools and parents go into the schools to seek those places - we recognise this as an organisation because when parents contact us directly to say they are living in a certain area and they are looking for support, our SENOs would be aware that there are places available - it turns out that some of those places end up being taken up by students who are currently in the school.  The allocation of those places is a matter for the boards of management and school principals.  Even though the planning is done, when it comes to mapping out the children who get access to those classes, some of those places are taken up by students who are already in the system.  Due to data protection, etc., we cannot turn around and ask schools in advance how many of their current students will access those classes so that we will have knowledge and awareness of the students who will need the support in those schools.  I clarify that in relation to where we are coming from.  We have an extremely committed group of staff who engage with the Department on a weekly basis and with the schools on a daily basis, and the archdiocese, etc., to ensure that all children have places.<\/p> <p>  In relation to planning supports over the long term, I have heard from all speakers today about considering transitions, not only as students leave school but also throughout the lifespan of the student in school.  The Senator's question today is around students who need access to those placements at the start of their school lifespan.  We encounter some students who need supports due to different variations that can happen.  For instance, they may have debilitating conditions where they start off a school trajectory in a mainstream environment without needing any access to extra supports, but while they progress through the system their needs can vary greatly to the extent that there could be significant mental health needs that occur towards the end of their trajectory.  We welcome that idea of having that lifespan approach and mapping out skills for life across the trajectory of the needs of the young person.<\/p> <p>  While there is that requirement, we also recognise in the NCSE there is a demand for children to access specialist placements when they start in school.  Our experience would be that in the early years in primary school in a mainstream setting, within junior infants, senior infants, first class and second class, it is very much a play-based curriculum that we now have in place with the Aistear programme.  We recognise that for an early intervention process to be inclusive of all children with all needs, there are significant benefits for young children to access mainstream supports within schools and access additional supports.  The focus of the planning would be that the children with the greatest level of need would get access to the greatest levels of support.  Our view would be that every child obviously has access to an education and that there would be merit in parents recognising for young children starting schools that while there is significant anxiety among parents around children getting a diagnosis of a disability, recognising the considerable needs and wanting to have the greatest level of support, there is a significant level of support that can be gained from students accessing a mainstream setting where they can learn from their peers and access those supports around the holistic capacity-building approach that is in schools.<\/p> <p>  The Senator may have further questions or may want me to discuss that further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022021700002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Prendeville"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I appreciate the extent of Ms Prendeville's answer.  I disagree that the NCSE cannot ask because of data protection.  It is essential that the NCSE asks so that there can be proper planning for children.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that Our Lady of Hope School was opened by the two Ministers.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the ongoing incredible work by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  I also acknowledge her drive.  She works very closely with the NCSE.  I question this being a board of management decision.  I believe we need a greater sense of intervention.  I know of a case where a board of management filled in a report stating that it did not have capacity and when it was checked out, it actually had capacity for a special class.  The decision was overturned once the NCSE intervened and once we had the on-site inspection team.  The kindest word I can use to describe boards of management is \"conservative\".  Other terms I could use would be \"prejudice\" and \"downright bias\" towards discrimination on occasion.  We need to root that out firmly.

I regularly meet a constituent from Carlow who had a very bad accident resulting in a brain injury.  His biggest concern is that if anything happens to him, he must go to Dublin if he is worried about an issue.  There is no outreach support locally in Carlow.  He has a great GP and that is not the problem.  Rural areas, for example Carlow, do not have proper infrastructure.  We do not have buses to take people around the town like the cities have.  People with disabilities living in rural areas are at a major disadvantage.  My friend who has the brain injury regularly tells me that it is like an invisible disability.  If he needs anything at all, he needs to go to Dublin which is something we need to address.<\/p> <p>  There should be some automatic entitlement to medical cards.  It is unfair for people to have to fight for them.  We also need to address the position regarding bus passes.<\/p> <p>  The cost of living is very important.  The failure to provide additional supports places people with disabilities at a marked disadvantage.  Students with disabilities often need additional financial supports and it should not be allowed happen.  I have worked very closely with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and I am delighted that we will now have a technological university for the south east.  We should ensure that our technological universities provide support for people with a disability.  There needs to be some change there.  We have never had so much funding for third level education.  If we do not prioritise people with a disability now, it is unfair.  We cannot allow it to happen.<\/p> <p>  At second level, there is career guidance available.  There is something available at third level; I think it is called accessibility or something of that nature.  I am not sure of the name.  It is important that the Minister is also aware that we are meeting the needs of people with disabilities to encourage them to go to third level education.  That should be our goal from this meeting.  We should write to the Minister about this.<\/p> <p>  I know I am harping on about my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  We are very blessed to have Rehab and the Delta Centre in Carlow.<\/p> <p>  I have been told that some students with a disability who go out on work placement do not get a payment.  These people are breaking many barriers, meeting people they do not know and it is outside their routine.  It is something we need to look at.  I am not sure it happens in all cases, but one or two people have told me they did not get payments.  These are small things but can be quite important and we need to ensure they do not happen.<\/p> <p>  We need to look at a payment plan in respect of postgraduate fees.  Anybody who wants to go to third level, particularly if they have a disability, should be encouraged to go.  Based on today's meeting, it should be a priority for us to ensure that nobody who wants to go to third level or to do a degree would face any barriers related to resources or funding.  It is hard enough as it is.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I was going to ask have already been posed.  It is great that we highlighted the need and it is important for us to make people aware.  It is harder for people with disabilities who live outside Dublin and the other cities.  They are often forgotten and it is something that this committee needs to address.

How do we cross these barriers when schools are looking for them?  I know some schools might not have the room to extend.  We have been through a pandemic and for the past two years it has been very hard for families to get assessments for their children.

I have been heartened by the discussion and the questions that were asked.  The committee is trying to do a lot.  It is trying to look at primary, secondary, further and higher education.  I ask the committee to give itself the time to be able to give every area the attention it needs.  It should not be a competition between all the areas.  It is important that children now coming up through the education system get every support but we must also remember there are people aged 25 and above who did not get those supports first time around and want to get back into education.  We should not be in competition with each other for resources.<\/p> <p>  Somebody mentioned the considerable amount of money that, quite rightly, is going into third level.  We are saying we want to upskill and become a high-skill economy but that is not translating into including higher numbers of people with disabilities.  People with disabilities are a very broad group.  I can talk only about me and people with disabilities like my own.  If we have the right supports, we can access flexible, part-time and well-paid work but that can happen only with the supports and if the threat of losing our social welfare is taken away.  That must go.  Going back to education cannot be a high-risk endeavour.  I should not be worried that I might lose this or that when I go into education.  That is another area where this committee's responsibility crosses over with that of the Department of Social Protection.  There is only so much that can be done within education without also correcting the anomalies in social welfare.  It will not work otherwise.  I do not envy the committee because there is a lot of work involved.

I am joined by my colleague, Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n McGlone, from Belfast who is the programme manager for our PEACE IV-funded programme addressing the legacy of violence through facilitated dialogue.  This opening statement introduces Glencree&rsquo;s work, particularly with victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and across this island.<\/p><p> To give a bit of context for those who are not too familiar with Glencree, we were established in 1974 in response to the conflict in Northern Ireland.  The Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation works to prevent and transform political and intercommunal conflict and build peaceful and inclusive societies.  As the only dedicated peace centre in the Republic of Ireland, we bring individuals and groups impacted by conflict together and help them to find pathways to reconciliation and sustained peace through facilitated dialogue, relationship-building, public discourse and shared learning.<\/p><p> We transform conflict by focusing on six key programme areas.  Our community and political dialogue programme works with political parties and their representatives drawn from across the islands of Ireland and Britain, as well as civic society organisations and actors integral to the political debate. We do this by creating and sustaining a process where people of different traditions, political persuasions or cultural identities can come together in confidential spaces to discuss the issues that arise as disrupting factors in their relationships with each other.<\/p><p> Our PEACE IV-funded programme focuses on addressing the legacy of violence through facilitated dialogue by working with victims' and survivors' groups, representatives and individuals with differing interpretations of what happened in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s past.  We achieve this through different mechanisms of engagement and sustained contact between victims and survivors and those perceived to have inflicted harm upon them.<\/p><p> Our intercultural and refugee programme aims to make Ireland a more welcoming and inclusive place, with respect for all ethnic, faith and cultural backgrounds, by facilitating intercultural dialogues among refugees, migrants and members of ethnic and faith minority communities.<\/p><p> Our women's leadership programme is closely aligned with UN Resolution 1325 and aims to support and empower women on the island of Ireland who have experience of political conflict and its effects to expand their influence and become active leaders in the political processes that promote peacebuilding on the island of Ireland and internationally.<\/p><p> The peace education and young adult work that we undertake aims to promote engagement among students and young adults from across the island of Ireland through peace education, shared learning and cross-Border, cross-community relationship building.  One of the programmes included in that is our partnership with Politics in Action in Northern Ireland, which works with young schoolchildren in the North and South and engages with politicians North and South.  These programmes support young people in exploring their own and each others' identities and history, while at the same time allowing space for thought and action to build a shared future.  The development of this work is a key priority for Glencree under our new Strategic Plan 2022-2026, as we seek to establish a centre of excellence for practical peacebuilding in Glencree, which will be focussed on training and supporting the next generation of peacebuilders on this island.  This is a particular area that we are very focused on in Glencree.<\/p><p> The southern voice for peace programme promotes an all-island, civil society approach to lasting peace in Northern Ireland.  This programme features a number of public events each year which seek to engage people from the Republic of Ireland with the issues, organisations and communities in Northern Ireland in order to make a contribution to deepening reconciliation throughout the whole island.<\/p><p> Internationally, Glencree has supported peace efforts in more than ten countries including Haiti, Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan, Palestine-Israel and, most recently, Cameroon.  As well as sharing learnings from the Northern Irish peace process, this work also presents a very useful opportunity for Glencree to learn from the experiences of conflict transformation in other jurisdictions. <\/p><p> Today our focus will remain on our own shores and the work we are undertaking to address the legacy of conflict in Northern Ireland.  I will talk a little bit about Ms McGlone's programme in particular.  The PEACE IV-funded programme is on addressing the legacy of conflict through facilitated dialogue.  Well over two decades since the signing of the Good Friday-Belfast Agreement, Northern Ireland and the Border counties remain divided along communal lines.  A contributing factor to this divide is the inadequacy of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent political efforts to address the legacy of past violence.  The deficit is most acutely felt in the divisive relationship between victims' and survivors' groups and the individuals, groups and institutions perceived to have inflicted harm upon them in the past.  In 2017, Glencree was awarded four years of PEACE IV funding under the building positive relations strand to target these issues through our addressing the legacy of violence through facilitated dialogue programme.  The programme is due to finish at the end of August 2022 after being granted an eight-month extension due to the limitations on our work inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p> This programme primarily focuses on the experiences of victims and survivors groups and their communities in Northern Ireland.  Through a process-based approach that creates the space for private and confidential facilitated dialogues and the promotion of sustained contact across divides, themes and issues that remain as obstacles to deeper understanding and the promotion of positive relations are examined.  A crucial aspect of this programme has been that the groups, along with other relevant parties, co-develop their own process and pace of engagement prior to entering into dialogue with groups and individuals with differing interpretations of what happened in the past.  The primary objectives of this programme have been: increased empathy, understanding, and acknowledgment of other stories and lived experiences; transformed social and political attitudes; decreased sectarianism; increased profile of women and women&rsquo;s stories within the legacy context; and increased confidence within victims' and survivors' groups that are perceived as being hard to reach.<\/p><p> The learning we have accrued through this project has been and will continue to be shared on national and international platforms via journal publications, webinars, reports, roundtables and symposia, with victims' and survivors' groups, other interest groups, academics, policy-makers and practitioners, to assist in ascertaining how to productively engage with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s contentious past.<\/p><p> On reflecting on the lifetime of the project to date, while progress has been made in some areas, what is evident is that the political processes in place to address the issues faced by victims and survivors remain inadequate in both jurisdictions.  The social and political context in which the <\/p><p>programme has operated has been extremely challenging.  As the committee will appreciate, legacy issues are very contested and the work has had to navigate major upheaval during the programme life cycle, including a sustained collapse of the Stormont Assembly, Brexit, ongoing disagreements <\/p><p>over the Northern Ireland Protocol, failure to implement the Stormont House Agreement, recent legacy proposals from the UK Government and, indeed, the Covid-19 pandemic.  In this context, it has been vital that our programme has the flexibility to be responsive to social and political change. Victims' and survivors' groups and other programme participants can re-evaluate their strategic priorities, alter or reprioritise specific goals and seek to delay or accelerate particular facets of dialogue processes in response to changing contexts.  This can present significant challenges for the type of <\/p><p>work the legacy of violence programme is undertaking.<\/p><p> Despite the PEACE IV funding drawing to a close in August, Glencree remains committed to work with victims and survivors in Northern Ireland.  It is a commitment that has been embedded in Glencree&rsquo;s new five-year Strategic Plan 2022-2026, which will be formally launched in the coming weeks at Dublin Castle.<\/p><p> We welcome questions from the committee and thank members again for the opportunity to discuss our work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Naoimh McNamee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":814,"content":"<p>The order of speakers' contributions for different political parties and groupings is Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, SDLP, MPs and Alliance MPs, Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in MPs, Labour Party and then Independents and Aont&uacute;.

We do not represent victims and survivors, but we work alongside them.  We are not here to represent anyone.  We keep confidential the groups that we work with.  However, I can absolutely guarantee that we work with every sort of group set up to work with victims and survivors in Northern Ireland.  This includes those connected to people who were killed by the State and people who were members of State forces.  We work with all victims but we have not met anyone who agrees with the proposal.  That does not mean they all have the same reason for not agreeing with it, but none of the groups we work with agree with it.  We are talking about groups representing thousands of people.  We work with the main representatives of those groups and wider groups.  I was going to print out the numbers because one of the things Europe is very good at is looking for figures.  I was going to print them out but I did not.  I can supply them to the Deputy.  We have had in the region of almost a thousand contacts with people over the four years.  We have had multiple contacts with people.  We work with four large hard-to-reach groups as well as doing bigger events.

When you have objectives around increasing empathy, understanding and shifting mindsets, which cut across the work Glencree does, it can be quite difficult to measure success.  You cannot do a simple quantitative analysis.  The programme is formally evaluated throughout its life cycle.  One thing that is very important to the work of Glencree is the principle of co-design.  While we have a planned series of engagements through the Glencree models we use in the context of facilitating dialogue and building relationships using, as Ms McGlone has mentioned, different mechanisms, such as the arts and providing opportunities for people to get together, when it comes to how people are coming along with the single-identity work and being willing to meet with those from other communities or those who have different views, there are bespoke models for measuring how things are shifting along, but it is not straightforward.  We are quite lucky to work with the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, a funder that understands the sensitive nature of the work.  As to the crux of what Glencree does, as Ms McGlone has said, we do not represent victims and survivors, but walk along with them.  We have our planned level of activity and also remain flexible with regard to what is going on in social and political contexts and what the victims themselves want to see happen.  When talking about victims and survivors and what they have been through, the power has been taken away from them.  When it comes to the process of reconciliation or people being able to work through the issues they have, giving them some power in that area is very important.  That is an important part of what Glencree does in supporting them through that process.  I hope that helps to provide a little more context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Naoimh McNamee"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

What we do is to encourage them to have the people around the table who can help and work with them.  There has been enormous success in terms of walking with people on a journey.  Sometimes, people view victims as people who are out there and different from the rest of us but they are exactly the same as us.  They have fears, concerns and anxieties just as we do.  The beauty of a project like ours is that there is no rush.  We can take things at people's own pace.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the public-facing aspect of our project, if you go back seven years to when funding for Glencree was first thought about and when the SEUPB entered into negotiations, it was probably felt at that stage that we would be an awful lot further on by now.  In those seven years, there has been the assembly at Stormont.  All our groups are from the North, although one of the groups we work with works with some victims in the South.  However, we thought we would be an awful lot further on.  That is what we were alluding to in the end part of the statement, which was about the political, social and cultural background to this work.  It has been very difficult and painstaking but we now have the people around the table who need to be around the table.  Ms McNamee would know more about the all-Ireland situation than I would.  Perhaps she would like to follow on in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n McGlone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I will add to that, if I may.  Making sure the right people are around the table and that all voices are represented is really important to the work of Glencree.  With Ms McGlone's programme and across the work of Glencree, we find people who are at different places in their journey.  There is no standard approach for everyone.  We meet people where they are.  There may be individuals or groups who require a bit more one-to-one work.  We have to work harder at developing trust with some.  We do whatever it takes to keep those conversations going and build that trust to make sure that people feel comfortable and safe engaging with the dialogue.  That is of paramount importance to us.  I do not mean to oversimplify it but the work across Glencree boils down to two things: building improbable relationships across divides and facilitating difficult dialogue.  In order to do that, we have to create a very safe space.  With regard to the trust we have with the participants and those we work with, our reputation is one of our greatest assets in Glencree.  We now have almost 50 years of experience and that is something that stands to us.  Because of the quiet and confidential nature of the work and people's faith that it will not be breached, we can go into places and engage with people who are very hard to reach or who are reluctant to come to the table.  As I have said, we do not make exceptions.  We ensure that everyone who needs to be at the table is at it.  We do whatever we need to do to work towards that in the context of our work.<\/p> <p>  On Mr. Brady's question regarding an all-island assembly, from Glencree's perspective, we are absolutely in favour of conversation and engaging with one another.  Citizens' assemblies have had great success in hearing people's voices.  When they are run well and respectfully and when voices are heard with regard to what needs to be said, they can work extremely well.  In principle, Glencree is absolutely in favour of open, honest, public and transparent dialogue, but we would have a particular interest in how that dialogue is facilitated and mediated.  With regard our principles around creating a safe space, trust and respectful dialogue, it must be ensured that it does not descend into a positional politics back and forth and that there is an open and honest exchange.  As I have said, however, there is great benefit to it so we in Glencree are in favour of talking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Naoimh McNamee"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":827,"content":"<p>Does Ms McGlone wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#D00100","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":828,"content":"<p>I refer back to the debacle that was the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland.

I will not make any comment on the civic forum, but it was a very large experiment in bringing civic society together and people have their views one way or the other.  I agree with Ms McNamee.  My expertise lies in how one creates the safe space and how one facilitates that dialogue without alienating people but making people feel comfortable.

I was between meetings so I heard some of it, but not all.  However, I read it beforehand.  I tried to get in from my office and I did not manage that so I came back down again.<\/p> <p>  I am very much aware of the work the centre has done over the years before and after the Good Friday Agreement.  I spent a weekend in Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation quite a number of years ago in the 2000s and I am aware of the vital work it does.  For the purposes of the committee and the witnesses' presence here, would it be possible for them to give a view as to their input into the lead-up to the Good Friday Agreement?  How vital was the work the organisation did in shaping the ground, let us say, in the lead-up to the Good Friday Agreement and after the agreement?<\/p> <p>  Following on from that, there is a narrative that with any future border poll some will call for it sooner and others will call for it later.  I understand the witnesses cannot take a side, and I am not asking them to do so, but there is a narrative that a citizens' assembly would have to be held in the lead-up to that to deal with issues.  Do they have an opinion in that regard?  From my perspective, the difficulties and the divergences of opinion are so great that it will take something much greater than a citizens' assembly to get everybody to the one space.  We have a great deal of work to do.  In my view, a citizens' assembly could not take on the disparity and the amount of work involved, considering the amount of work that was done behind the scenes before the Good Friday Agreement to get the agreement across the lines.  There was a massive amount of work, in addition to the back-channelling.  Could our guests give us a flavour of some of that?  Not to do down a citizens' assembly, but could they give us a taste of what is involved?  How many more organisations like the centre are out there behind the scenes doing this back-channel work, if I can call it that?  What is their general view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#D00600","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":833,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions, which are quite interesting.  I am a little biased in saying that Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation's role was very integral or important.  The centre is the only peace centre in the Republic of Ireland.  There is the Corrymeela Community in the North as well.  The difference with Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation is that we have no religious affiliations.  It is a secular organisation.  The centre has been going for 50 years and our work has evolved throughout that time to support the peace process on this island and to engage for the people in the North and the people across the island who are doing this.  There is a very strong public service ethic in the centre.  We are resourced for the State and for communities in the North.  We work with politicians in London and with individuals in the UK as well.<\/p> <p>  I will come to the issue of a citizens' assembly or a public forum, but it is essential that there are places or environments where people can come away from the public eye, the media and the pressure of party lines and engage with each other as human beings, addressing the issues that come up for people.  We need to be creative about this.  We are in a very precarious time after Brexit.  Much great work has been done by people in Northern Ireland and people on this side of the Border on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, but we are still not there yet.  We have made mistakes.  There is much that still needs to happen.  Brexit, as the committee can appreciate, has put much pressure on relationships that were hard won and which we worked hard to help create.  That is something that has kept us very busy in Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation over the last almost six years.<\/p> <p>  For that private, confidential work, those safe spaces where things are very contentious, to be able to work through those issues in a safe space, to be able to disagree in private, come back together and work on that relationship, but have that commitment to work together regardless of the divides, organisations such as ours can offer a support to help people do that.  That is something.  We still engage regularly with the actors from the peace process who helped negotiate the Good Friday Agreement.  One comment in particular that stood out for me came from a senior unionist politician.  He said his biggest regret was that the importance of establishing and maintaining those relationships across divides was lost in the years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the strong focus for us in Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding a citizens' assembly, as Ms McGlone said, and we feel strongly about this, we support the idea in principle, but it depends on how it is done.  It depends on the mediation and facilitation facility that is set up around it, the nature of the space and how it is done whereby people are encouraged to engage in a professional, courteous and meaningful way, and with a sense of creativity.  The issue of the constitutional question and discussions about it is not something we can avoid, nor should we.  We all need to take seriously our responsibility for contributing to the ideas on how we want to live together in the future.  We have experienced a great deal of change on these two islands over thousands of years.  We must not sleepwalk into the future on this, but engage well with each other on how that happens.<\/p><p>I have some concerns about how that is done.<\/p><p> On the idea of a Border poll, what scares me significantly is the idea that 51% or 52% might be in favour but what about the rest, in terms of a principle of consent?  There are clear legal provisions in the Good Friday Agreement.  All sides signed up to that.  However, we have seen the contentious nature of the Brexit vote.  We have seen what that has done to communities and to relationships in the UK and with us.  For me, an awful lot more work needs to be done.  It is painstaking at times.  It requires a lot of patience.  It can be frustrating.  That informal diplomacy, back-channel discussion, and getting people ready to come to the table to engage in that debate is crucial.  That is what Glencree does.  That is where we come in and, as always, we stand ready to help in whatever way we can.  We also work closely with individuals and smaller organisations that are working towards the same goals of peace and reconciliation.<\/p><p> As Glencree is the only peace centre in the Republic of Ireland and with the unique experience we have, we believe we have a strong responsibility to contribute in any way we can.  The Senator is right in terms of the role Glencree played in getting younger politician, civil servants, community actors, combatants, former combatants, victims, and survivors together leading up to the Good Friday Agreement and how that important that was.  When a relationship or conversation broke down, Glencree was able to go places where other State actors may not have.  We take that responsibility and role very seriously.  That has continued throughout the implementation phase, through the different negotiations, and through Brexit.  From the time the vote was announced to this very day, our teams have expanded working in that area.  We are working very closely with London in a time when relationships, east and west, are probably at their most fragile in well over 50 years.  We have put a lot of stock in the work we do.  It has to be quiet.  It has to be done under the radar.  Not many people know about it at times, but it is essential and something that we are committed to continuing as we navigate through these difficult and turbulent times we are facing politically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Naoimh McNamee","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I cannot speak to Glencree's role before or after the Good Friday Agreement because I was not there.  I was in Belfast starting on interfaces.  What I will say is that there were various developments which came out of that.  Take the example of Brexit, which Ms McNamee finished on, and how it was managed or not managed, depending on one's perspective.  What was different about coming up to the Good Friday agreement was many things.  It was a multilayered and very complex set of issues.  Our civic society was very engaged.  It was a very dangerous time for us but it was a very exciting time.  That was because civic society were engaged in the discussions.  They were engaged in everything from the referendum to the setting up of the Parades Commission and the Human Rights Commission.  Any attempt to look at a change, be that constitutional change or whatever, has to engage on a number of different levels.  When I remember those times, it was as though we were all involved.  Everybody was involved in one aspect or another.  Some of us were involved on the ground, keeping the peace, so that the politicians could get on with it.  Some people were involved in Human Rights Commission.  It was about making sure it was done the right way.  It was about advising Government.<\/p> <p>  There were a lot of really good and vibrant organisations.  This example always sticks in my mind.  I remember during the lead up to the referendum, one of the organisations got see-through stickers and put them on the green part of every traffic light in Belfast so that when it turned green, it said \"Yes\".  Using innovative ways of bringing people on board is critically important.  I am passionate about this aspect of it because I have lived through it and know the consequences of it.  There have to be the spaces and politicians.<\/p> <p>  There also needs to be partnerships.  Let us remember, we had people from South Africa helping us.  I went to the John F. Kennedy School of Government with political parties.  Stanford University was involved.  Academic people were helping as well.  A whole range of people need to be brought together.  For me, Glencree is the perfect beautiful setting to do some of that background work with the people who need to help us through.  The Senator is right: it cannot be done with one group or one assembly.  There are many interwoven issues.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the question on a truth and reconciliation commission, which I did not answer.  We did not have that commission but there was lots of storytelling and things were happening in the Northern Ireland.

There is a whole complexity of reasons why sectarianism has reared its head.  We can be very disparaging of ourselves.  We are really nice to outsiders; we just do not like each other from growing up in the North and in Belfast.  There is a certain amount of truth in that.  I know this is going to sound very counter intuitive but the reason any sectarianism is not necessarily a bad thing.  I know that is counter-intuitive.<\/p><p>People were saying it behind closed doors and now maybe they were saying it out in the open.  I would much prefer to facilitate a session where people are putting those things, and how they think, out on the table.  Until that is gotten rid of and until it has gotten out, there is a lot of resistance and a lot of difficulty.  If we take that as a microcosm of a society, then maybe we needed to have the conversations.  We went through a number of cycles, the first of which not to talk about the war.  There were so many different manifestations of that.  It was everything from people not saying what they did, who they were with, or going into other areas.  It was a case of, \"Let us not talk about the war\".  Then we had a period where there was very much an upheaval in people talking about stuff, and then we have come around again.  It comes back to the fact that we do not have a shared understanding of what caused the conflict.  We do not have a shared understanding of what caused the war, so people are vying for position with regard to who caused it.<\/p><p> The members' response to my next point might be, \"Oh well, you would say that anyway\".  The rise in social media has had an enormous impact.  Where people had been talking behind closed doors and perhaps in community groups, now they are saying it with access to tens of thousands or millions of people.  I do not have the answer to what the Senator has said but I would caution by saying that it is not necessarily a bad thing.  People are braver now to say things that they really feel, whereas previously it might have eaten them up inside.  A society that is eating itself up inside is not a good society.  It manifests in lots of different ways.  Psychologists say that the body holds the score.  I believe this also in a bigger arena whereby society holds the score.  We have been through a lot of pain and a lot of trauma.  As a society we live with that pain and trauma.   Some of the ways of getting through that is to talk about it.  It does not answer the Senator's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n McGlone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":844,"content":"<p>That is excellent and it really does.

As Ms McNamee has said, yes there were difficulties with the Good Friday Agreement and particularly around the issues of victims and survivors who should have been central to the agreement and they were not.  It is just as simple as that, in my humble opinion.  They should have been central but they were not but look at what else we did.

In his previous question the Senator asked about Northern Ireland society being divided and a Border division again.  Obviously, Ms McGlone comes from that area.  Brexit has forced the issue of identity to the fore again.  Identity is a very complex issue and a very strong part of the conflict in the North.  It was very eloquently dealt with in the Good Friday Agreement in that people could be British or Irish or both.  With Brexit it has forced this back into a black and white realm where people must choose.  All of the conversations about the protocol or about Article 16 have had a big impact on how relations have broken down and people have gone back into their camps, and in our experience this has been around the issue of identity and being forced to choose.  I just wanted to make that point.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's question about a shared understanding, I would agree absolutely with Ms McGlone that it is probably not going to happen, and it is not necessarily likely.  I would also say, however, that it does not need to happen if there is a shared commitment and understanding of where we want to get to, as in a peaceful future and living well together and - going back to the Senator's previous comment - not front loading the destination of what that is going to look like, and having that commitment to actually engage with one another.  There is no issue with people having their different narratives once they are prepared to listen and engage with one another.<\/p> <p>  With all of the work and momentum, and the sense of pushing a boulder up the hill with the peace process and its implementation, Brexit has been one of the most disturbing factors in that whole process since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Again, it is the issue of identity and people going back into their camps.  We have experienced this as people being less likely to engage and they may have stepped back a little bit.  Much more work is needed to be done on a more one-to-one basis.  A lot more patience is required in certain areas.  It is two steps forward and one step back, at times.  It is about tenacity, determination and patience for moving forward with that.  Glencree supporting people with that is of paramount importance to us.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the issue of social media and those relationships, the different things that happen from a political perspective such as announcements from the EU or commentary from British or Irish politicians, and the impact it has on people's willingness to come to the table.  Things may be taken out of context or may have been said in the heat of the moment.  The impact this has behind the scenes on people's willingness to talk or engage cannot be overestimated.  This is something we deal with on a regular basis.  Because of the nature of the centre with regard to confidentiality and subtlety, we are able to go in and repair those relationships where possible.  It is a long process and there have been many setbacks over the years since the Brexit vote.  It is difficult but it is about the strong commitment to keep moving forward and a commitment to the peace process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Naoimh McNamee"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I find it very interesting that both Ms McGlone and Ms McNamee have mentioned the impact of social media.

The second point is that yes, very often I would be in groups where one of the things we try to record is the context of meetings over the period of years.  Very often it is local context that comes up in the groups, not national or international.

Engaging with people in that way is very important and that is not always easy for people to do.  There is an ongoing training plan in Glencree for staff where we may have identified particular areas, but the people who come to work with Glencree are experts in their field and are chosen for the variety of skills they have in a given area.

Ms McNamee mentioned the issue of the 50% plus-one threshold and asked what will happen to the minority if the result is as narrow as that, but that is democracy.

I agree work would need to be done on that, with information on any campaign or any view of how the future might look.  For us, it is about the importance of bringing people along as much as possible and the volume of work that would be involved in that.

We are clearly very much in support of it but it is a matter of implementation.  Today we are focusing on the lack of provision for victims and survivors.  It is not perfect; no peace process is.  There are gaps and things that have not been implemented.  That is what we are talking about.  That is not to take away at all from the overall achievement of the Good Friday Agreement.  There are always rays of hope within communities, large and small, in the North.  That is particularly true of the young people in how they are coming together and working so hard.

That is what we want to support in Glencree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Naoimh McNamee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":862,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McNamee.  Anyone listening to her or Ms McGlone would be very clear that they are very complimentary of the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement.  Ms McNamee said it was a fabulous and massive achievement.  All of us around this table would agree with that and we compliment those who made it possible.  It is up to all of us to ensure it is implemented in full.  I have often said we have not maximised the potential of the agreement.  There is so much more to be done by all of us on this island and by the Irish and British Governments.  That will be the case for some time into the future as well.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the importance of conversations, and Senator Blaney reflected those thoughts as well.  We are short quite a number of members today as some of our colleagues are attending an all-island, cross-Border event in Enniskillen.  It is a shared island event and that is especially focused on women's issues, as far as I know.  One of my colleagues, Senator McGreehan, said she could not make it here today because she was attending that important event in Enniskillen.  I mentioned the shared island.  The shared island initiative is facilitating conversations at sectoral level, be those related to tourism or different aspects of our everyday living.  It is important we have those conversations at different levels, whether in the community and voluntary sector, tourism and hospitality, agriculture or different sports.  There are many important issues we can address on an all-Ireland basis.  Those conversations at sectoral level are very important and they will get to the nub of problems much more quickly and with a greater significance than a citizens' assembly that deals with every subject matter.  Conversations at micro level as well as the macro level are important.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the PEACE education programme.  Some of their programmes have been funded by PEACE IV.  In response to questions I put in the D&aacute;il recently, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform stated it is hoped the new PEACE PLUS programme will be formally signed off on by Europe in the not-too-distant future.  It is the desire of the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to have that programme in place as soon as possible.  I hope the Glencree project can benefit from the PEACE PLUS programme, and I am sure I speak for the committee when I say we will support Glencree in its request to the PEACE PLUS programme.  We value the work the witnesses do and they have been before this committee on a number of occasions.<\/p> <p>  If we do not succeed with education and ensuring people achieve better attainment in education, some of the issues that have bedevilled society will continue.  The Integrated Education Fund was before the committee recently.  There are particular difficulties in a lack of attainment at second level, in further education and at third level as well.  We need improvement through the different strata in education.<\/p> <p>  One programme I always thought very beneficial and useful was the Wider Horizons programme.  I do not know if the witnesses are familiar with it.  Our colleague here in the Oireachtas, Senator Wilson, was Youthreach co-ordinator in County Cavan at the time and he had a number of youth training programmes going between groups in this State and groups in Northern Ireland.  Deputy Tully would know this from her vocational education committee in County Cavan.  The Youthreach centres collaborated with similar groups in Northern Ireland.  Youth groups from Northern Ireland came to their counterparts south of the Border and engaged in some of the work, training and learning they were doing.  Similarly, the groups from here travelled north.  Part of that programme involved travel abroad to the United States, Australia or wherever there were Irish communities.  Ms McGlone mentioned some of the schools and universities with a particular focus on politics as it applies to our island.  They were involved in vocational programmes there.  I followed up because I attended many of the events over the years in my constituency.  To my knowledge, many of the contacts made by those young people at that time have continued 20 years on.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  The people who took part in those programmes were predominantly those in second chance education.  Youthreach is often populated by young people who left formal education but now want to go back and follow a particular course.  In many instances today it is great to see those people going back to second chance education.  They then go off to the further education sector and many of them end up with primary degrees and higher qualifications as well.  The Wider Horizons programme does not exist nowadays.  It has been gone for a number of years but that type of programme could be beneficial in targeting a particular age group.  We should build on the success of those programmes.<\/p> <p>  In her opening remarks, Ms McNamee mentioned people who are hard to reach.  That is a very good phrase because it is often the people who do not engage with different groups who are left out and isolated.  Maybe they think there is nobody to listen to them, help them or understand them.  We all know that from our own communities.  Thankfully, in Ireland today we have great senior citizens' groups and very active communities where social activities were arranged pre-Covid.  Now they are, we hope, resuming for the future as well.  These groups meet socially once a week or whatever.  Oftentimes there is a still a cohort that will not attend those groups.  Some of these people are isolated and live very lonely lives.  It is about how to reach them.<\/p> <p>  In every walk of life and each sector of society there will be that small cohort that will not be reached.  I do not know how to devise a mechanism to get to those people who are hard to reach.  There needs to be a particular focus in all our work on reaching those people.  I commend the witnesses on highlighting that within the victims' and survivors' groups.  I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his Department was satisfied that there was engagement with the families of victims at official level.  In some instances people have not sought help or maybe they have not been reached out to.  It would be shocking and very disappointing if there are people who have not been given support or maybe have not sought support and who do not benefit from whatever support schemes are in place.  They do not want to think of the work of WAVE Trauma Centre or other advocacy and support groups.<\/p> <p>  I have attended different Glencree events over the years, as have other colleagues on this committee, and I found them very beneficial because of the Chatham House rules.  People could speak their mind at these events and 99% of the time - if not more - they would not be quoted.  It is a very good concept.  I was at one of the first engagements the centre held about Brexit and it was very informative.  It was a time when people from different traditions were very concerned about what might emerge.  The Glencree Centre's work in that regard, about which all of our colleagues have spoken today, is very important because there are so many issues still to be dealt with.<\/p><p>We all know the legacy issues.  We need never remove the emphasis from supporting those people and trying to resolve those issues.  As we all know, that is not simple.<\/p><p> At the beginning I read out the names of quite a number of our colleagues who could not be here but who would like to be with us today.  I thank the witnesses for their excellent contributions.  I have no doubt that we will have further engagement with them as a committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022021700002#H00200","speaker":"1556","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645056000,"counter":864,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 2.50 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. on Thursday, 24 February 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government","time":1645056000,"counter":865},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 13:30<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 13:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Francis Noel Duffy, Victor Boyhan, Joe Flaherty, Mary Fitzpatrick, Emer Higgins, Mary Seery Kearney.

Members have been circulated with the opening statements and a briefing.  I will read a short note on privilege before we begin.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in the public meetings.  For those attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  <\/p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I invite our witnesses to make their opening statements.

My name is Virginia Teehan, I am chief executive officer of the Heritage Council.  It is a pleasure for me to meet with the committee again and I thank the committee for its continuing interest in heritage.  I am accompanied today by my colleague, Mr. Ian Doyle, head of conservation.  The Heritage Council&rsquo;s remit is very broad.  Today&rsquo;s topic, that of the monuments and archaeological heritage Bill, is of particular interest to us, as we have over many years engaged in the drafting of this through expert advisory groups.<\/p><p>The Heritage Council, which was established in 1995, inherited powers under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004, specifically the role and responsibilities of the National Monuments Advisory Council.  The Heritage Council has specific responsibilities under section 6 of the Heritage Act, which states: <\/p><blockquote>\tThe functions of the Council shall be to propose policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the national heritage, including monuments, archaeological objects, heritage objects, architectural heritage, flora, fauna, wildlife habitats, landscapes, seascapes, wrecks, geology, heritage gardens, parks and inland waterways. <\/blockquote><p>Since its foundation, the Heritage Council has undertaken extensive research, policy development, delivery and evaluation to support the planning, and management of Ireland&rsquo;s unique archaeological heritage.  Our commitment to supporting archaeological heritage is evident by our initiation and management of the initiatives I will now outline.<br\/><br\/>The Irish walled towns network, IWTN, was formed by the Heritage Council in 2005 to unite and co-ordinate the strategic efforts of local authorities and other stakeholders involved in the management, conservation and enhancement of historic walled towns in Ireland, both North and South.  The Heritage Council offers annual grants to the 29 towns that participate in the IWTN for the conservation and care of medieval town defences.<br\/><br\/>On the basis of policy advice provided to the Government on research needs in Irish archaeology, the council set up the Irish national strategic archaeological research, INSTAR, programme in 2008.  This funded a number of key collaborative projects in areas such as neolithic agriculture, ancient human remains and early medieval settlement.  This scheme has recently been relaunched by the National Monuments Service in collaboration with the Heritage Council and the Irish Research Council, and is now known as INSTAR+.<br\/><br\/>The Heritage Council is the primary funder of the discovery programme, the centre for archaeology and heritage research which was established by the Government in 1991.  It is a company limited by guarantee and covers areas of activity which concern climate change and coastal archaeology and the completion of the field survey at the Hill of Tara, County Meath.<br\/><br\/>The Heritage Council&rsquo;s adopt a monument scheme aims to empower local communities to take an active role in understanding, engaging with and protecting their local heritage.  Community groups that apply to take part in the scheme select an archaeological or historic monument in their locality.  If they are successful in their application to join the scheme, they literally adopt the monument.  The scheme now has a membership of 20 communities across the country who are engaged in caring for and learning about their local monuments.  After a public call, five new groups in Kerry, Cork, Donegal, Monaghan and Kildare will join this initiative in 2022.<br\/><br\/>The Heritage Council funds community archaeologists in partnership with the local authorities and farming bodies in Galway, Sligo, south Dublin, Dublin city, Roscommon and the Burren.  In the Burren and the Rathcroghan area of Roscommon, these are part of European innovation partnerships intended to demonstrate how farming can be beneficial for biodiversity, landscape and monuments.  We will expand this scheme in 2022 to counties Clare, Donegal and Wicklow.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the Heritage Council has produced several policy documents and guidance notes to support local authorities and communities in caring for archaeology, for example, notes on historic graveyards, rock art and ogham stones.  Working with a range of partners, including the National Monuments Service, the Office of Public Works, private landowners and local authorities, we have also supported the completion of conservation and management plans for important complexes like the Hill of Uisneach, County Westmeath, the Woodstown Viking age site in Waterford, and the Hill of Tara, County Meath, as well as a research framework for the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne world heritage site, County Meath.<br\/><br\/>Today, we are here to talk about the revised general scheme of the monuments and archaeological heritage Bill, which, at 84 heads, is a major piece of proposed heritage legislation.  Given that the provisions of the 1930 Act are still in force almost 100 years later, the proposed Bill is important for Ireland&rsquo;s heritage because it will guide and regulate practice and protection for several generations to come.  It is also likely to be of interest internationally.  We note the significant time and effort that has been invested during this lengthy process.  The Heritage Council welcomes the opportunity to comment on the revised general scheme of the monuments and archaeological heritage Bill.  The council has engaged in this process since 2008 via the expert advisory committee and, prior to this, in an earlier review during the period 1999 to 2001.<br\/><br\/>The legislative framework protecting archaeological resources in Ireland is governed principally by the National Monuments Acts, together with relevant provisions of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  Under the existing legislation, a number of mechanisms have been applied in order to secure the protection of archaeological monuments, including the register of historic monuments and the placing of preservation orders and temporary preservation orders on endangered monuments.  The disparate statutory sources for the above mechanisms are indicative of the piecemeal nature of the legislative framework&rsquo;s development, with the consolidation of this framework being one of the principal aims of the Bill, which we welcome.<br\/><br\/>We support the purpose of the proposed Bill, which seeks: first, to streamline the current multiple systems of monument protection into a single register with two levels of protection for monuments; second, to harmonise the system for protection of underwater cultural heritage with that for archaeological heritage on land; third, to introduce a statutory reporting scheme with associated automatic legal protection for new discoveries of archaeological sites; fourth, to revoke the various forms of licences and consents that exist under the Acts, which would be replaced with an integrated licensing system for works and other activities regulated under it; and, fifth, to introduce and provide for clear civil enforcement powers in regard to contraventions of the proposed Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Virginia Teehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Ms Teehan, but we try to keep the opening statements to about five minutes.

I am joined by my colleague, Ken Moore, who is the principal officer for the national monuments division.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to appear and to provide some input to this process.  I hope the views I will offer on behalf of the commissioners will help inform the committee's consideration of the issues involved from our point of view.  I know the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department representatives will have given the committee a comprehensive and broad-ranging analysis of the Bill from their particular perspective, so I will confine my remarks to the OPW remit and the issues that concern us most directly.  Though we have a critical role in these matters, and have some considerable longevity as an organisation working in the heritage conservation area, we do not have the broad heritage responsibilities that the Department has.  I will, therefore, aim not to stray into areas that I know the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and his officials may have already addressed with the committee.<\/p> <p>  The involvement of the commissioners in the protection of national monuments goes back a considerable period.  The first group of monuments taken into State care were the structures at the Rock of Cashel in 1874.  Subsequently, a significant number of sites were added to the list and, today, the OPW is responsible for the care of almost 1,000 monuments at 768 locations.  This includes sites that are directly owned by the State, as well as properties that are in guardianship, that is to say, they are privately held but have been entrusted to State care in perpetuity.  They range from megalithic tombs of the neolithic period to medieval churches and castles, industrial mills and historic buildings of more recent times.<\/p><p>This estate does not represent the entirety of national monuments in Ireland.  Many structures and sites around the country that are designated as national monuments are in private ownership and where the commissioners have no involvement.  This is an important distinction and can cause confusion where there is a misperception that the commissioners are responsible for monuments generally throughout the country when, in fact, our remit is strictly defined.<\/p><p> From the earliest point, it has been clear that one of the core functions of the commissioners is to ensure the preservation of the monuments in its care, and this was a singular focus in the 1930 legislation.  Though there was mention of opening monuments to the public in the 1930 Act, we should note it was not a central theme at that time, and I will return to this aspect of public engagement with national monuments more directly later in my remarks.<\/p><p> In the modern era, since the departmental forerunner to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was created in the mid-1990s, the commissioners have undertaken an explicitly executive role, caring for national monuments in State care and working in tandem with the Minister and our colleagues in the Department.  The commissioners, therefore, have a client relationship with the Department to look after the interests of the national monuments estate of which they are guardians or own.<\/p><p> The commissioners are explicitly tasked to look after the day-to-day job of physically protecting and conserving the monuments in their care and opening a number of them to the public as visitor attractions.  While we are, therefore, the body responsible for national monuments in State care, on the spot, it is also true to say that responsibility for national monuments in OPW care is split between the Commissioner of Public Works and the Department which has statutory responsibility for the ministerial consent process, for example, and performs the core legislative role in relation to archaeology.  The Department, therefore, has primary responsibility at Government level for the broad protection of heritage and is the senior body nationally that oversees the sector.  In this role, it is the main sponsor of the current Bill and we in the OPW are a key State stakeholder and actor.<\/p><p> I will now address some of the principal provisions of the Bill and how they relate to the OPW.  The Bill provides that funds relating to the enacted Bill are to be provided to the Department by the Oireachtas and a similar provision is made as regards the commissioners.  In addition, provision is made to allow the Minister grant funds to the commissioners.  Currently, the commissioners are funded through Vote 13 for the conservation, maintenance, operation and presentation of heritage sites in their care.  This means we are granted resources for staff wages, materials and maintenance costs related to the upkeep of sites in our care.  We are also allocated funds for the wages of staff and other operational costs related to those sites that have a significant visitor operation.<\/p><p> We are not, however, directly funded for the larger elective conservation projects we undertake specifically in the national monuments estate and we have to plan carefully for these.  We are also not funded for new visitor infrastructure such as visitor buildings, car parks and toilets.  Funding for these needs had been, in the last formal rearrangement of the respective responsibilities between the Department and OPW in 2003 to 2004, intended to be channelled through the Department, and the measure in the Bill gives that understanding legislative effect.  I would add we have an excellent working relationship with our colleagues in the Department and we work closely on the matters of capital funding for the national monument estate.<\/p><p> In recent years, the commissioners&rsquo; funding for national monuments has been supplemented by additional moneys from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Welcome though these have been, it is clearly the case these resources from F&aacute;ilte Ireland can only be for visitor projects and cannot be applied to core conservation works.<\/p><p> While referring to funding, I should also mention the rural regeneration and development funding channel that has emerged in recent years.  The OPW, like other public bodies, is eligible to apply and has been successful in some applications to date.  Again, this has made funding available for visitor facilities rather than conservation works.  Other external funding opportunities are also available through various EU programmes that are designed to support initiatives in cultural heritage.  We will remain alive to the possibilities these present.<\/p><p> The part of the Bill dealing with monuments is a major part of the legislation and covers a range of core matters, including a system for the protection of newly discovered archaeological sites, a single register of monuments and management by local authorities or the commissioners of registered monuments in the ownership or guardianship of a local authority or the Minister, as the case may be.  The commissioners welcome the creation of a single register of monuments and we believe it would clarify a considerable amount of confusion as to the status of a broad range of sites throughout the country.  We are clear about the status of sites in our own care but acknowledge the value of this measure to address the lack of clarity surrounding a multiplicity of sites not in State care throughout the country.<\/p><p> The preservation role for sites in State care, by either the commissioners or local authorities, has always been understood, of course, particularly historically at the time of the original 1930 Act.  However, over time, this has been obscured somewhat by the different arrangements that have arisen since.  The new Bill, as proposed, gives the commissioners&rsquo; management regime a stronger legislative basis that is more reflective of the existing operating framework and better recognises the position of the commissioners under the arrangements.  I will not continue with that point.  The committee has the remainder of my note on it.<\/p><p> Part of the proposed Bill relates to the treatment of world heritage sites in domestic law.  The 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage was ratified by Ireland in 1992 without the enactment of any domestic implementing legislation.  This Bill will give the term \"world heritage site\" a legal basis in law, for the first time, thus strengthening the legal standing of the use of the term in county development plans, as adopted by planning authorities.  The adoption of development plan objectives is one of the principal means by which management plans for the current world heritage sites in the State are implemented, and the commissioners rely on them significantly at the two world heritage sites for which we are responsible, Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l.<\/p><p> In discussing world heritage sites, I should perhaps point out that the commissioners have no formal statutory role in the designation of sites.  The Bill provides for appropriate public consultation processes to be put in place before nominating further world heritage sites.  This is designed to ensure future designations are done on a partnership approach with the full involvement and commitment of local communities.  Recognising that the commissioners manage many of the most significant heritage landscapes around the country and have a long record of managing the two world heritage landscapes, we anticipate working closely with the Department in any future processes and will seek to make a positive contribution wherever possible.<\/p><p> A provision in the current legislation requires ministerial consent to all works at or near a national monument.  This provision applies equally to monuments in the care of the commissioners and, currently, we must apply to the Department through the normal channels where qualifying works are contemplated.  The time required for a consent process can vary and is determined by the complexity of the proposals.  The Department may seek additional design information, engineering reports etc.  There are provisions in the Bill to rationalise the licence system and reduce the regulatory burden somewhat, including a provision to exempt certain works at registered monuments.  As users of the system and familiar as we are with some of the practical issues involved in meeting the necessary measures to protect monuments, the commissioners welcome these provisions and hope they will streamline our work considerably.<\/p><p> I have, in this short contribution, focused on a small number of matters of direct relevance to the commissioners at the Office of Public Works.  I am conscious that the broader responsibility for the Bill lies with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and I am sure a fuller range of issues will be addressed by him and his officials.  I am happy, however, if members of the committee wish to engage in any supplementary discussions and I hope I can be helpful to them in their consideration of these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Collier","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting the Irish Planning Institute to be with it today.  I am vice-president of the Irish Planning Institute and I will do everything I can to assist the committee with the views of planning professionals regarding the revised general scheme of the monuments and archaeological heritage Bill.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Planning Institute is the all-island professional body representing planners engaged in physical and environmental planning in Ireland.  Our mission is to advance planning in the interest of the common good by serving, improving and promoting the planning profession.  We are the largest professional membership body for spatial planners operating on this island.  Our members work throughout the planning system in planning consultancies and authorities, semi-State organisations, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Office of the Planning Regulator, and central government.<\/p> <p>  The institute wishes to raise the following points in our opening statement.  We strongly support the principle enshrined in head 3(1)(d), performance of functions, that the \"responsibility for the protection of historic heritage is, as a resource of benefit to all, shared by all\".  Those who may be permitted to remove or interfere with historical heritage should, in the normal course, bear the costs of any recording or protective work necessitated by or associated with such removal or interference.<\/p> <p>  This issue can often arise in the context of planning permissions where a site of archaeological potential is involved and conditions are imposed requiring the developer to carry out an archaeological investigation or excavation or monitoring under licence.  Sometimes an argument is made by a developer that the cost of complying with such a condition is onerous or, for example, if an archaeological monument such as a portion of town wall, has to be retained within the development, that it may make the development in question non-viable and that, therefore, the cost should be borne by the State.  The institute believes the imposition of such conditions by planning authorities is appropriate and developers should conform to this principle.  The scheme should make it explicit that the imposition of such conditions, whereby the cost falls on the owner or developer, is within the principles of the Bill and is therefore specifically approved.<\/p> <p>  The institute suggests that under head 9, establishment of register of monuments, any prescribed monument the Minister has entered into the register of monuments should, notwithstanding anything in the planning and development Acts, be deemed to be a protected structure in the relevant development plan.  This measure would deal with the anomaly that currently occurs where the sole means by which a structure is included in the register of protected structures in a development plan is by a vote of the elected members of the planning authority.<\/p><p>The institute is aware that structures deemed to be part of the archaeological or architectural heritage by the Minister are not included in the register of protected structures.  This can sometimes be attributed to opposition on the part of the owners of such structures to the limitations on exempted development and-or additional costs, if the structures are to be altered or demolished, that arise if their properties are protected structures.  The IPI considered these objections invalid in the context of the policy set out in head 3(1)(d).  The IPI suggests that in line with the intention of the scheme, this anomaly should be closed.<\/p><p> In head 13, regarding exemption for certain works to monuments with general protection, it is not clear if the exemption for a licence is provided for in the head where it refers to works being \"regulated under another statutory system\" applies to areas of archaeological protection or works to protected structures under the Planning and Development Acts.  The institute suggests the Department should review and enhance this in the full Bill in order to avoid misinterpretation or weakening the thrust of the scheme.<\/p><p> Head 20 relates to the application of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964.  The provision whereby the Minister \"must be consulted\" appears to be very weak.  If a notice is served under dangerous buildings legislation, in relation to a monument, the institute believes the Minister should be empowered to prohibit its demolition unless the local authority can prove to the Minister's satisfaction, or perhaps with provision for appeal to the High Court, that maintenance, or protection works, which would prevent the demolition or part demolition of the monument are not reasonable or proportionate, or that demolition is otherwise necessary in the public interest.  The stipulations contained in section 79 of the Planning and Development Act, which already controls or sets limits on dangerous buildings legislation in relation to protected structures, should apply in a more significant manner in relation to monuments.<\/p><p> Clarification on the mechanism stipulated in head 30 is needed as it is currently unclear whether the Minister is to be given the power simply to propose world heritage property, leaving it up to the planning authority to incorporate such sites or properties into development plans, or if it is intended that the Minister is to designate such world heritage property, and thereby that such sites or properties are automatically included in the relevant development plans.  This is analogous to the Minister proposing structures of architectural heritage interest through the national inventory of architectural heritage to planning authorities, but such properties not necessarily being included in the register of protected structures in some development plans, as the power to do so is left to the elected members of the authorities.  The institute therefore proposes that, where the Minister designates world heritage property under head 30, the planning authority shall include such sites or properties in the relevant development plan, either by way of a variation, if the plan has been in force for less than four years, or at the next review of the plan concerned after that period.<\/p><p> I thank the Chair for the opportunity to come before the committee today.

As I said in my opening statement, we are clear about what is in the remit of the commissioners.  There is confusing about the designation and status of sites and maybe about where responsibility lies.  We would welcome the same provisions in the Bill as the Heritage Council.  That clarity will be important for the sector and citizens.<\/p> <p>  I included a note in my opening statement about the day-to-day operations which we think will be clarified for the commissioners.  Under the Bill, the operation of national monuments owned by or in the guardianship of the Minister will be the statutory responsibility of the commissioner.  This means that the commissioners will have clear powers and a specific role under the Bill.  This contrasts with the position under the current legislation where there is no express reference to the commissioners and where day-to-day operations are technically vested in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The commissioners are clearly vested with statutory responsibility in the Bill.  That clarity is welcome.<\/p> <p>  Regarding fines or the fixed payment notice system, we will be interested to see how the Bill progresses.  This is a new provision and we need to work through what that means and how it can be made operational in our work.  We will be interested to see how it progresses.  It will take us some time to work through the implications of that and how best to implement it.  We feel that if it is judiciously applied, it could be useful in the protection of the monuments.  There is a civic desire for protection of our national heritage and how we want visitors and the public to engage with our national heritage.  If it is applied judiciously, it will serve that function.<\/p> <p>  There are provisions in the Bill relating to the powers of the Minister to offer guidance about environmental impact assessments and historic heritage, as well as guidance to agencies about historic heritage.  The clarification about that and the relevant powers will be useful.  All boats are rising for heritage with these standards and the quality of guidance that agencies have to work to and be mindful of when caring for and engaging with our national heritage estate.  Those are the key points from the perspective of the Office of Public Works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Collier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":880,"content":"<p>We are a professional planning institute, so our interface with archaeological and heritage monuments is through the planning system and the planning and development Acts.  Like other speakers, we welcome the clarity offered by this proposed legislation.  In terms of the day-to-day work of the planning system, there are obviously two sides to that.  There is the plan-making side and then there is also the development management side of the coin as well.  What the legislation does is it provides streamlining, and the streamlining and understanding of that is very helpful.  From a policy point of view, what is particularly beneficial is the definitions, and the role of the Minister in terms of the register of monuments and the designation of world cultural sites.  That is very helpful.  As part of the development plan process, we often find at local government level in many cases, as I outlined in my opening statement, there are anomalies between what is included on various registers and what ends up in the development plan.  Again, they are public documents.  Development plans are contracts between the local authority in question and the community, the elected members and the executive.  Clarity around all of that is very helpful.<\/p> <p>  From the development management side, when planning applications come in, whether it is for small-scale domestic development in urban centres or large infrastructural projects that might go through rural areas and may have impacts on areas of archaeological sensitivity, clarity around issues like the principle of costs and the burden of that cost and how that is applied is important.  It is often put forward that schemes may be viable or unviable if they encounter archaeological heritage and the cost of recording and monitoring that is an unwelcome burden.  At the same time, it loses sight of the value of our heritage and archaeology.  It provides clarity regarding the importance of that issue.<\/p> <p>  As the previous speaker from the OPW referenced, the environmental impact assessment is especially helpful.

I thank the witnesses for their opening statements, which I very much appreciate.<\/p> <p>  I want to pose questions on two very distinct and separate issues I encounter.  The first is that since the 1990s, there are two fantastic groups in the Chapelizod area, namely, the Chapelizod Tidy Towns group and the Chapelizod Heritage Society.  The person who is central to both of those groups is a man called Peter Kavanagh.  He has been doing extraordinary work on heritage and the preservation of monuments and history in the Chapelizod area.  One of the things they have been attempting to do for the past 25 years relates to the preservation and care of a 5,000 year old cyst or cromlech that is just inside the walls of the Phoenix Park at the Chapelizod pedestrian gate.  This was unearthed in the 1800s.  It is documented and there is a large model of this monument in the Phoenix Park visitors' centre.  When it was unearthed in the 1800s, two human remains were found under it as well as grave articles that are in the National Museum.  The visitors' centre has a mock-up of the monument and a history of it but the item itself remains unpreserved and unlisted.  It is not cared for other than the work done by the heritage society itself, and it is not entitled to intervene where there are splits and cracks from frost damage.  People possibly think it is a picnic table when they see it because it is like a small dolmen, which is how I describe it in my ignorance.  Here we have something that is of considerable heritage value and is a national monument, yet it is sitting there and deteriorating year on year and not being preserved.  What does the Bill do for that and how does it support the 25 years of advocacy on the part of Peter Kavanagh?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is the exemption for religious sites when it comes to monuments and structures.  No one is overseeing the protection of religious sites or religious institutions.  Will the proposed Bill cover modern sites such as residential institutions, industrial schools and Magdalen laundries, particularly as such places certainly reach the threshold of interest?  There may be structures that are of archaeological merit but also within them are graves, both marked and unmarked.  The proposition is that graves should be included in the inventory of national monuments.

The archaeology involves national designation through the Minister whereas the information on the record of protected structures can come from various sources.  The development plan, which has a six-year life, is made by the elected members and the information is collated every four years.  Once the review process starts, there is always an exercise of reviewing the record of protected structures in particular.  It is fair to say that zones of archaeological potential, as they are generally referred to in development plans, do not change very significantly, but any changes are assessed as part of the review process.  The challenge relates to public access to the included information.  All local authorities produce their information digitally online, so that information is available.  However, the Chairman is correct in that part of the issue with local area plans and development plans is that a lot of material goes into them, meaning challenges arise over the level of detail.<\/p> <p>  A development plan is effectively a summary of policies, designations and so forth.  More information sits beneath that.  In a way, the function of the development plan is to raise awareness concerning changes to our natural and built environment, including through public and private sector interventions and projects.  It is really a question of identifying potential sensitivities if sites are to be developed.  That is one side of it.<\/p> <p>  The second side, which is sometimes missed, is that the role of a development plan or local area plan is to identify projects at local level, maybe along the lines referred to by one of the previous speakers.  In this regard, community groups, etc., may be promoting the preservation or conservation of a local archaeological site or protected structure.  Again, it is a matter of achieving consensus.  The planning process is a democratic one and the development plans and local area plans are adopted by the elected members.  When it comes to funding opportunities for projects through LEADER or other such funds, particularly where community groups are involved, the recognition in planning documents of a site or monument identified for a community project as part of what may be a more comprehensive conservation project for a town or village is powerful.  That is the value of the designations and their role within the planning system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Keaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":895,"content":"<p>My next question is for the OPW.

One of the joys of being here is being dragged from pillar to post.  I have not read all of the opening statements but I heard some of the comments made.  I have dealt with the OPW, the Heritage Council and other bodies over the last number of years in regard to some high-profile sites.  I will not dwell on Moore Street today, so they need not worry.  That is a battle for another day and it is before An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in what Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said about the contexts of national monuments, and it is not just that historic landscapes are threatened by climate change but also by human activity, as they have always been threatened.  There are periods in our history and society where it is not just the farmer but also the State that has destroyed some of our monuments, or at least the context in which those monuments exist.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of what happens in the event of the destruction of a monument.  Is it appropriate to reinstate or restore them?  I know that, for example, with certain architectural buildings in the city, people have been forced to rebuild them as was, and Archer&rsquo;s Garage would be an example.  What happens to a monument that has been destroyed, for example, a ring fort?  Do we have the powers or is it desirable to reinstate a ring fort which a builder or farmer, either purposely or unbeknownst to themselves, has interfered with or destroyed?<\/p> <p>  In the previous session, it was mentioned that there are 130,000 national monuments, which is a huge number, and most of them are undiscovered or unavailable to the public.  If we take it there are 1,000 in the care of the OPW, how many are in the care of local authorities?  I presume the rest are on lands belonging to individuals who try to care for them as much as they can, despite the challenge that poses.  If we designate sites as national monuments, does that involve an additional liability in terms of insurance, given there is a duty to care for, preserve and protect a national monument?  If people declare they have a fothrach or a ruin on their land, whether it might be prehistoric, pre-Christian or of whatever designation, they have a duty to protect it.  Climate change was mentioned but there is also the point that something like animal movement can dislodge a brick.  We are facing into a storm in the morning.  Is there a liability on the owner of a national monument, which in many cases is not the State, if something happens to it?  Do they have to restore it or fix it up?  Do they have to spend money?  That is one of the big challenges.  I believe many in the farming community in particular are loath to take on the onerous task of protecting monuments.<\/p><p>They would love to have that duty but it can be an onerous task.<\/p><p> I can come back to anything else.

In general, when a monument is destroyed and damaged, reestablishing the context of the monument, which is frequently where its value lies, is sometimes very difficult, if not impossible.  An architectural site is more tangible sometimes and particularly architectural monuments that go back in time.  I will defer to Mr. Doyle but recent practice, and it is something the Heritage Council is becoming more engaged in, is around the impact of climate change and how we as heritage professionals provide advice and guidance around it.  We develop programmes of recording monuments before destruction happens.  Emerging technologies allow this in very novel ways.  There is the use of virtual reality technologies in some countries to record sites that are vulnerable, especially in coastal areas that are being eroded.  This is something in the future where a voice is important to allow this sort of activity to happen so future generations have at least a knowledge, if not an experience, of what was there before.  Natural disasters will increase.  Our climate is changing.  We need to be prepared for that change.

(1)(c) then speaks somewhat to the Deputy's point, in that \"... [the] removal or alteration of historic heritage should be accompanied by all necessary and appropriate recording of such heritage\".  The approach there is that if something is to be removed, you try to offset or compensate by recording it and by increasing knowledge and understanding of it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right in that the vast majority of monuments in our landscape are privately-owned.  They are in privately-owned fields.  What the State and local authorities own are merely the tip of the iceberg.  The duty or liability on owners to maintain them is very limited at the moment.  It is more on the basis of do no harm.  Normal wear and tear, erosion and weathering generally are not the responsibility of owners.  To support owners, we have for a number of years put in place a system of community archaeologists across the country.  That is Clare, Galway, Sligo, south Dublin, Dublin city, Roscommon, Clare, Donegal and Wicklow this year.

It is an exceptionally complex area and there are differing views.  With our work at the OPW, there would be instances where, for example, high crosses have been taken out of <i>situ<\/i>, taken out of their context, preserved and brought to indoor locations.  More recently, the bells at Howth have been brought into the care of the National Museum because for their protection removing them from context is appropriate.  There are scenarios where taking the national monument out of its context can be done.  Again, it is about the process around the assessment of that, the recording of it, how we share the information around that and how we perpetuate the context for future audiences and generations to be able to appreciate.<br\/><br\/>On national monument sites we care for, we have many instances of properties where the practice has been that how we have inherited them now is the extant value of the national monument site and to preserve and conserve that as we find it now is the principle around conservation.  There will be community groups and differing views where people want to see full conservation or reinstatement and that is not possible with the structure.  Conservation practice around those sites might suggest preserving and conserving them in the condition in which we find them.  Trying to find the layers of the stories and telling the layers of those stories, interpreting it and continuing to record that is more valuable.<br\/><br\/>Climate impact assessment is now hugely important now with our national heritage.  We have done a major project at Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l in terms of a detailed climate impact assessment there.  Again, Ms Teehan referred to coastal and ocean sites that are particularly vulnerable.  It is about the exercise of recording now and understanding the impacts and accepting also - and our colleagues in Historic Environment Scotland would be dealing with this issue hugely - that there are going to be some monuments we are going to lose to the forces of nature and that there is no holding this back.  We have a number of forts in our coastal areas that are especially vulnerable.  In Scotland they have lost particular sites already.  Understanding climate impact, and doing as much as we can now to get ahead with the assessment is really important but also maybe that recording piece and understanding there are parts of what is happening with the climate crisis we will not be able to hold back and not be able to mitigate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Collier"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":930,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Collier.

My first point concerns conservation officers.  We only have one in Limerick.  That is Tom Cassidy.  We also have Sarah McCutcheon.  They are side by side.  We have only half a clerical staff equivalent to assist them.  How are we going to protect our heritage structures and national monuments if we only have one conservation officer dealing with certain sectors within our local authorities?  Our guests have mentioned local authorities.  I meet Mr. Cassidy on a regular basis and he is under severe pressure trying to get to all the monuments.  He will also be retiring in a short number of years.  I am afraid of losing what Mr. Cassidy has.  We must bring it to somebody else who can carry it on, or more people, or an office.  It is like what our guests were saying about recording the national monuments.  We must record what is in these people's heads and the type of information someone like Mr. Cassidy has, and the experience he has so it lives on.<\/p> <p>  The biggest problem I see for Limerick at the moment is we do not have enough people involved in conservation.  It has held up planning permissions and buildings being restored.  I was at one during the week that has been held up for a number of years due to conservation.  I love my heritage, as our guests probably know well.  I love all the monuments that are there and think everything should be protected.  However, the lack of investment in an awful lot of structures in Limerick is the cause of them going into disrepair and beyond repair, so they are not being protected.  We might look at graveyards.  There is no right of way to get to some graveyards in Limerick.  There is a graveyard in Limerick where there is a gate that is in private ownership.  You cannot get to your loved ones.  They are historical graveyards that have been there for many generations but we cannot get the right of ways to get to them.  There is also the repair of iconic buildings within the graveyards, and of the stone walls that have been there for hundreds of years.  They are falling down.  What of the repair of those stone structures?  Where do we get the extra money for us to repair our structures?<\/p><p>If a building is protected or it is significant to the area, how do we get to a place where if the Heritage Council does not have the money to fix it, we can get somebody else who might want to fix it or repair it in such a way that it can be returned to the streetscape and minimise the conservation needed to save the building?  An awful lot of buildings are falling down because they are listed.  We can open them up again by retaining the facades and roof structures facing the street and redeveloping the back of them if it is not economically possible to repair them.  I want to save our streetscapes, our national heritage and monuments that the public regards as iconic so that we can get everyone in to visit them.    <\/p><p> I am also very concerned that there has been no investment in conservation officers and structures that are within the remit.  It is through no fault of their own because they cannot get out to help these projects along with the workload they have.  What can the Heritage Council do about that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#H01600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":933,"content":"<p>It is nice to see the Deputy again.  I worked with Tom Cassidy when I worked in Limerick.  We agree with the Deputy.  We operate the heritage officer programme with the local authorities, the CCMA and the chief executives.  It is one of the most successful heritage programmes.  We would love to see heritage units established in local authorities.  We fully respect the fact that local authorities have lots of demands on them but we experience what the Deputy experiences - an enthusiasm for, interest in and commitment to heritage.  Mr. Doyle outlined the important role that community archaeologists play.  We would like to see community archaeologists, conservation officers, archivists and other heritage professionals employed more fully throughout local authorities because they are all key players in heritage.<\/p> <p>  A bit of good news today is that we have opened a grant scheme called the heritage stewardship fund of almost &euro;1 million.  It applies specifically to heritage professionals working in local authorities and the wider public service because we are aware of the fact that they have very limited access to funding other than their budgets, and local authorities are stretched.  This fund is to support those professionals in the protection of heritage and the conservation of vulnerable places, just as the Deputy has outlined.  We could, and want, to do more and I hope the new policy, Heritage Ireland 2030, which I understand from colleagues in the Department is at an advanced stage, will support the development of more comprehensive heritage management networks across the country.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy has previously raised the issue of graveyards.  We provide and have provided advice on graveyards for communities and provided grants for community groups through our community grant schemes for the protection of graveyards.  It is very worthwhile for us because we see the benefit for both communities and a sense of place and respect for the generations who have gone before us.  Head 27 provides a facility whereby the Minister may vest in local authorities burial grounds the status of which is not clearly resolved.  Some of these are the historic grounds such as those relating to disestablishment of the Church of Ireland that may previously have been historically Roman Catholic grounds.  There is an opaqueness around access to those grounds so this Bill is helpful in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  In summary, we very much welcome the Deputy's comments because they chime very much with our own desires.  The Heritage Council has benefitted considerably through a 40% increase in funding and an increase in staff in the past two years.

In that scenario, it would fall to the Commissioners of Public Works to conserve and preserve that monument.  That is the process we have worked and will continue to work to.  There are provisions that it would be done in consultation.  In assessing the significance of the monuments, the commissioners have a role and engage with the Department in that process but we would play our part downstream of the decision on the designation.<\/p> <p>  It is not that the commissioners are necessarily seeking to take a suite or cohort of monuments that need care.  Deciding that they are of national significance and require that special protection and designation is a matter for the Minister.  Care from the Commissioners of Public Works would follow.

That is how it would come about.<\/p><p> Of course, we should be grateful for the protection of our national monuments and monuments generally.  A diverse collection of organisations, people and communities right across the State protect our national heritage.  They do great work with the Heritage Council and other stakeholders across the sector and we should be grateful to them.  The State cannot do everything so a complex network and selection of organisations are involved.  Our role would absolutely cascade from the statutory provisions in the Bill, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Collier","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":943,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Collier.

The anomaly is that at a local level, the record of protected structures and the function of putting buildings on or off lies with the elected members.  It is fine that there is an exercise in subsidiarity there but I think there is a higher bar when it comes to ministerial designations.<\/p> <p>  For the avoidance of confusion, if the Minister was to designate a monument to be part of the register of monuments under his powers, that should automatically transfer via the Planning and Development Act 2000 and become part of the record of protected structures and, therefore, have that protection under the development plan of the relevant local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Keaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":945,"content":"<p>I will go next to Senator Boyhan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#K00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":946,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman; apologies for being delayed.  I welcome everyone, particularly Ms Virginia Teehan.  Heritage Council representatives have appeared before us very rarely; there have been three outings.  The council really is punching way above its weight and rightly so.  I love the line in Ms Teehan's opening statement: \"The Heritage Council remit is very broad.\"  She is dead on.  It is good to see that.<\/p> <p>  I will address the Heritage Council first.  Ms Teehan talked about the importance of co-ordinating the Irish Walled Towns Network and working with local authorities, which I welcome.  Not today, perhaps, but she might keep the committee abreast of that initiative because it is excellent.<\/p> <p> She raised the issue of the Irish National Strategic Archaeological Research, INSTAR+, programme.  It is a very significant body about which I knew nothing and, therefore, I got my phone out and googled INSTAR+.  I learned very quickly that its remit is cultural identity, territories and boundaries, resources, technology and craft, exchange and trade, religion and ritual, environment and climate change, landscapes and settlement and archaeology and contemporary society.  That was set out in a press statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, who welcomed its establishment at a cost of &euro;2.2 million.  Again, it does not have to be today but Ms Teehan might elaborate on that given that she raised it in her submission.  The committee would benefit from knowing a bit more about that project in the context of where we are.  I will leave it at that in terms of my questions to the council but, again, I am delighted to see its representatives before the committee.<\/p> <p>  The OPW is an amazing organisation.  I know a lot about it and it does amazing things.  I live around the corner from Monkstown Castle, which is one of its responsibilities.  Everyone thinks the council does a great job and I keep reminding them it is done by the OPW.  The OPW sign fell down, however, and no one knows it is that organisation but it is the best kept space around where I live.  I want to pass that on to the people who look after Monkstown Sastle in Baile na Manach.<\/p> <p>  I take on board what Ms Collier said about resources; that is critically important.  On page 7 of her submission, under the heading of World Heritage Convention, Ms Collier said: \"In discussing world heritage sites, I should perhaps point out that the Commissioners have no formal statutory role in the designation of sites\" in the provision of this Bill.  What is her view on this?  Would she like to have a role?  Who would she like to see having a greater role in that regard?  One issue is that the OPW has no resources but if it had the resources, would it like to take that on?  She raised that in her submission; it is really important.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of Part 10, implementation and enforcement, and this sense of uniformity about penalties.  Everyone is singing off the same hymn sheet regarding legislation and the enforcement and implementation of fines.  Ms Collier might touch on that.<\/p> <p> Finally, the IPI is 100% on the ball.  It is an amazing organisation and I compliment Mr. Keaney on the ongoing training and outreach initiatives he does on behalf of the institute.  They are particularly good.  I have attended many of the conferences and have asked him to keep this committee informed of its programme.  It is really interesting and we may take up opportunities to go and participate.<\/p> <p>  The record of protected structures is a reserved function of the elected members of the 31 local authorities and rightly so, and it is about subsidiarity.  They also have local knowledge, however, which is really important.  If we want to be stakeholders with these local authority members, we need to work closely with and empower them.  That is good.<\/p> <p>  In the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I am a former member and which I know best, it does track and map the monuments on its development plan maps.  It has a list; I am not sure if it is a complete one but it endeavours to be.  We have many dolmens in the Dublin mountains and very rich marine heritage in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.   I am not sure if there is an inconsistency but I am only familiar with that authority and that is a model that works well.  Perhaps the idea that Mr. Keaney suggested is one we might take on board because it makes sense.<\/p> <p>  There is a very famous Supreme Court judgment in respect of county development plans, which in simple terms states that it is a contract with the people and citizens.  It is about their expectation for the proper planning and sustainable development of their area.  I will leave it there.  They are really more general comments but the witnesses may have particular responses in the last two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#K00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":947,"content":"<p>Does anybody wish to respond to those comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#K00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":948,"content":"<p>The OPW might kick off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#K00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":949,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his compliments with regard to Monkstown Castle; they are much appreciated.

We are very happy to work with the Department in terms of how the world heritage process works, however.  We participate in the technical group and will do so when it is set up in regard to the tentative list that is being looked at at the moment.  In general terms, we are quite happy with how the process works.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, in terms of ultimate designation, there are implications for the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Senator will understand that we care for the two UNESCO world heritage sites of Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l.  They have a huge requirement in terms of skilled staffing but also a direct labour workforce, who are very expert in the craft skills required to look after these types of sites.  There are, therefore, implications for us in how we do and resource our work and the expert skills that are required.  It is very important that we input to that process but I do not think we have a particularly strong view about having a statutory function.  It was merely just to clarify that we do not and that it is a matter for the Department.  That is the first issue.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is the uniformity of fining under that part of the Bill.  What is attractive to us is the ability to be able to bring in by-laws and that with the permission of the Minister, we can look at a process of enacting by-laws.  Sustainable management of these very vulnerable heritage sites is really important.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, we do not have a full armory in how we can manage those to the optimum.  We do not have the ability to adopt by-laws to be able to regulate issues around parking or where we had issue with dogs in relation to protected species on sites and those kinds of things.  We welcome that Part of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I spoke earlier about the business of how we would implement or operate a system where one can actually identify somebody who has breached something and then fine them.

With all of the housebuilding going on throughout the country, how will developers know when they have triggered the protections of the Bill?  How will they know what to do?  I would welcome the understanding of the witnesses as individuals on their interpretation of this.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question for Mr. Keaney on the Irish Planning Institute's concerns about head 20, which provides for the Minister to be consulted.  I want to understand better why Mr. Keaney feels it is too weak.  I support Senator Boyhan in what he said.  I also attended the annual Irish Planning Institute's conference for a number of years in the past.  I agree this is something that may be quite useful for us as a group to consider attending.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a quick comment on general scheme and why it is so important to communities such as mine.  My constituency is home to the Clondalkin round tower.  It is a national monument of historical significance.  In recent years it has been transformed into a fabulous interactive museum, tourist attraction and popular cafe called East Village.  It has its own gift shop, which sells locally made items such as Tommy Keogh's photographs of the tower.  This transformation was led by South Dublin County Council, spurred on by a vibrant and passionate community, in particular groups such as Rally Round the Tower.  It was done because of the dedication of former councillors, including Breeda Bonner and Tony Delaney.  It was enabled by national funding, which many of us worked across parties to secure.  That same site was once the subject of a controversial planning application.  Proposed legislation such as that before us would prevent that from ever happening again.  What is proposed in the general scheme would preserve such monuments throughout the country and give them the opportunity to become destinations, just like the round tower.  This is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#L00700","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":958,"content":"<p>With regard to the views of the Irish Planning Institute on the relationship between the Act and the impact on housing delivery, as part of any plan-making exercise we consult widely with various Departments.  We have referred to the various registers of monuments.  This information is collated.  We did that in Clonburris, to which Deputy Higgins referred.  At a very simple level when it comes to planning or designing an area we use any existing heritage, for example hedgerows, ring forts or subsurface archaeology, to help shape the form of the urban layout.  If we are aware of an archaeological monument or subsurface archaeology in a large urban extension such as Clonburris they are the areas we designate as open spaces to try to protect them from intensive development.<\/p> <p>  More broadly, all zones of archaeology are lines on maps but in reality the archaeology could extend beyond the boundaries as marked on maps.  As development occurs there are often requirements in planning applications based on advice from the archaeological services whereby we monitor the works.  If anything is uncovered through construction it is investigated and recorded.  These are the protections.  The role of the planning system in the relationship between development of not only housing but all development and archaeology is to raise awareness for landowners and the development sector.<\/p> <p>  As we touched on earlier, one of the important elements of the planning system is the input of subsidiarity and the input of local communities and councillors, and Deputies and Senators, into the plan making process.  It is to raise awareness.  Something that strikes me working in local government is the value that local communities bring to the process.  Often there is a lot of local knowledge that may not necessarily be known in the executive of a local authority because those working in it tend to come from various parts of the country.  This local knowledge is invaluable and it is important to have this input.<\/p> <p>  With regard to head 20, we raised it with regard to the issue of dangerous buildings legislation.  We often have a situation in which an historic property is flagged and ends up on a record as a dangerous building.  The implication, therefore, is that the building or structure must be removed.  On this particular issue, the general scheme states that the Minister must be consulted.  We believe this should be strengthened.  The Minister should have the power to prohibit the demolition of a national monument because of its designation of national importance.  The wording should be tightened up to give the Minister greater power on this.  To make a plug for the institute and our conference on 7 and 8 April in Kilkenny, we welcome engagement with elected members at all levels.

The round tower, some imagination and partnership has done this.  I can think of a number of projects throughout the country that have done this.  It is the transformative power of heritage to give a place a stronger meaning.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked how the proposed legislation helps to support this and mentioned housing in particular.  There is a line in the 1930 Act about archaeological licensing.  This was written at a time when a professor in a university might go and excavate at Lough Gur for six weeks over the course of the summer.  We now have projects, such as those mentioned by the Deputy or complex housing projects, that have archaeological strategies to enable excavation and to enable leaving some finds <i>in situ<\/i>to preserve them for future generations.

I thank Mr. Doyle.<\/p> <p>  I will move to the OPW.  I am going to speak about a specific location and I appreciate that the witnesses may not be fully up to speed on the matter.  Most of the heritage sites and locations are high-profile locations right across the country.  On the islands in Lough Ree, we have a number of very significant sites.  I will speak specifically to Inchcleraun, an old monastic settlement in the heart of Lough Ree.  It is not a million miles from where I grew up.  There are a number of landowners, probably no more than two or three, who still have rights on the island.  There is some concern about some vandalism to the structures on the site, and some of those structures are 800 or 900 years old.  There is an element of camping there as well, which probably is not appropriate.<\/p> <p>  In the context of OPW's focus, what is the position regard the islands of Lough Ree?  Who looks after them?  Is there a dedicated team within the OPW for such work or is it just added to somebody's duties?  If a landowner wanted to work in conjunction with the OPW and look to turn back the clock by introducing native rare breed cattle to the island, such as there may have been on the island 400 or 500 years ago, is there an opportunity for the landowner to work with the office to safeguard and enhance an obvious visitor experience at the location?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#M00900","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645056000,"counter":972,"content":"<p>Deputy Emer Higgins took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I do not have the specific details of the site referred to by the Deputy, but he has touched on a matter I can speak about and which may explain some related issues.  There was vandalism of the site recently, which is really unfortunate and should not happen.  We have been cognisant of that in recent years and there was a little bit of an uptick in such activity during the pandemic because of the increased number of people visiting heritage sites.  Anecdotally or generally speaking, damage to national monuments has declined in recent years, at least as far as we are aware.<\/p> <p>  Last year, in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we ran a campaign called Protect Our Past to try to tackle vandalism.  I hope it can help in light of what happened at Lough Ree.  The campaign ran during the summer in general and standard media, as well as online.  We used a variety of digital platforms on which to put the message.  The idea was to get people to appreciate such sites.  We firmly believe that we must educate people about this because using threats does not get us anywhere.  That was the aim of the campaign.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to know the reach achieved as a result of a campaign in standard media and newspaper advertising.  On the digital side, we know it had a reach of approximately 2.2 million people.  We think and hope it had an impact.  There were one or two high-profile incidents in the past two years involving damage done to monuments.  Generally speaking, such activity is not wilful; it is mindless more than anything else.  I hope that campaign will assist in some way in protecting sites such as those on Lough Ree.  I will revert to the Deputy with information on the site and plans for it.<\/p> <p>  The site comes under one of our teams in the western area.  There is a conservation architect and depots of our general operatives in the west of Ireland.  My colleague, Ms Collier, mentioned that some of the sites we have are inaccessible and island properties pose different problems with respect to access and the time it takes to get to them and back, etc.  They are challenging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":974,"content":"<p>I can certainly appreciate issues of access but within Lough Ree we have a real treasure trove.  I mentioned Inchcleraun; we also have Saint's Island and Quaker Island.  Many of these sites date back to the earliest Christian times.  There has clearly a large uptake in boating and I am thankful that people are much more appreciative of our waterways.  People are getting out to them much more.  There is a timely opportunity for us to try to do something now with these sites.  They have been very much a forgotten part of our heritage portfolio because not many people are familiar with them unless they are from the area.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting to hear Mr. Moore say this falls under the remit of the part of the office dealing with the western region.  It clearly has a significant body of work to do as well.  With the islands in Lough Ree and other inland islands, is there an opportunity for a dedicated small team of perhaps two to three people to deal with this as a project and safeguard these sites of intrinsic value before they deteriorate further?  Such a team could, where possible, work with local landowners who want to come forward with projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#M01200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":975,"content":"<p>We are delighted to work with local communities and landowners.

That local partnership is critical to how we protect monuments, particularly those that are in very remote or inaccessible locations.<\/p> <p>  We will certainly look at the idea mentioned by the Deputy of having a dedicated team.  The inland islands have extraordinary and particular heritage that must be looked after.<\/p><p>The challenge is resourcing.  The conservation architect who looks after inland islands, the fantastic Ms Michele O'Dea, also looks after all the islands off the coast of Mayo as well as Donegal, Sligo and Galway, so she has a huge geographic area under her remit.  We will take Deputy Flaherty's comments away with us and look at whether there is a specific project for the inland islands.  Again, however, it comes back to the resourcing challenge.<\/p><p> Deputy Flaherty mentioned a native breed of cattle and working with landowners.  The OPW has developed a biodiversity strategy for the organisation, which we will launch shortly.  It cascades from the national biodiversity action plan.  One of the core elements and objectives of the strategy is to make sure we undertake detailed biodiversity audits and studies of our sites.  In that context, we would in time be happy to look at the island sites the Deputy mentions, to undertake a detailed biodiversity study of them and to look at recommendations as to what could be achieved there.  If there is an appropriate recommendation on the introduction of particular breeds of cattle, we would be happy to look at that, but the strategy cascades from the assessment and the audit in the first instance.  We did a year-long biodiversity audit at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in with Professor Jane Stout, and one of the recommendations of the audit was to look at the introduction of a particular rare breed of cattle.  We would be happy to engage further on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#M01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Collier","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":977,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Collier.

As always, I welcome their insights and wisdom.  I confirm I am on campus.<\/p> <p>  I concur with Deputy O'Donoghue's comments.  I think we are all in the same position.  I note that South Dublin County Council has only one conservation officer and that she deals with the county's record of protected structures, RPS, grants; protected structure applications; architectural conservation areas, ACAs; and national monuments.  Therefore, I think the issue of resourcing is a countrywide one.<\/p> <p>  I have spent most of my professional practice working on protected structures.  The Bill, and any action that seeks to celebrate and protect our built heritage, is great and welcome.  I believe, as do all the witnesses, I think, that our heritage is extremely important as it provides us with a reference point.  It is our identity.  My experience has shown me we have dedicated and passionate heritage officers.  Certainly, the ones I have worked with are dedicated and passionate.  The witnesses' contributions and institutions also illustrate care for and protection of our country's cultural heritage.  The big issue, however, is the lack of resources and funding.  That has always been the problem.<\/p> <p>  My questions are based on discussions I have had with heritage and architectural conservation officers from various local authorities.  As the Chair noted, the witnesses' answers will help our report and help to amend the Bill and to make it better, so I would be grateful for their insight on the following issues.  I will direct my questions initially at Mr. Keaney for his views, considering his IPI and local authority roles and his boots on the ground locally.<\/p> <p>  First, an issue for local authority architectural conservation officers and for the Bill is the possible additional responsibility placed on local authority staff for the changes relating in particular to sites in local authority ownership being given special protection, thereby putting more responsibility on the local authority reaquisition, ownership and maintenance functions.  This points to the need for additional funding supports to increase capacity.  The Bill proposes to move all graveyards into local authority ownership.  This, I imagine, would represent a significant burden on all those local authorities.  Are the witnesses aware if additional funding will or can be provided for care, conservation and an increasing staff capacity?  The Bill also provides an opportunity to increase expertise in local authorities.  I refer in particular to the need for county archaeologists and county heritage officers.  Should that be enshrined in this legislation?  We need to improve management and protection of our UNESCO sites, and this Bill should provide for that.  Furthermore, there is no protection in legislation of archaeological landscapes.<\/p> <p>  Second, archaeological complexes should be retained on the record of monuments and places, RMP.  Sites such as the Curragh are composed of a large number of RMP sites.  Therefore, the complex itself should be its own site in order that the larger whole is protected.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, the Bill should provide for a legislative requirement for a national heritage plan and county heritage plans to ensure the conservation and protection of our country's heritage.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Keaney might start and give us some feedback on that and on how it might then go into our report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#N00400","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":979,"content":"<p>The issue of resources, be it in the planning departments or with conservation officers or archaeologists, is critical.  I think we all welcome the legislation because it will streamline, as we discussed earlier, the processes surrounding the designation of sites.  From a planning point of view, it is a matter of greater clarity on the licensing process and its relationship with the planning consents.  All of that is most welcome.  There will be a consequential impact in the sense that if more and more sites are brought into a consent process, there has to be greater expertise.<\/p> <p>  In the area of archaeology, in my current role I have spoken to my colleague in Dublin City Council.  I think there are six or maybe seven city archaeologists around the country and they all have various roles.  Outside of the city councils, we are effectively relying on the expertise in the Department.  It is a big issue and should probably be addressed more broadly by the Department, but it is important the committee is aware that there will be a greater resource requirement there, particularly in the area of archaeology.<\/p> <p>  As for conservation, my understanding from my role in local government is that most local authorities in the urban areas have conservation officers.  Again, once one moves out of the urban areas, I think the coverage becomes a lot patchier.  Then we also have heritage officers, who perform an important role.  I think they are represented across nearly all our local authorities.  As Deputy Duffy says, this shines a light on how we as a society value our heritage, be that archaeology, built heritage or natural heritage.  The issue then is how resources are addressed.  The enactment of this legislation will generate demand at local authority level.  The Irish Planning Institute relies on the expertise of our archaeologists, conservation officers and heritage officers as part of both the plan-making exercise and the development management process, as with the private sector, members of the institute, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the semi-State sector etc.  They are a vital cog in the whole policy apparatus of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Keaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":980,"content":"<p>Has Mr. Keaney seen signs coming from the Department that resources will be made available to resource those counties?

The increased employment of conservation officers and archaeologists specifically for this Bill is important.  In securing that, one pending good sign is the introduction of Heritage Ireland 2030, which will be a national heritage plan.  It is not referred to in this Bill but it is a piece of work that has been developed by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I understand it is at a very advanced stage.  Equally, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has confirmed that there is funding from the national development plan to facilitate the implementation of Heritage Ireland 2030.  I will not give a figure for this because I do not know the exact amount off the top of my head.  That strongly focuses on supporting local authorities in developing increased capacities for personnel in heritage.  Our experience in the Heritage Council is that we operate the heritage officer programme, in conjunction with the local authorities.  We also provide annual funding to each local authority for a county heritage plan, which Deputy Duffy referred to.  This funding must be increased significantly.<\/p> <p>  Currently, we operate seven major grant schemes, five of which are directed towards local authorities and that is only a drop in the ocean.  The funding needs to be significantly increased.  It is wonderful that this Government has certainly significantly increased funding for heritage.  Much work needs to be done and it needs to be focused on getting in the right people.  This monuments and archaeological heritage Bill requires the engagement of professional archaeologists as employees of the State and not the contracting out of this work.  This is no disrespect to the private sector but we need the human capacity to be built into the State infrastructure and into local authorities on the ground.

This question is in some ways in respect of funding because recently the restoration of the Magazine Fort, for instance, was announced and it is welcome.  I have written a small piece for History Ireland welcoming this development.  It is often when projects such as this are announced that a budget is set aside.  Sometimes, however, we forget that the budget is not enough and that additional resources may be needed.  For instance, the OPW then has to divert personnel and everything else to a big project such as this, where the budget may not be the exact amount that is required and may be a great deal more, as we know.  I just had an extension put on the mother-in-law&rsquo;s house and it cost me a third extra and that was just last year, and I am still paying for it.<\/p> <p>  In such instances such as large projects, and I believe Ms Teehan mentioned the making of places with these projects, because it is not just the restoration and the looking after it but it is also the setting out of it so that the public can enjoy it.  That is part of what the role is.  It is a big undertaking and most of these sites in the past were not self-sufficient, did not pay for the work that was put into them or, necessarily, their upkeep.  How do we ensure in legislation that we give that protection?  Can we do so or is it a case of the annual Estimates process, as Ms Collier has just referred to?<\/p> <p>  Finally a question arose in which the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, was very helpful and it is not even in my constituency but it is on the edge of it, namely, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral.  Covid-19 hit and all of a sudden nobody was visiting the cathedral and it was very substantially down in its funding.  It was also in the middle of a restoration project on its roof which is costing some &euro;9 million.  The cathedral could not apply for the normal grants because it is a functioning church or ecclesiastical site, even though we would all regard it as a national monument.  <\/p> <p>  People would have a view on this.  Many of our cathedrals are like this.  The church on Meath Street was damaged, as well as a church in Kilkenny.  We all regard them as national treasures although they may not all necessarily be national monuments.  There may be a blockage in their ability to apply for grants to restore them in the event of damage or, as in the case of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, where this was an outcome of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Thankfully, the Minister of State stood in and the congregation and others were then in a position to finish their project.  This is one of the things we should consider as there should not be a blockage for them in seeking restoration grants due to the fact that they are still in use today.  Their functionality should not have to be in the past tense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#O00600","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I have just clarified with Mr. Doyle.

Many of our finest craft and art workers have their work and legacies represented in churches, church buildings and places of worship across the country.  These now, for a variety of reasons, are no longer used as churches.  I, certainly, and the Heritage Council are aware of this area and of a need to address the long-term protection of some of these important works.<\/p> <p>  There is a very good example of practice in Nano Nagle Place in Cork where a religious foundation of the Presentation Sisters - indeed the original site where Nano Nagle set up her first convent in a very poor part in the centre of Cork city at the end of the 18th century - has been brought back into use with both an interpretative centre, a social housing use, and a very popular and attractive shop and caf&eacute;.  This was a very imaginative use by this religious order of a site that is important to it and is important in the centre of and a part of the city that may not be wealthy.  These are answers which need to be delivered upon and it is something that is important.<\/p> <p>  More generally then, around Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s other issues on how this Bill can support that, I believe that these are broader heritage issues.  Heritage protection in its own right, has been a case of where at times in Ireland, particularly outside big key heritage sites like the ones that perhaps our colleagues in the OPW manage, are seen exclusively for their commercial and tourism potential.  We in the Heritage Council have discovered that their value to the communities is in the sites themselves.  Their pure heritage value matters a great deal.  They are part of the life of a place.  Where one sees a scheme such as one to adopt a monument, we have great examples - I believe, Deputy Higgins, was talking about Clondalkin - all across the country of places that are important to people.<\/p><p>Money needs to go to protecting that sense of importance of the place, not for commercial gain but because they are important for citizens.

We already discussed the provisions in the Bill that expenditure is to come from a Vote of the Oireachtas.  Stakeholders in the sector and we in the OPW will try to use funding to ensure that we address the complexities of the rich tapestry we have across the State.  The Heritage Council referred to the attention to tourism and the commercial side.  That would never traditionally have been the motivation of the OPW, which would have been about conservation and preservation.  We are very conscious that sites like Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, Newgrange, the Rock of Cashel and Kilkenny Castle play a very important role not only in local place making but also for the local economy and local tourism.<\/p> <p>  We need to use the available funding through strategic partnerships with partners like F&aacute;ilte Ireland on shared objectives where one objective is not taking priority over another.  We need to meet the very clear conservation and preservation requirements while also delivering on the tourism and economic agendas.  It is really important that stakeholders in the sector find a way to create those partnerships.  We feel that we have done that very successfully with the tripartite strategic partnership between us, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  There is a multitude of approaches.  The rural regeneration schemes are also important.<\/p> <p>  Many of the sites in the care of the OPW fundamentally define our local towns and local places.  They are very important for people's sense of place and sense of well-being.  During the pandemic the engagement of local people with their national heritage was extraordinary.  We need to marry the objective of supporting the economic agenda in vibrant rural communities with the conservation and preservation agenda.  We are seeing some very good work being done at places like Nenagh Castle and Trim Castle.  We will use the armoury of different funding opportunities, but it is fundamentally about the quality of the partnership to achieve those kinds of shared objectives.  The plan certainly gives the kind of robust legislative framework for what is required throughout the estate.

We welcome the clarity in the heads of the Bill.  I wish to reiterate the five key points from my opening statement which the committee should bear in mind as it considers the next stage of the legislation.  On the issue of the developer bearing the cost of archaeological investigation, excavation or monitoring as part of the development process, the potential threat to remove archaeological or heritage features on the grounds that keeping them would render a scheme unviable is somewhat addressed as part of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I answered questions earlier on designations.  If at national level the Minister designates or introduces a feature in the register of monuments, that has the status of a protected structure as it would be in a development plan so that automatically transfers across.  There is a clear link between the ministerial designation and the inclusion of that feature or monument as part of the development plan record of protected structures.<\/p> <p>  Clarity on exemptions from the requirement for archaeological licensing goes to the heart of the development management process.  All works under the Planning and Development Acts, either carried out on or under the land, or making a material change trigger the requirement for planning consent.  Within that there are exemptions.  People will know that a single-storey extension to a domestic dwelling of less than 40 sq. m does not need planning permission in theory subject to conditions.  Our concern here is the reference to exempting certain works from planning consent by virtue of the fact that they are licensed under another regime.  We need clarity on that; there may not be an issue.<\/p> <p>  Where works are being done to a national monument, the first port of call is usually to raise the issue with the local authority which is the planning authority.  We again need to get clarity on that issue.  If exemptions are to be granted under this legislation, how do they interface with the Planning and Development Acts and regulations?  <\/p> <p>  The heads of the Bill refer to the role of the Minister in respect of a dangerous building.  If a national monument is classified as a dangerous building, the legislation should be changed to give the Minister greater powers to intervene to prohibit the demolition of or works to a national monument irrespective of whether it is classified as a dangerous structure.  We again seek clarity on that.<\/p> <p>  We also seek clarity on the designation by the Minister of a world heritage property and what that means for the development plans.  As with the register of monuments, if the Minister decides to designate a property as a world heritage property, that protection is automatically brought into the development plan process.  Those are the five points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Keaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":996,"content":"<p>We welcome head 27 which provides a facility whereby the Minister may vest in local authorities burial grounds whose status is currently unclear.  This point was raised earlier in the committee.  We believe it is good to rationalise that.<\/p> <p>  We also welcome head 30 containing measures to assist the implementation of the 1972 convention concerning the protection of the world cultural heritage and natural heritage.  We welcome the clearer understanding of that world convention and the rationalisation of inserting protective mechanisms in a county development plan.  We think that is a very good move.<\/p> <p>  Under head 39, we note and support the continued restriction on the use of metal detection devices.  As we said in our opening statement, in 2018 we commissioned RED-C to carry out a survey of the public attitudes to archaeology in Ireland.  When it came to the protection of archaeological remains, only 30% of the population knew that it was illegal to search for archaeological objects with a metal detector without a licence from the Government.  This is an issue for the protection of our heritage.  A large proportion of the people believe that this should be restricted to ensure that the archaeological objects do not fall into private collections and that monuments are not damaged.<\/p> <p>  Under head 66 we welcome the statutory footing for the Archaeological Survey of Ireland.  That work has proven its importance in recent years.  We think that is essential and will support the management of archaeological sites.  Earlier we mentioned the context of these sites and the setting of archaeological monuments in the landscape.  I reiterate the point made earlier on the importance of the national landscape strategy should that emerge as a result of this Bill when enacted.<\/p><p>We also note the approach taken, specifically in head 86, on the \"promotion in knowledge and awareness\" of archaeological heritage in keeping with a more progressive practice around individual and community ownership of heritage as well as public engagement.  This has not been as evident in previous drafts of the Bill, because it was very much around protection.  We welcome this overall tone and approach.  Finally, we noted earlier, as we did in our submission, that we are concerned about the absence of any reference to the role of the Heritage Council in the Bill.  We are an independent advisory body.  Under the previous legislation, we were given the responsibility to assume the powers of the previous National Monuments Advisory Council.

We have had a good opportunity to set out for members our thoughts on particular issues.  To start, we welcome this Bill and the clarity that it will bring where there are overlapping provisions for the protection of monuments going forward.  There will also be clarity about the role of the OPW and the Commissioners of Public Works.  It is fully described now whereas there was a lack of clarity in the existing legislative framework.  The legislation to enable Ireland to ratify key conventions is important as well.<\/p> <p>  We have talked through most of them, but just as a summary, under head 15, exemption of certain works to monuments\" the proposal to exempt certain works for licensing processes is particularly welcome, as is head 17, exemption from EIA requirements.  However, I accept Mr. Keaney's point about the clarity around where that intersects with the Planning and Development Act is critical.  Again, we feel that an exemption would be welcome or should apply where there is a real risk to the health and safety of the public or where emergency works are needed to protect the integrity of a national monument.  While I accept the point Mr. Keaney made on clarity, there might be valid reasons that provision would be most helpful. <\/p> <p>  On head 26,  functions of the commissioners in respect of national monuments, there is just a small issue.  We feel that it does not adequately describe the current role of the commissioners.  We suggest a small amendment, which is about having regard to the Minister's policies and priorities, the ongoing, care, management, maintenance conservation and day-to-day operation.  The words used in the head at the moment are quite flat regarding the day-to-day operation and, therefore, an amendment there might be useful for clarification.<\/p> <p>  There is also a little bit of an inconsistency between heads 25 and 26 regarding ministerial functions.  Head 25 provides that the Minister is &ldquo;to maintain the archaeological, architectural, artistic, historic and traditional interest of a registered monument of which he\/she\/it is owner or guardian\" but, of course, the commissioners fulfil the function of maintenance.  This is, again, about clarity, rather than us having a particular concern.<\/p> <p>  On the functions of the commissioners in respect of national monuments and by-laws\"under head 26, again, we welcome this provision.  We know that it requires further consideration.  Again, the judicious implementation of it will be where we will most intersect with it downstream of the Bill.   Head 29, enforcement of easements and covenants, is welcome but again will require further consideration as the Bill goes through the Houses.  Under head 80, we made an observation to our colleagues on the \"cost of prosecutions and civil proceedings and recovery of debts\".  We assume that this provision relates to all proceedings that might be taken under the legislation and that it is not limited to proceedings that might arise from an enforcement notice.  Some clarity on the enforcement notices is needed, because local authorities do not seem to be identified under head 77 as one of the bodies with powers to issue these notices.  Some clarity might be required on heads 77 to 80, inclusive.  That is the summary of our observations.  Again, we welcome the Bill.  I will conclude by saying that we have a good working relationship with our colleagues in the Department in caring for our national monuments.  We look forward to continuing to work with it in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022021700002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosemary Collier"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Collier and the OPW for everything that they do.

The focus of planners and the planning system is on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021 but I go back to the point that there is a critical interface between this Bill and that Act.  I am speaking on behalf of the planning profession.  Heritage is valuable to the planning system and that should not be understated.  One of our contributors also mentioned the value of place-making.  Plan-led place-making is at the heart of the IPI&rsquo;s policy position in how the planning system is evolving and changing.  We are moving away from a site-by-site and development-led approach to planning towards a more wholesome and plan-led approach that then gets input from various stakeholders as we discussed today, be they communities, elected members, landowners or developers.  It is important to recognise that heritage is one of those key stakeholders and is a key driver in terms of place.  How we treat our heritage goes to the heart of what we value as a country and society.  That is reflected in our plans and place-making and I want to reiterate that point.<\/p> <p>  The planning system, like all legislation and processes is a bit like democracy in that it continues to evolve.  Speaking from the point of view of planners, we are keen that we embrace and work with our heritage colleagues to deliver better plans and to respond in the context of sustainable development to the future needs of society.  Heritage is a key element of that.  I echo the comments of the other speakers and I wish the committee well in the next Stage of the legislative process.

As members of the committee will know, in April 2021, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, Nichola Mallon MLA, announced the launch of an all-island strategic rail review.  The scope of that review overall was that the all-island strategic rail review will consider how the rail network on the island of Ireland can improve sustainable connectivity between major cities, enhance regional accessibility; support balanced regional development, consider the feasibility of higher speeds on the network and whether there is a potential to increase use of the network for freight.<\/p> <p>  Before I address these matters from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s perspective, I will briefly outline the process and governance associated with the review, as established by the Department of Transport and Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.  Arup Consultants were appointed by the Departments as consultants for the review and work on the review formally commenced in late August-early September 2021.  The review&rsquo;s scope included: setting the context, the opportunities and the constraints, which include the public consultation process; identification of service level scenarios; definition of short-listed service level scenarios and final appraisal; and a final report, which it is expected will be completed by quarter 4 of the current year. <\/p> <p>  In terms of governance, two oversight groups have been established for the review, which both incorporate representatives from the Departments, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the National Transport Authority, NTA, Translink and EIB.  The project management group meeting, referred to as the PMG, is the first line of review for outputs from the review.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s participation in this group is led by my colleague, Peter Muldoon, director of capital investments, who is with me today.  The high-level steering group forms the main oversight of the review.  It includes the bodies referenced above as well as the Commission for Railway Regulation, and I sit on this steering group on behalf of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  While the committee will appreciate that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is contributing to the groups above, the two Departments, North and South, are ultimately responsible for the review and for the policy decisions which arise.  That said, I would like to give the committee Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s perspective on some of the issues being considered within its scope as well as recent developments which support some of the ambitions within the scope.  I will take three elements of the scope together, namely, improving sustainable connectivity between the major cities, enhancing regional accessibility and supporting balanced regional development, as there is some overlap.  For sustainable connectivity between the major cities and enhancing regional accessibility, we can deliver this most effectively through higher frequency, improved journey times and reducing the carbon emissions of our operations.  Throughout the decade 2000 to 2010, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was in a position to demonstrate clearly the benefits of higher frequency across our network.  Enhancing rail services on all our InterCity routes, including, for example, hourly to Cork-Limerick and two-hourly to Kerry, eight times daily to Sligo and others, dramatically increased demand, and journey time improvements also supported the process.<\/p> <p>  Our ambition under Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Strategy 2027 is to again enhance frequency and line speeds.  To that end, current projects which will help achieve this ambition include: the DART+ programme, by building the capacity of our infrastructure, through measures such as completing the four-tracking of the line between ParkWest and Heuston Station, and other signalling and city centre capacity issues; the DART+ fleet, by freeing up InterCity railcars currently in use on commuter services to increase frequency and capacity on InterCity services; support under the PEACE PLUS programme for a new Enterprise fleet to allow hourly services between Dublin and Belfast; the Cork line renewal programme by renewing track and the track bed to facilitate improved speeds for journeys to Cork, Kerry and Limerick; and regional city investment, on which I will expand shortly.  In addition, a programme to convert our InterCity railcar fleet, currently diesel operated, to hybrid operation is progressing well and will reduce emissions further by more than 35% on that fleet.  In the longer term, continuing electrification beyond the greater Dublin area, further double-tracking and the addition of passing loops and other infrastructure investment will help achieve these ambitions. <\/p> <p>  As well as inter-urban travel, enhancing rail services in and around our major cities is also critical to supporting balanced regional development.  It is heartening to see these programmes accelerate, with support at Exchequer and EU level, including: under the European Recovery and Resilience Programme, &euro;185 million has been allocated to Cork commuter rail, which will include resignalling, a new through platform at Kent Station and double-tracking Glounthaune to Midleton; the full Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, CMATS, plans to expand all three commuter rail lines into Cork will follow, including further capacity, new stations and a move to electrification; almost &euro;50 million of urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, funding for two projects in Galway: the redevelopment of Ceannt Station as part of the development of a major transport hub in the city centre and the provision of a second platform and passing loop at Oranmore to increase frequency on this increasingly popular route; the review of the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS, in the context of maximising the usage of both existing and disused railway lines around Limerick city; and delivering the relocated Plunkett Station in Waterford, providing for public transport integration and future frequency improvements as part of the Waterford North Quays development.<\/p> <p>  In terms of considering the feasibility of higher speeds on the network, as I mentioned, further improving journey time is a major part of our strategy to increase demand.  Higher speeds &ndash; at a minimum reducing journey times between Dublin and all our major cities to under two hours &ndash; are a priority for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  In railway terms, there is a differentiation between &ldquo;high speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;higher speed,&rdquo; with the former typified by services such as the TGV in France or the Shinkansen in Japan.  These services operate generally in excess of 250 km\/h, operate on exclusively developed lines, do not serve smaller, intermediate stations and link large, densely populated urban areas.  The business cases involved differ markedly from higher speed, which involves upgrading infrastructure to enhance line speeds and with electrification improving acceleration and deceleration also.  Upgrading existing lines to 200 km\/h operation is something which is feasible and achievable, and would strengthen our journey time competitiveness significantly. <\/p> <p>  Regarding the potential to increase use of the network for freight, we are ambitious for our rail freight services to become a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s freight sector and welcome the Departments' inclusion of rail freight within the review&rsquo;s scope.  In 2021, we published our Rail Freight 2040 strategy, which sets out a clear path to make this happen.  Rail Freight 2040 aims to achieve: a fivefold increase in the number of rail freight services to include more than 100 new weekly services across the rail network; a resulting reduction of 25,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, with rail freight emissions per unit as little as 16% of heavy goods vehicle, HGV, emissions; and avoiding the requirement for 140,000 HGV journeys on our roads annually as well as helping the supply chain which is facing a shortage of HGV drivers. <\/p> <p>  The strategy outlines 25 initiatives and a cumulative investment of approximately &euro;500 million out to 2040, with five strategic pillars, which are: enhancing connections with sea ports - enhancing existing operations to Waterford and Dublin Ports and re-establishing rail connections to Foynes Port in Limerick and Marino Point in Cork; developing a network of inland intermodal terminals - an expansive network of inland rail freight terminals is proposed, establishing rail freight in each of the regions; addressing rolling stock requirements by investment in new wagon fleets and bi-mode locomotives would allow for further decarbonisation of freight flows; network development - the connectivity of industrial sites directly to the rail network and development of additional passing loops and double-tracking on current single-track sections of the network; and policy initiatives - working with national, regional and European stakeholders, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will work to ensure a policy framework is in place to support a more favourable environment for rail freight in line with European norms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Meade"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Meade for his presentation.

I will start with where we are with LSMATS.  We made a comprehensive submission, as the Deputy rightly said.  We put on the table the options that we believe should be considered to enhance public transport, as part of a public transport solution for the greater Limerick area.  That submission has been made and we are eagerly awaiting the NTA publishing the consultation process.  The timeline is the NTA's, not ours.  Once that is published, we will not be found wanting in making our commentary on it.  If we believe there are other additions that should be included, we will say so.  My colleague, Mr. Muldoon, is with me today.  His section looks after that.  Together, we have worked closely on making comprehensive submissions on this and, indeed, on other local authority transport plans across the country.  We are looking at having a network of new stations and park and ride.  We fully understand that this cannot happen in the one year.  It will happen over time, once we are building towards an endgame that utilises the infrastructure that is there.  We believe it is the correct direction to take.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned Ballycar and I am aware of the meeting he had.  The chair of the OPW gave an undertaking at that meeting to sit down and discuss the next steps with me, which we have done.  We are now setting up a session with the OPW and Clare County Council to understand the next steps.  The Deputy will be aware that there is an agreed solution for the location.  The next steps are how it is funded and who takes the lead on it.  We will agree that at the next meeting.  I am happy to report that.<\/p> <p>  Crusheen has been on the cards for a while, but it is part of the county development plan.  We will build it once somebody agrees it and funds it.  We are happy to move forward with it.  The biggest issue for us is the planning process we have to go through with some of these projects.

In terms of enhanced regional accessibility, this is an all-island plan and, when we look to the west and the north-west, it has been a function of political priorities and politics and investment over years.  Does Irish Rail have ambition in its submission?  Has it made commentary on rail services in that region?  Has it worked with colleagues in Translink on that?  We literally have one cross-Border rail line.  Does Irish Rail envisage that changing and, if so, what might it look like?  I have heard talk of the continuation of the Navan rail line to County Donegal, for example.  I have heard other commentary, including from the Minister at one of our meetings last week, about the possibility of a spur at Newry with the line going across that way.  Does Mr. Meade have an opinion on that?<\/p> <p>  What has been the experience so far on rail freight?  Did Irish Rail reopen rail freight to Dublin Port and then close it?  What was the experience in that regard?  How will it be different in the future?<\/p> <p>  Does Irish Rail consider offshore wind energy to be a driver for a new dispensation in rail, be that in terms of economies or freight?  I refer in particular to the western economic corridor and the western seaboard wrapping around to the Port of Waterford.  Is that on the horizon?  I have two further specific questions.  What are the prospects of opening the Killucan station in County Westmeath, which my colleague, Deputy Clarke, raised with me and which was in the news in recent days?  Does Mr. Meade have an update on the Navan rail project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#C01000","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>It is important to note that we work very closely with Translink, and I understand that my opposite number, Mr. Chris Conway, made a submission to this committee on that.  We are working closely on service provision.  We are looking at replacing the entire Enterprise fleet with the assistance of some Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, funding under the peace process.  That would move us to an hourly service all day, which we do not have on that line at present.  We believe there is demand for an hourly service.  There is close connectivity between the two companies and it works very well.<\/p> <p>  On the expansion and recommendation of routes, all options are being considered and that is what Arup is doing.  It is looking at the various areas that could be connected, how those connections could work and what the recommendations would be.  Arup has not come back on that piece to the group that Mr. Muldoon is on or to us on the steering group.  That is a work in progress.  It is part of work package 1, which they are doing.  As we progress through the process, that will become more apparent.  They will look at where those connections should and should not be, and short-list the viable ones.  From that point of view, it is very much a work in progress.  The Deputy mentioned Navan and connectivity beyond the existing network.  That is being considered as part of it.<\/p> <p>  We believe there is a great opportunity for freight.  As I said in my statement, we published our strategy last year.  We move approximately 1% of the freight that moves on the island and we believe we should be in double digits and we need to grow to double digits.  Any containerised traffic that moves by rail reduces the carbon footprint of that individual container by 75%.  In some ways it is a no-brainer.  We are looking to reconnect to the ports, which is part of our overall plan.  It dovetails with the LSMATS for Shannon Foynes Port Company.  That is a port that has a lot of capacity and it will have further capacity in the future once we reconnect.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Port was referred to.  We had an issue last year in that the port was at capacity.  It is struggling with capacity.  It is the major port on the island of Ireland, so we have a working group working directly with Dublin Port to understand how we can do more through the port, while dealing with its capacity issue, which is ongoing.  It does not make sense that the premier port in the country is not rail connected.  That is an issue we still have to work through.<\/p> <p>  We see the potential in offshore wind on two fronts.  We own and operate Rosslare Europort.<\/p><p>We see Rosslare Europort having serious potential to service the renewable energy, RE, industry.  We have capacity to expand there.  We are in the middle of the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea, so for access for those who will be building out the windmills there that is an opportunity for them.  Once that type of industry is established, and the south east can become a hub for that industry, by extension there will be spin-off industries to service it.  We see that having a benefit for rail and freight as a whole.  It is probably too early to quantify what it would be, but it is certainly something we are looking at.<\/p><p> On Killucan, we have met with the representatives of Killucan previously.  Indeed, the Minister met with me and some representatives of Killucan last year.  It is up to Westmeath and its development plan as to whether it sees that as an area it wants to develop.  If that is the decision in the county development plan, we would build a station.  At present, it is not on our agenda, it is not funded and it is not in the current planning profile of projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#C01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Meade","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy O'Rourke for your time management.

I am conscious that we are here not just to have a good conversation about everything Irish Rail is doing, and I will dig into that momentarily, but to discuss the all-island rail review.  I read it last night again to brief myself.  It references that it is not commuter-focused but is all about the intercity and the longer distances.  While we think Donegal is a long way away, and, relatively speaking, in our terms it is, in terms of Australia, the Continent, Russia or other places, it is only a stone's throw away.<\/p><p>I welcome the all-island aspect of the review which is not Mr. Meade's remit, as such, but he is coming here to respond to it.  I was taken by the all-island views in terms of the density and frequency of activity in some stations versus others.<\/p><p> It is not the responsibility of Mr. Meade, but I would love to see that in a 3D format to know the level of activity at stations.  It is extremely high along the east coast, much of which is caused by commuter DART and so on.  However, other stations have less than three to four services per day, such as the Waterford to Athenry and Ballybrophy lines.  It would be very difficult for those lines to pay their way but they are a valuable service in their areas and it is great they have been kept and maintained.<\/p><p> If one looks at the east coast, the speed is not great on the Waterford and Wexford lines, in particular.  I can get in my car in south Dublin and be in Wexford far faster than I ever would be on the train.  That does not even allow for getting to the train station in the first place.  What will Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann do to improve the service?  Deputy Crowe touched on the safety aspect.  The Taoiseach referenced it last night.  Public transport capacity, generally, is only approximately 60% of what it was.  Part of the reason for the fares being cut is to bring people back to using public transport.  <\/p><p>  It is not just about having a quality, safe and reliable service.  In terms of the modal shift towards decarbonisation, I have been on trains in places such as Hungary and Slovakia where one can cycle to the station and hang up one's bike in the carriage one is in, rather than worrying about it being down the other end of the train and whether there is enough room or something happening to the bike when one is not with it.<\/p><p> There are places on the Continent where one can put one's car on the train.  I would love to drive to Heuston, put my car on the train, get to Killarney and then drive around Killarney.  I like having the car at the other end.  Is there any scope for that kind of activity?  Is our country too small?  The price of fuel is going up, and pricing has been mentioned.  At the moment I can get into my car and drive to Limerick for approximately the same price as going by public transport.  It may not be the &euro;14 fare about which Deputy Crowe spoke, but the pricing can be prohibitive.  I can get to Cyprus for &euro;7.99 with Ryanair.  The air coach will not even get me to the airport for that price.<\/p><p> I know Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is bound by certain guidelines and rules.  However, is there capacity for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to offer very competitive off-peak pricing for Tuesday morning or the graveyard shift late on a Tuesday?  Clearly, rail does better with density.  It does better when the speeds of the train are faster than the car.  This may be more difficult because we are such a small country, but people want to embrace public transport where it is reliable, safe and cheap.<\/p><p> I have thrown a lot at Mr. Meade and I have not even touched on the capacity of a DART spur to the airport.  We could be waiting a while for the metro.  Is there any way we could do that, as well?  That is as much as I will throw in for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#D03200","speaker":"1696","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I hope I can cover those points.

That is where the National Transport Authority, NTA, has a big role to play.  It talks to us on an ongoing basis about how the various modes interact.  The NTA brought out the 90-minute fare this year in order that one can switch between modes of transport within the 90 minutes for the same fare.

A couple of years back, we recognised that this issue needed more attention and we recruited a security specialist who was an ex-chief superintendent.  We are bringing that skillset in-house because we did not have it.  That has worked very well.  There are regular and ongoing interactions and operations between the Garda and ourselves.  They travel on our trains quite regularly.  The drug squad travels and brings the dogs, and they actually travel undercover as well.  They have been very successful in all of those activities.<\/p> <p>  We recognise, as we said earlier, that we do have security and antisocial issues.  However, we have moved forward in conjunction with our staff.  We have a couple of forums working now where we get ideas from the staff and the Garda to make all that happen.  I will not deny that it is an ongoing uphill struggle.  However, we recognise the importance of security.  It is why we have added a lot of staff onto our trains in the past two years &ndash; the customer service operatives.  Adding staff exposes them to the potential as well, so we have many of the processes working with them.  I mentioned the Garda hubs earlier.  All those staff now have a direct phone link to the key Garda stations on the route and the Garda provide a rapid response when they gets calls from us directly.  That is working very well and we are very happy with it.  Is there more to do?  Of course there is.  With security and antisocial behaviour, we never finish.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, we have the odd breakdown.  Mechanical things will fail.  After one where we had a longer delay than we would like, we just went back to first principles and asked, &ldquo;What are we trying to achieve here?&rdquo;  When I say it, the Senator will think it is very straightforward, but the railway people keep the railway moving.  We have just shifted our emphasis so that it is not about rescuing the trains; it is about rescuing the customer and bringing the customer to the very front of our focus.

If we cannot see the full funding profile in front of us, we could at least have a pipeline of projects.

There is a cost per mile.  We have to look at it from the point of view of installing 100-year infrastructure.  When one builds rail infrastructure or any other infrastructure, one is building an asset that outlives several generations of politicians and managers.  It is national infrastructure that is there for the long haul.  The current infrastructure we are working on was built in the 1840s.  Some of it is on the same alignment and will be there for 100 more years.  We have to look at our costs over the life of the asset.  We also need to look at electrification from the point of view of where technology is taking us.  We may not need to electrify as much as we think.  We can have discontinuous electrification.  As we move towards electrification for Cork, we are considering just having charging points.  We put an order in for trains last December with a battery capacity for about 100 km.  They would travel from Mallow to Cork, Cobh and Midleton on batteries that would be charged at each station.<\/p> <p>  The technology is evolving and catenary may not be needed everywhere.  Catenary is needed for a high-frequency service that runs every five or ten minutes like the DART at peak hours.  There is a point in the level of frequency and with the size of trains where it is cheaper to have catenary doing the work.  Electrification is the way forward.  It is better at accelerating or decelerating.  It is much more efficient.  There is less maintenance involved on the units.  The new trains are all electric.  The battery pack is put on them.  If we want to take it off or add more, we can.

We expect the first report in about a month.<\/p><p>It is very much still a live issue and part of the all-island rail review.<\/p><p> I would make two points on what the Senator said about travelling from Westport and from Ballina.  We have just started, with the National Transport Authority, a review of the whole network timetable.  It is coming from the point of view of what the future will be post the pandemic and with blended working and remote working.  That timetable review is looking at the fact we are getting a new fleet.  Probably part of the reason we do not have a service everywhere at present is we have every wheel turning as it is and the higher flows of people are getting the fleet that is there.  As we start to bring in some fleet at the end of this year and then new electric trains in 18 months or two years, that will allow us cascade trains or other fleet across the country.  We intend increasing the frequency to regional cities.  We intend looking at the branch lines.  We intend looking at what the Senator mentioned - the Ballina service - and asking whether we can put another set-up there and provide an earlier morning service.<\/p><p> People will move to the regions.  We are seeing some of it already.  People will have blended working.  They will travel to Dublin a day or two a week or three days a week.  We are seeing that within our own organisation.  I believe blended working will bring more people onto public transport.  If you are driving that distance for a couple of hours, you have to drive it.  If you get on a train, you can work and do what you want.  You can eat or take a snooze if you are going home from a long day.  You cannot do any of that in the car.  That blended working will bring not only the people we had previously back onto public transport but many new people.  As we said earlier, if at the end we have the right infrastructure, be it bus connections beyond Ballina and beyond Westport, be it hopping on the Luas or on a bike here in Dublin or in Athlone, Galway or any of the intermediate stations, that is where we will get to.  The timetable review will look at more services such as the Senator outlined.

It does 600 km or 700 km and does not serve anywhere in between.  We are looking at what are probably more modest speeds compared with what the Deputy mentioned, namely nearer the 200 km per hour mark between Belfast and Dublin, and Dublin and Cork, in particular, as the main corridor.  We are targeting sub-two hour journeys on all those.  We would be targeting over the next couple of years to get the journeys to all the major cities down to under two hours.  We are currently, to Cork itself, at 2 hours 15 minutes and we would be targeting 2 hours or 1 hour 55 minutes with the business train.

I thank our guests for their presentation and their ongoing work, which is much appreciated.  The concept of the Shannon Airport spur has been around for a considerable period.  In my view, the strength of that offering will be the speed at which a train can get from Dublin to Shannon, not just to Limerick.  Our guests might outline their expectations for that service offering.  If it is just a commuter train between Limerick and Shannon, while that might help from the point of view of carbon reduction in the region, it is not going to benefit the airport and the wider economic activity in the region.  What we really need from the perspective of balanced regional development is a development that makes it easy for people to get from the east coast to the west coast, from the city with the largest population to a city such as Limerick.  There are many good plans that enhance the commuter service in the Limerick metropolitan transport initiative, which is good.  However, unless we can show high-speed access from Limerick to Shannon Airport, we are not going to gain the opportunity that we otherwise might.  Perhaps our guests will talk a little about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#J01400","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes a good point.  The question is what is the best mix.  There are a couple of pieces to that Shannon rail link.  The study will probably happen next year and Mr. Muldoon's team will probably do it for the NTA.  The question, first and foremost, is which is the best route into Shannon.  We must get that right.  The next question is about capacity.  Another of the projects we did not mention directly is the double-tracking from Limerick Junction to Limerick, which would give us capacity and line speed.  We can leave Dublin today and get direct services all the way to Ennis because we do not need to change at Limerick station.  We stay on the same train, more people get on and the train heads away again.  I fully agree with the Deputy that it is about getting all those elements right.  As we double-track out to Limerick Junction and improve that route, we are creating more capacity and speed.  I do not want to prejudge what the study will show but Cratloe would probably be the ideal location, or perhaps Sixmilebridge.  That would need to be double-tracked to create capacity.  Single tracks create restrictions and a need for passing loops.  It reduces the frequency available.  We certainly hope the spur is built because we want to operate trains and a railway.  We believe the region would benefit significantly.  It is not just about moving the people of Shannon and Limerick.  There is a much wider benefit than just the benefits to the local area.  That is going to be important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#J01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Meade"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>One of the biggest things to recognise is that Dublin Airport is reaching capacity.  I know there is an additional runway but that is not going to meet demand as we head towards 2040 and 2050.  People who understand the infrastructure of Dublin Airport know it is reaching a point beyond which it cannot go.  There is a lot of latent capacity at Shannon Airport.  There was an initiative by a previous EU Commissioner for Transport, Commissioner Violeta Bulc.  Her vision was that countries should invest in the connections between key infrastructure, such as airports, to ensure that if there is latent capacity, it is utilised, rather than building additional runways or terminals, and thereby benefiting the cities in between, in essence.  That vision may still be in the bowels of the European Commission but I think our guests are already clued into it.  I thank them for that.<\/p> <p>  I will follow on from what my colleague referred to about offshore potential.  Our guests have talked about Rosslare.  Perhaps this proposal will be way off the scale and impossible but do our guests see any opportunity for a rail link between Moneypoint and the wider rail network?  It would recognise the potential for floating offshore wind development off the west coast of Ireland, particularly in Moneypoint.  It is probably at that point most of the electricity is going to come ashore.  The ESB has plans for generating hydrogen there and other operators will want to do the same thing.<\/p><p>It may be that Moneypoint, in addition to being the landing point for electricity, has the potential to become a major hub for hydrogen.

If Irish Rail proceeds to lay the second rail track between Limerick Junction and Limerick city, how much time will it save for those going from Limerick to Dublin or from Cork to Dublin?

The service has improved significantly.  I use it and must say the staff are exceptionally good.

What is the position, what money has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann expended and what does it intend to spend on the Nenagh to Ballybrophy line?  That is a very underutilised line.  This is because the timetabling is not conducive to people travelling on the line, especially to work.  It is also very slow.  Then there is the frequency of service.  Down the years, it has always been said this service was not being used and for that reason there was not investment on it.  It was not being used because it was not attractive to the commuter.  We have put a lot of pressure on.  The representatives have been forthcoming about what they can do.  Will they outline to me what they have done and propose to do to make this line more attractive and make it easier for people to access their destination?<\/p> <p>  On the other side of that line, there is a need for a commuter service between Nenagh and Limerick.  Many people are travelling from Limerick out to Nenagh on a daily basis.  Many of them have told me they would use a service if one was available.  Nenagh is a satellite town to Limerick and with its proximity to the University of Limerick there is a big demand there.  Will the representatives tell me what proposals Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has on that?  How could they improve it and what kind of a timeframe are we talking about?<\/p> <p> How is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is catering for people with disabilities?  What improvements has it made?  Yesterday we had a debate in the D&aacute;il on people with disabilities and how difficult they are finding it to access public transport.  The representative might outline what improvements have been made there and what its plans are to enhance the service for those with a disability.<\/p> <p>  On the PSO and the overall financial position of the company, its trading has obviously been severely impacted by Covid.  Will the representative give us an overview of the company's current financial position?  What do they expect the outturn to be for the year?  What impact will the Government's decision to reduce fares have on it?  I presume there is an arrangement in place whereby the company recoups that money from the Exchequer.

We planned for four miles this year and I am happy to say the Department is looking at funding the remaining eight miles.  We are doing four miles this year then we will have eight miles left.  It has not been approved yet but the Department is looking and we believe it will look favourably at allocating the funding to finish it.

It is like going back to the Drumm battery trains of the 1930s which ran on what is now the green Luas line.  I note in the statement that the rail strategy is to support balanced regional development.  I presume that, if this is an all-Ireland strategy, this big black hole will be a big focus.  Mr. Meade might confirm if I am correct in that.  Can Mr. Meade give us some ballpark figures as to the cost of reopening a kilometre of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann-owned disused railway line as compared to building railway lines on greenfield sites or on totally new alignments?  When answering, he might give me the relative cost of doing that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Meade mentioned dramatically increased demand on lines where frequency has increased.  He also mentioned the benefits of higher frequency on the network.  Has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann modelled what might happen if the frequency were to be increased significantly on the Limerick to Galway line, the Ballybrophy to Limerick line, which Deputy Lowry mentioned, and the Waterford to Limerick line, particularly the section between Waterford and Limerick Junction because you cannot get from Waterford to Limerick without travelling that section of the line?  I am interested in that because they are three least serviced lines in the whole country.  On the last two I mentioned, I believe there is one train in each direction twice a day.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Meade said that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would do the required works at Crusheen and Ballycar if it got the funding.  I presume he is talking about dedicated funding.  That is fair enough.  Urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, funding for the passing loop in Oranmore for Ceannt Station is mentioned in the documentation.  Mr. Meade will know I know about this because it is near where I live in my constituency.  If an application was made under category 2 of the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, which provides money for planning and developing projects, to carry out the first steps, it would be 85% funded by the RRDF with a contribution from the local authorities as well.  This could allow a detailed physical survey of the western rail corridor from Athenry to Claremorris to be carried out.  In other words, we could get on the ground and find out exactly what physical work would need to be done.  All the physical surveys could be done, allowing for the design work.  What would Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's attitude be to such an approach and to funding like that coming into the process sideways so that it does not compete with its other alternative?  If you are given a ball of money, you will spend it where the people are.  <\/p> <p>  In that connection and on a second parallel issue, an undertaking was given by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, that it would fund the reinstatement of Ballyglunin bridge.  As a parallel process, could design work to reinstate that bridge, on what I believe is a slightly different alignment, not be undertaken at the same time and that project actioned?  We know where the money is going to come from in that regard because there is a written letter from TII absolutely guaranteeing that money is in the bag and should be drawn down to resolve that issue once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#M02600","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":1236,"content":"<p>I confirm that the north west is very much a part of the all-island review, as we said earlier.  On the relative costs, I will come back to the Deputy with accurate figures but you are probably looking at &euro;1.5 million or &euro;1.75 million on our own land.  After that, you are into the price of land and compulsory purchase orders so that figure could easily double if you are compulsorily purchasing virgin soil.  On category 2 RRDF funding, if we can get funding to do any of those studies, we will be more than happy to do them.  We will work through them with whatever agencies are involved.  We worked with the local authority and supported it in getting the URDF funding for Galway and Oranmore.  That was very successful and those works were fully funded.  We got a letter of intent from the NTA which said that, if we were successful in getting that funding with the local authority, it would make up the difference.  That all worked.  \"Yes\" is the short answer on that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#M02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Meade"},{"type":"speech","time":1645056000,"counter":1237,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Meade address the issue of frequency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022021700002#M02800","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645056000,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>Frequency will happen.
