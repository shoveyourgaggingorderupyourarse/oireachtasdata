It looks to me that regardless of whatever court process, resolution or victory fishermen may have through this process, the fishermen will still have the penalty points on their licence.  That is a very significant issue here.  The last day we spoke about the unfairness of the situation where a fee has not been set yet for a fisherman who wants to appeal a decision.  I tried to get the Taoiseach to intervene but he does not want to do so either.  It looks like it will be a decision for the Minister of the day as to what fee will be charged if a fishermen wants to appeal a wrongful decision being made.  It is a terrible situation to think fishermen are going to face the highest court in the land to fight their case, perhaps in a very genuine situation.  They will also find themselves in a situation where they will not know how much it will cost them to appeal the decision in the High Court.  This is totally at the discretion of the Minister who can say from &euro;5 to &euro;500,000, if he or she wants to.  That has to be resolved before anybody or any politician can support this.<\/p><p>Fishermen are exasperated.  I have spoken to them, including over the weekend, about the situation they find themselves in on many fronts.  The Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is obviously a breaking point for many of them.  It is almost a year since Brexit was agreed between Michel Barnier and Lord Frost but no work has even begun between the Government&rsquo;s civil servants and fish producer groups on this critical Common Fisheries Policy review.<\/p><p>Fishermen are angered and have a right to be.  Since the disastrous Brexit decision we are spending the bulk of our time on seeing how we can bring the Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill through the D&aacute;il.  Instead of sitting around at these committee meetings to see if we can get a better deal for the fishermen in regard to quotas, their livelihoods and overturning some of the decisions the task force seems to have agreed on in respect of the decommissioning of vessels, which is another issue in itself, we are here talking about the High Court and the wording and we not even being able to establish how much the fishermen who appeal their decisions will be asked to pay for their appeal.<\/p><p>These issues are causing so much disquiet among the fishing industry that the recent report drawn up by the task force is not being supported by the Irish South and West Fish Producer's Organisation, led by Patrick Murphy, and rightly so.  He sees the destruction of the fishing industry in this country and that there is little or no hope at present.  Unfortunately, we in the D&aacute;il are pandering to this rather than spending hours fighting to get extra quota for fishermen and seeing if there are any opportunities are out there?  Have we thrown in the towel?  That is what we should be focusing on instead of spending time on the final minutes of another nail in the coffin of Irish fishermen.<\/p><p>Regardless of a fisherman's innocence in respect of the Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, as I have said often enough, if they are caught, they do not even know how much they are going to be charged if they take a case?  If they take a case, are they still going to have the points added to their licence afterwards?<\/p><p>I mentioned Patrick Murphy.  With the indulgence of the Chairman, he might give me a few seconds to express my sincere sympathies to Patrick and his family on the death of his father, Danny Murphy, who had a serious accident a few days before his death.  He was another great man of the sea.  This is an upsetting enough time but I would like to express my sympathy to Patrick who has appeared before the committee on many occasions.  The passing of his father in the past couple of weeks has been sad.<\/p><p>I will certainly be pressing this amendment.  I plead with the Minister to consider our amendments.  It looks like no amendments I, Deputy Mac Lochlainn and others will put forward will be agreed to.<\/p><p>Nobody was listening to us either 12 months ago, and we saw the disaster that led to with the shocking deal for Irish fishermen.  It now looks like the only deal on the table is decommissioning, after a task force was set up to look at the future of Irish fishing.  If that is the future for Irish fishing then the industry is damned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#A00800","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>When the Minister was the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture and food, his colleague, the then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, was the spokesperson on the marine.  As the Minister knows well, he had serious problems with the penalty points system that was being introduced in a statutory instrument by the then Minister, Deputy Creed.  He worked with the industry to try to find a formula that would be reasonable and fair.  The industry is not opposed to penalty points being introduced.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, spoke in the D&aacute;il in the annulment debate where the then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, put forward the annulment motion and he supported it.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, now Taoiseach, and other colleagues of his supported it.  For the first time in the history of the State a statutory instrument was annulled.  That was the right course of action considering that the Supreme Court and the judicial system had found what was put forward previously as repugnant to people's rights and our laws.  That was the stance the Minister took at that time and it was the right one.<\/p> <p>  The then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, worked with the industry and put forward changes that would be fair and balanced, but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in its wisdom, continued on that path again.  This time, the Taoiseach, who was the acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, introduced pretty much the same penalty points system as Fianna F&aacute;il had voted down in opposition and now we have this legislation which is in the same spirit.  The fundamental issues are that any person in this country should have a right to be presumed innocent and not be charged with an offence unless it is beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is the threshold that is there in law to protect citizens, but what we have stated here is the \"balance of probabilities\", and the problem with that phrase is that it captures the cultural attitude of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other people who work for the State towards fishermen.  They are presumed to be committing offences and if, on the balance of probabilities, we can find them guilty, we will convict them.  It is a shocking state of affairs.  I do not believe we would accept citizens being treated like that anywhere else in Europe, in particular people who have to risk their life to earn a living.  Fundamental anger is caused by this legislation.<\/p> <p>  If a case is taken to a court of law and an appeal is made and the person is successful, the points still remain in place.  I have given the Minister an analogy previously.  If any citizen is charged with a speeding offence and issued with provisional points subject to appeal and the appeal is successful, yet the points remained on the licence, could the Minister imagine the outrage, but that is how we want to deal with fishermen?  What my amendment speaks to is the barrier to their right to appeal.  The Minister cannot be immune to the anger in the fishing community.  He has done online town hall meetings and a physical tour of harbours.  He is meeting with fishermen on an ongoing basis.  He knows how they feel and the anger at the weighing system on piers and harbours, which again was the outworking of a cultural attitude to fishermen that they are criminals.  Now we have this arbitrary system in place, which I hope will be reversed very soon.  We have a culture in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority which I hope to God changes very soon.  One has to work with any industry.  I accept there must be regulation and a penalty points system, but they must be fair and balanced, as all laws have to be.  That is what we are getting wrong here.<\/p> <p>  I do not think the Minister is going to accept any Opposition amendments and that he is going to ram the Bill through Committee Stage today, he will ram it through on Report Stage and proceed on the path he is on.  I ask him to take on board what I say to him today.  He should know from all the meetings he is having that there is a real sense from the inshore fleet, the offshore fleet, the approximately 2,000 boats we have in the fleet around the island, that they are being criminalised.  They are being viewed as criminals.  They feel constant anxiety about what they are doing.  That is wrong.  This legislation gets the balance terribly wrong.  The Minister knows that in his heart.  He took the right decision at the time with the then Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher.  This is the wrong approach now.<\/p> <p>  That is the commentary I want to put to the Minister today.  I appeal to him to change direction.  If he does not do so today, I appeal to him to reflect on the debate today and to change direction.  Many good people in the fishing industry are speaking to him and telling him this.  He should listen more to them and less to the departmental officials who are advising him.  That is the best favour I can do him, to advise him to listen more to fishermen around the coast about their real-life experience and less to the departmental officials who advise him, because to be frank about it, they are completely out of touch with fishing communities.  I have discussed the amendment.  I will not take the opportunity again to talk about the wider problems with the Bill and will focus on dealing with each amendment in turn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#B00200","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I will speak to the technical details relating to the two amendments.  To accede to Deputy Collins's amendment No. 16 and to confer on the Minister the role of final arbiter in the context of the masters' points system would be to risk politicising decision-making in a manner that is in my opinion contrary to good practice.<\/p> <p>  The determination panel and appeals officer have both been established to deal with serious infringements which attract points.  The Bill allows for a master to apply to the High Court regarding a decision of the appeals officer on a point of law only, which the Minister of the day is in no position to determine.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister, as opposed to the High Court, to determine a matter after the independent determination panel and appeals officer have already adjudicated on it.   This would take the independent evaluation and decision-making back into a political realm and is completely contrary to best practice of having serious infringements determined on an objective and impartial basis overseen from a legal perspective by the courts.  I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment for these reasons.<\/p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 17 proposed by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, in the context of the licence holder's points system, as provided for under SI 318\/2020, it was suggested by the industry that the licence holder should have a right to a full rehearing of the case before the High Court.  The legal position is clear that under the Constitution, the High Court has \"full original jurisdiction\" and can hear all matters of law brought before it.  The legal position is that it would be highly anomalous, if not unprecedented, to provide such a full High Court rehearing of a matter first governed by the procedures which were set down in the 2020 statutory instrument.  In addition, it would delay the application of points, which would run up against the timeline set down in the EU regulation that points apply for three years with a commencement date of the date of detection.  To that extent, it would hinder the effective implementation of this EU law and would not meet Ireland's obligations to implement these provisions.  The High Court retains a supervisory and review capacity, which provides for an appeal on a point of law to the High Court, which is entirely in keeping with statutory review and appeal procedures of this nature.  Accordingly, the legal position is that while the High Court retains the constitutional authority to enjoy full original jurisdiction over any legal proceedings, this authority has been circumscribed by the specific appeals mechanisms set down in primary and secondary legislation, which overwhelmingly limit just High Court appeals to reviews on a point of law.  I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment for those reasons.<\/p><p> To take it in the round, particularly given the points made by the Deputy, as he knows, the introduction of these statutory instruments has been subject to a comprehensive process, including rigorous assessment in the D&aacute;il.  As he also said, there was the annulling of the previous statutory instrument and the subsequent tabling amendments for consideration coming out of that.  All of those amendments were considered in great detail to see if it was possible for them to be accommodated into the statutory instrument while introducing a statutory instrument that would have us compliant with our obligations as a control authority under the CFP.  Any amendments that could be accepted and accommodated were accommodated.  Any that were not accommodated were not accommodated because they would have undermined and made the regulations that are being brought into place non-compliant with our obligations.<\/p><p> We are the very final member of the common fisheries control area to introduce a penalty points system for licence holders and masters.  It is not that we are the best boys in class.  We are the last boys to deal with our obligations in this regard to the extent that enforcement proceedings have been commenced against us by the European Commission for not living up to our obligations under the CFP to have a penalty points system in place, and that our funding European funding has been suspended because we have not dealt with this issue.<\/p><p> The Deputy&rsquo;s party in opposition followed very much the lead of Fianna F&aacute;il at that time and again followed the lead in the various amendments that were proposed.  Those have all been considered in great detail, with some accepted, and those that have not been accepted were not accepted for very good reason.  It comes to a stage where decisions have to be made and things have to happen.  That is something that is a responsibility of being in government.  As the Deputy outlined in his contribution, it follows a comprehensive process, which was much too lengthy really, because it has left us in a position where this has gone on far too long, where we are not compliant and where funding has been suspended, and that must be addressed.  We must put in place a fair and equitable penalty points system that meets our obligations as a control authority.  That is the approach that was taken.  That is the reason the Taoiseach signed the statutory instrument, namely, to reflect the need for a penalty points system for licence holders, and that is why I am now bringing forward the legislation in regard to masters.<\/p><p> It has been extensively considered and teased out, and we are now at the endgame of having to introduce appropriate legislation that does the job.  It is open to the Deputy to propose that he would do otherwise.  It is open to him to give commitments that he would do something else were he in government.  We rarely hear him say that.  He criticises many things but never, ever lays his cards on the table as to what he would do and never makes commitments that might bind him.  It is open to him today to make a binding commitment as to what it is he would do if he had the opportunity in the future, and then to hold himself to that.  It is much harder to do that and to step up to the mark in terms of being responsible, than it is to simply oppose.<\/p><p> All of this has been given very significant and detailed consideration.  This is appropriate.  It is something I am bringing forward as Minister.  It is not appropriate or fair to be blaming anyone else for it or to blame the officials.  Again, it is an oft-used mechanism of opposition to blame someone else.  Every decision that comes forward from me as Minister is something that has been vetted, considered and put forward by me.  That is my responsibility and duty as Minister.  Again, as the Deputy outlined, this follows a comprehensive approach taken in regard to where we have got to today.  Each of the amendments that has been tabled has been comprehensively considered and the answers today will reflect all of that consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#B00300","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

When there was this hiatus between ministerial appointments and the Taoiseach signed this statutory instrument at, I assume, the request of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s senior officials, there was correspondence from the four major producer organisations in the State at that time, outlining their profound concerns about what had happened and that there needed to be changes.  Nothing was done about those profound concerns.

The first stage is to put forward an appeal.  The Minister wondered whether it was going to be the &euro;25 that the Rural Independent Group put forward in our submission.  He did not have his mind made up at all before he came into the meeting as to what was going to happen.  At the end of the day, if a fisherman is going to go to the High Court, he needs to know he can afford to go to there.  If the Minister cannot, even at this stage, look at that type of an amendment and come in here beforehand to say he is accepting it or not, and that it is going to be &euro;100,000, &euro;10,000, &euro;5,000 or &euro;5, he has not comprehensively considered these amendments at all; rather, he has chucked them in the bin before he came in here.<\/p> <p>  I am astonished and many fishermen who have listened to this and their organisations are astonished.  We need change.  We need to go back to Europe.  There need to be laws but there need to be laws that are agreed to initially by the fishing industry in this country.  The Minister said we are the last boys in the class.  Let us be honest.  We were the first boys or the whipping boys in the class in the Brexit negotiations, and we got a fair whipping, of that there is no doubt.  Now, we need to be the last boys in the class.  We certainly do not need to comply with and pander to everything that Europe wants.<\/p><p>We need to be able to put in our own amendments here and our own safeguards for our fishermen who are fishing the waters.  They are in a dire situation as we speak.  The Minister has said these amendments in respect of the High Court have been comprehensively considered but I am in complete disagreement with that because I can see the way these amendments are just being thrown out one by one.  Regardless of what changes we ask for, the Minister is totally opposed to them.  I will definitely press these amendments because they are hugely important.  Changes need to be made to this before we take the legislation any further.  It is the first piece of work that has been done on fishing since the dreadful Brexit negotiations.  This is another dreadful thing for fishermen.  I will certainly not be in any way, shape or form supporting this.  I will be asking to go back and to support the fisherman on this one here.  We should go back out to Europe and fight for the Irish because as far as the fishermen are concerned, the fight is being lost.

As I said earlier, it is going through massive struggles.  We have put together a very bad sea-fisheries Bill.  We are tabling amendments to see whether we can clean up what is a mess.  It looks like none of the amendments will be accepted.  If they are not accepted the writing is on the wall.  I was aghast to see Deputies from the Government voting in favour of earlier amendments.  They were very much not rural Deputies.  I know it is a holiday time but certainly they did not know what they were voting for.  I heard one of them state he did not know much about agriculture.  This is about fishing and the marine.  It is a bad reflection on the Government that this is the attitude out there.  Marine has been the poor relation for many decades.  The proof of the pudding is the dreadful deal on Brexit that was agreed running into Christmas.<\/p><p>The balance of probability has come up here so many times.  Fishermen have said to me that it looks like the Bill will condemn fishermen because no matter whether they are innocent or guilty they will end up with penalties on their licence or on the licence of the skipper.  That is a very serious worry.  I am not at all in agreement with this Bill.  It could be renegotiated and we could get a better deal for Irish fishermen certainly after the raw deals we have got continually down through the years.  My amendment focuses on the need to change what has been agreed at government level with, I presume, Europe holding a stick over our heads once again in the fishing industry.  As much as &euro;400 million plus in blood money is earmarked to be spent across the fishing communities on projects ranging from pier upgrades to processing grants to aquaculture tie-up schemes.  All of the funding is to be taken from the &euro;1 billion EU slush fund out of the &euro;5 billion in total that has been set aside by the EU.  This paltry sum is designed to shut up the fishing industry as compensation for the theft of future billions of euro from Irish fishing communities and from the Irish people.<\/p><p> My amendment and the other amendments that I have put forward are meant to, in some way,  lift the burden from fishermen.  The offshore fleet has now been reduced to just over 100 boats so the waters are being cleared of Irish fishing vessels forever in preparation for the hundreds of foreign vessels that will replace them and fish away happily while plundering 85% or more of the pie.  This continues to leave our coastal fishing communities with just under 15% of all of the fish and it is patently clear that 15% is not enough for fishermen to survive.  It looks like this Bill will be foisted upon us so it will lead to further devastation and I will press my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#F00100","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I have just read back over the comments made by the Minister before he took up the post of Minister.  At that time he was very critical of the Department and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  The big issue for him then was the balance of probability.  The current approach in the statutory instrument deals with the balance of probability rather than having to prove beyond doubt, which is normally the case where a criminal sanction is being pursued.  At that point he was very much on the same page on which I am now and he clearly understood that this is a serious issue.<\/p> <p>  The amendment is a good one in that if a person has been successful in his or her appeal then penalty points should not be assigned.  I would love to get a comparison.  I have seen a document, which I  referred to during committee meetings on pre-legislative scrutiny, that compared the implementation of penalty points across the European Union.  Again, I put it to the Minister that I am not aware, but I could be wrong and I am happy to be proven wrong, of anywhere in the European Union where there is the potential for a person to lose their livelihood with a threshold of the balance of probabilities.  Indeed - and the Minister has talked about the fact that administrative law and criminal law run parallel with each other - one can take action if one feels it is serious enough in the criminal law system.  If a person wins his or her appeal then that would not lead to his or her points being removed.<\/p> <p>  This is a good amendment and I ask the Minister to return to the spirit that he demonstrated a couple of years ago on this issue.  At that time he was entirely right in his assessment and criticised the Department in the approach that it had taken at that time, and he said that its approach was a bad reflection on the Department.  I ask that the Minister accepts the amendment as it refers to natural justice in terms of the penalty points.  The Minister asked about the policy of Sinn F&eacute;in.  These points concern natural justice and should not be the subject of debate but, unfortunately, in this country fishermen are seen to be fair game, which is a situation that has been allowed to go on for too long. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#G00200","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>This is another one of the amendments on which I did not speak earlier as is the other amendment tabled by Deputy Collins.

The earlier amendment set a target of just &euro;25 for the cost of lodging an appeal.

All we want is for fishermen and fisherwomen to be treated fairly and in the exact same way as any other citizen in this country.  I mean if I win my appeal in the High Court against fines imposed against me then the penalty points would be struck off but in this stance we are talking about points being left on a licence for three years.

Every amendment from Sinn F&eacute;in and the Rural Independent Group, which I represent, has been ruled out of order.  We find ourselves in a very unfair situation.  As I said earlier, this amendment provides for further discussion.  We are in a dire situation after a shocking Brexit deal that has inflicted the most horrendous cuts on the fishing industry.  To be honest, the industry is still mesmerised and shocked at the astonishing way we threw away our quota and pegged it out to the foreign fleets of the world.  It looked like, and I always said it in the D&aacute;il, Michel Barnier was doing a deal for France.  He truly proved that.  We should have had stronger engagement, and I pleaded for that to the previous Government many months before this Government took office.  Brexit was coming towards us and all the signs were negative with regard to what the Irish fishing industry was going to lose.  Up to the dying minutes I pleaded with the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, to make sure that he forced an intervention, but we see the consequences of a poor judgment and a poor call.  Obviously, I congratulate Michel Barnier for cutting a deal for the French, but it is much to the demise of the Irish fishing industry.<\/p><p>As regards this amendment, we have to force discussion in the D&aacute;il and at committee level about the Brexit cuts and the quota for Irish fishermen into the future.  I read out some of the statements earlier and I do not wish to keep going back over what I said, but this Bill is a bad deal for Irish fishermen.  It is supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Fianna F&aacute;il was seemingly opposed to almost the same deal a few years ago, but has changed its mind now while in government and is railroading ahead with it regardless of what amendments we put forward.  Surely to God some of these amendments could have been better examined.  The Minister said earlier that there was comprehensive consideration of our amendments in detail but he continued to throw out each amendment brought before the House.  The very least we should get out of this is full debate in the future about the fishing industry in Ireland.  It is at the verge of collapse.  The best deal coming from the task force is decommissioning, which is shocking to say the least.  It is going to deplete the fishing industry further in Ireland.  All we seem to be doing is making way for foreign fleets to come to Ireland and take our fish out of our seas.  That is what it comes to.  That is the way it has been for the last number of decades.  Nothing has changed and things have got worse.<\/p><p>We are in the dying minutes of discussing these amendments.  I am very disappointed that the Government did not see fit to support any of our amendments even though they were meant to work with this difficult Bill.  All I can say is that we would have full debate in the D&aacute;il, as is provided for in this amendment, prior to this legislation coming into operation.  There are Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies from coastal communities who have not been seen here to answer for themselves.  They should be here and hold themselves accountable because they will have to knock on the doors of their constituents.  If they have failed, and the fishermen are telling me that they are failing, they will be run from the doors.  That is the bottom line here.  Many of these fishermen are now unemployed; many of them have lost their income.  Many of them are going to lose their boats, their future and their livelihoods.  That is what they know.  That is how they grew up and educated themselves.  They have been let down repeatedly by continuous governments, and this Bill is the death knell.  Decommissioning and everything else is being laid out on a pathway of destruction for the Irish fishing industry.<\/p><p>All I can say, and I am providing for this in the amendment, is that if we do not give more time to debate this prior to this legislation coming into operation, it will be a further infliction on the fishermen.  We might have a stay or reprieve in respect of this sea fisheries Bill.  We might be able to go back to Europe and forge a better deal for the fishing community.  It is time for Europe to understand that we will no longer be its whipping boy, which is what we have been.  I have spoken to the fishermen in Castletownbere, Union Hall, Glandore and throughout west Cork over the last number of years and particularly over the last six or 12 months.  In spite of visits from heads of state, nothing has happened.  They have seen not one improvement.  How can members of Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael come here and continue to pound hardship on these people and have no solution?  All I am seeking is a solution.  Is anything going to happen to the bluefin tuna quota or will we have to talk about it for the next ten years?  Is there a general acceptance that Europe can get any quota it wants, but Ireland cannot get the quota?  What is wrong?  Where is the weakness here?  Do we need changes in the Department from the top to the bottom?  Do we need to look at the SFPA?  Where are the supports for the fishermen?  They have not been there to date, and the fishermen feel it and understand it.  They are losing their income.<\/p><p>Fishermen and fisherwomen were born, bred and reared to work their hands and work in the sea, and they have been terribly let down.  It is our richest resource and we seem to be damned to destroy the fishing industry.  We are attacking agriculture as best we can too, but today we are discussing fishing.  It surrounds me in my constituency.  I have inshore boats and pelagic fishermen.  They are losing their income and they are asking me what is there for them.  Decommissioning is not a way out.  That is only getting rid of the problem so that maybe we can lick up to the Europeans and tell them we have done our best to let them come in and take a bigger slice of the cake.  We must have further debate on this issue.  We need the Taoiseach to get personally involved on this.  This is what I am seeking in this amendment.  A full debate prior to the legislation coming into operation must take place.  It must be a detailed, not rushed, discussion on where we intend to take the fishing industry of this country and where its future lies.<\/p><p>Since Brexit was implemented last year, fishermen are saying no hour of work has begun between the Government, civil servants or the fish producer groups on the critical Common Fisheries Policy that is to come.  In all that 12 months, no hour of work has begun on looking at the future.  We are continuously locked into what we want to give away and what further difficulties we want to foist on our fishermen.  Deputies come in here and are quite happy to support all this.  Do they see the future?  Do they see any future in the fishing industry?  Is that gone and is it time to hit the agriculture industry?  That is where we are going.  When I knock on the doors I talk to people, and I continue to meet and talk to people.  The fishing industry is on its knees and it is pleading with the Government, regardless of what is the Government of the day, to make sure it tries to turn this around.  There is nothing in this Bill or in anything I see that will turn this around, other than decommissioning, decommissioning, decommissioning.  That is what the task force has come up with.  I am proud of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation for rejecting that task force report.  It was 100% correct.  Decommissioning is not the way forward.  We have enough seas.<\/p><p>We have enough fish in Irish waters to keep thousands of people employed.  Instead, we are wiped out.  We need to debate that and that is what this amendment is about.  It is about further debate.  Some Deputies that come in to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann know what fishing is about.  I certainly have a lot to learn.  I am not a fisherman but come from the agricultural sector.  In my time in the D&aacute;il, regardless of what parties are in power, there has been little or no debate on or understanding of how we can turn things around for the Irish fishermen and fisherwomen that local rural communities are totally dependent on.  We can decommission them, strike them off and make them unemployed, which is what the Government is going to do.  What is going on here in this House will never be forgotten.  I plead with my colleagues to accept this amendment and fully debate every detail of what is going on in the fishing industry, including the Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the task force, the decommissioning and the quotas.  We hear so much about quotas but we are getting little or no quota.  All we are getting is wiped out through less quotas and fishermen are asking why.  What is wrong with the political system in this country that we cannot understand the richness of the resource that we have, our seas?  Is it the Department that is wrong?  Does it need changing from top to bottom?  What is wrong?  Why is there not a focus on this?  Why, when we are out in Europe negotiating, do we throw fishing to the wind and let it float its own boat?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#K00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>We are dealing with section 15.

Section 15 simply lays out the Long Title to the Bill.  All legislation should have some review procedure within it and some method of reporting on its operation over time.  That is vitally important and particularly so regarding the fishing industry.  We need to debate it because it is going through a very difficult time at the moment.  As Deputy Collins has said, in a couple of years' time we may not be having a debate at all because there will be nothing to talk about.  The Government's attitude to the fishing industry and its position on it is made clear by the &euro;66 million decommissioning scheme which will get rid of one third of the whitefish fleet.  From this point on, the fleet will only be two thirds of its current size and next year we may be talking about another decommissioning scheme.  That seems to be the height of the Government's response to, and focus on, the fishing industry which is sad and wrong.  It is doing a disservice to fishing communities right across the country.  The fishing industry has potential but only if the Government fights for it at European level to try to ensure that EU policies respond to our needs.  It is sad to say that, as Deputy Collins outlined, Mr. Michel Barnier seems to have fought hard on behalf of the French fishing industry but let Ireland down.  He was supposed to be negotiating on behalf of the entire EU.  For that reason, I am taking this opportunity to speak to this amendment.  It might not be in the right place but it should be accommodated in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#L00400","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I agree that the amendment should be accommodated.  As I said earlier, this Bill cannot be taken in isolation.  The reaction of fishing communities to this Bill reflects their anger at the long-standing culture of not helping them to build their industry but of holding them back.  The approach that is taken in this legislation and by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, reflects a culture that is not replicated across Europe.  I do not believe there is the same level of enforcement and monitoring of other fishing fleets as we see with our own fleet by our own authorities.  Regulators and law enforcers have a job to do but there is a way of doing it which involves respecting the people they are working with, including them in what they are doing and agreeing an approach.  This is about the management of a precious resource.  Anybody with a brain knows that over-fishing is a damned stupid thing to do.  The resource has to be managed, nurtured and replenished but people are intelligent enough to see that under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, we have super trawlers around our coast hoovering up fish while the authorities are chasing inshore fishermen and challenging them on their practices.  Fishermen are looking out at cities of lights.  Famously, in the documentary \"Atlantic\", a fisherman refers to a super trawler as a \"city out there\".  These boats are 140 m. long; they are massive and are hoovering up fish while we talk about sustainability and enforcement.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister knows, our fishing communities are really intelligent.  Fishing is in their genes and is intergenerational.  These communities know that what they are being asked to do makes no sense when one looks at the bigger picture.  I understand there will be a debate in the D&aacute;il in the coming weeks on the seafood task force report and our approach to the CFP.  The Minister and the Government will be challenged to at least call out what is happening in terms of super trawlers and the fact that we get 15% of the fish under the CFP.  Under the quota system, we get 15% in our 200 mile exclusive economic zone.  Indeed, in a number of species, it is even more derisory than that.  We have a situation where we are going to decommission, potentially, another 60 boats of over 15 m. to 18 m., which means that the fleet will be dramatically reduced from 2006 levels.  This dramatic reduction is happening at a time when other European countries are investing in their fishing fleets.  Belgium, for example, stands out in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  We will get a chance soon to debate this at length in the D&aacute;il and all of us will contribute to that debate but the seafood task force report, from the perspective of our fishing industry, our catchers, is a white flag of surrender.  It demonstrates an unwillingness to confront the injustice that is happening.  We have the richest fishing grounds in all of Europe.  We are the only island nation in the EU right now.  We have a massive resource staring at us.  There are lots of Deputies on the Government side from coastal communities and I know they agree with me on this.  We have an immense resource but we are giving it away.  What we are doing goes against the principles of the European Union.  If we were to speak about what is happening in Ireland, not with the political decision makers or some of the huge corporations in the industry but with the average French, Belgian, Spanish or Dutch person, they would not agree with it.  I do not believe this is what they stand for but this is what is happening.  <\/p> <p>  All our fishermen can see is more and more barriers and difficulties and they are being driven out of the industry.  That is why a number of fishermen will probably avail of decommissioning because they do not see any future for themselves.  They do not see any future, which is terrible.  If one looks at the size of our fleet in 2006 in comparison with what it will be if fishermen avail of decommissioning, it is a terrible indictment of our country.  That is why this legislation cannot be taken in isolation and why Deputy Collins is right to ask that it be seen in the wider context.  We are asking for a change of direction from the Government.  We may not win the battle today but we will continue this dialogue with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>Like me, he represents a coastal community.  In his heart, he knows that the points we are making are correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#L00500","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to say a few words about what is happening today regarding this and other amendments.  All the committee's amendments are being ruled out of order and are not being entertained.  That is very sad and very bad.<\/p> <p>  It is on record that it was the UK that first taught coastal communities how to fish back in the 1600s.  Since then, Irish fishermen have developed, modernised and kept coastal communities going through the years, decades and centuries.  Fishing has provided a living, sometimes part time and more often full time, all along our coasts.  All we can seem to offer fishermen now is to decommission them.  The Government is saying it can pay fishermen to cease and give up, but who will replace their income and employment in coastal communities?  This will have a devastating effect, for evermore, on those communities that depend so much on fishing for their livelihoods, whether it is the small shop, chemist, bed and breakfast or whatever, which all benefit in some small way.  <\/p> <p>  We are closing down one of the only things we have.  It is the same as closing down Bord na M&oacute;na.  This Government is closing down all the things we have and are good at; that will be its record.  The sad thing about it is that it is not just Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il individually but both of them together.  This is what is happening.  Every day we see that the only racket about fishing now is between the French and the UK.  That is where the fight is because they have something to fight about.  We have nothing to fight about except for the Government turning on our people and our own flesh and blood, who are trying to operate, do their jobs, earn a living and employ people.  All we do and all we offer is to decommission them.  We then further penalise them with penalty points.<\/p> <p>  I very much appreciate, from the bottom of my heart, what Pat The Cope Gallagher tried to do.  He was of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, but he got us to rescind the penalty points only a few months ago.  He left the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's chair, went to the back benches and put forward a Bill, which we all voted for, including Fianna F&aacute;il members who are voting for this penalty points system now.  They all voted to rescind that statutory instrument and now we are bringing it forward again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#M00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>The Deputy has to speak to section 15, which we are dealing with now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#M00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I will finish.

I am very sad we are going down the road of hurting them more with penalty points.  There will be a weighing system whereby Irish fishermen have to weigh their catches on the port or pier they come in to while foreign fishermen can load up their lorries and go home.

This technical Supplementary Estimate is required to make use of savings on the Department&rsquo;s Vote to provide for spend over several headings.  To allow a technical Supplementary Estimate to take place, a token &euro;1,000 will be added on to my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  No additional funding is being requested.<\/p><p>I propose moving &euro;49.8 million in savings across other subheads.  As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve changes to the original 2021 voted allocations, I believe that it is important to seek the members' input and approval.<\/p><p>The areas where savings have emerged reflect the dynamic and uncertain environment in which the sector and the Department have operated in this year.  Despite the continuing challenges of the pandemic and Brexit, we have continued to carry out our business as usual.  Since September 2021, more than &euro;960 million has been paid to farmers in respect of this year's basic payment and areas facing natural constraints, ANC, schemes.  The Department issues these advance payments at a rate of 70% and 85%, respectively, to farmers at the earliest date possible under EU regulations.  The remaining balancing payments at a rate of 30% and 15%, respectively, are due to commence in early December.  Payments under the sheep welfare scheme, the protein aid scheme and the straw incorporation measure are also due to commence in the coming weeks with the sheep welfare scheme due this week.  Targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, payments are ongoing, with some &euro;56 million paid to date this year.<\/p><p>I will outline where the savings, which we propose to use, have emerged, starting with the information management technology saving of &euro;5 million.  In December last year, the Department issued two new procurement competitions for the upgrade of the Department's core systems and the development of systems to cater for the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, post 2022. <\/p><p>The incumbent company for the existing contracts was not successful in either of the two new procurement processes and initiated High Court proceedings in the matter.  This resulted in the Department not being able to source the additional resources identified for a significant lead-in period, circa five months in total, until the High Court proceedings were resolved as a result of the company withdrawing the proceedings.  This delay resulted in the Department being unable to progress system development as planned, which also had the effect of resources from other contracts not being taken on in both the number and at the time originally envisaged. <\/p><p>Savings of &euro;3 million in travel and incidental expenses have also been identified due to the reduction of the volume of travel undertaken by my Department during recent months understandably as a result of the pandemic.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Under the subhead B3 agri-environmental schemes, total current savings of &euro;21.35 million are being redistributed.  The savings set out below are offset by an increase in the subhead's capital allocation by &euro;2.5 million.  Some &euro;1.55 million of these savings arise from the organic scheme and &euro;22.3 million are from schemes due to be funded by the EU&rsquo;s recovery instrument funding, EURI.  Some &euro;56 million of EURI designated funding was provided in 2021 to cover a suite of new agri-environmental schemes, including a new organics scheme, a straw incorporation measure, new European innovation partnerships, EIPs, and for an environmental tranche of TAMs.  Funding for EURI schemes is provided by the Exchequer in the first instance, then reclaimed at a rate of 100% from the EU.  Commencement of these schemes was delayed until an amendment to the rural development programme could be fully approved by the European Commission, which did not happen until mid-year.  EURI funding is subject to what is known as the N+3 rule, which means it can be spent in the three years from the date of programming.<\/p><p>I assure the committee that the EURI funding will spent over the coming years and that the money available to farmers has not been lost.  The Exchequer funding attributed to these EURI schemes as part of the Vote will thus be utilised under other subheads.<\/p><p> In the areas of natural constraint, subhead B4, there are savings of &euro;1 million due to of the level of eligible claims received.<\/p><p> Under capital expenditure, my Department continues to operate the large on-farm investment scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II.  TAMS is made up of a suite of seven measures and was launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 with a budget of &euro;395 million over the full period of the rural development programme.  Payments under the TAMS II scheme continue to issue on an ongoing basis.  To date in 2021 we have issued payments of &euro;56 million.  However, there have been some impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on investment works, particularly building works, during the restrictions.  As a result, I am utilising a saving of &euro;3.3 million from the 2021 allocation to fund expenditure elsewhere.<\/p><p> My Department has actively encouraged all approved applicants under the scheme to submit payment claims including by contacting approved applicants individually by text message on a number of occasions and reminding approved participants to submit their payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so.  However, as TAMS II is a demand-led scheme, the timing of the completion of works and submission of payment claims within the timeframe set out in their approval letter are matters for the farmers themselves.  In general, participants have 12 months from the date of approval to complete works and submit a payment claim with a shorter timeframe of six months for the equipment involved.<\/p><p> Also on the capital side, we are seeking to move &euro;7 million in capital expenditure from the forestry allocation.  This saving has arisen because new planting has been much less than anticipated at the beginning of the year.  I am aware that the current licensing delays are a contributory factor to the reduced levels of planting.  We are addressing the current delays in a robust way with additional resources, a dedicated project plan and a reformed appeals system.  We are also looking at ways to re-engage farmers so that they see forestry not as a displacement activity but as complementary to their farming enterprise.<\/p><p> In the subhead B12, market volatility, a capital saving of &euro;300,000 has been identified.  Subhead C11, other services, has savings of &euro;2 million coming from a number of areas including savings on legal expenses.<\/p><p> Projected savings of &euro;4.9 million are available in the fisheries subhead.  Fisheries expenditure will be monitored on an ongoing basis over the remaining six weeks of the year to ensure spend is maximised in 2021.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority subhead has savings of &euro;2 million as a result of Covid-19 pandemic impacts on recruitment and travel.<\/p><p> Regarding how the reallocated funding will be used, utilising savings from TAMS and forestry this year will ultimately free up funding for 2022 as we prepay some commitments relating to next year now.  This will leave us better able to take on the many challenges that face the industry next year.  Some &euro;7.3 million of the capital savings described will allow my Department to provide access to finance.  Finance is a crucial business need and, as well as liaising with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector, we work closely across Government to provide important supports for businesses, including farmers, fishers and food businesses.  Most recently this has been to ensure that they have access to finance during the pandemic and also to help deal with the challenges brought about by Brexit.  These supports have been delivered with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<\/p><p> My Department co-funds the future growth loan scheme with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It supports strategic long-term capital investment by small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers and fishermen.  It has been in high demand and 1,595 loans or 46% were drawn down by the agrifood sector, with a value of &euro;235.8 million or 32% of the overall pot.  The transfer of &euro;7.3 million in my Department&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate will facilitate an advance payment for my Department&rsquo;s contribution under the scheme for 2022.  The Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme provides an important source of working capital finance.  The 2021 allocation of &euro;800,000 has been converted to capital funding to align how this scheme is accounted for by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p><p> We recently launched the Brexit impact loan scheme, which is a medium-term, lower-cost scheme to fund working capital and investments for businesses, including primary producers and food businesses, impacted by Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.  The scheme opened for applications on 14 October. The remaining capital funding of &euro;2.5 million has been allocated to the soil sampling scheme to cover 2021.  The soil sampling programme will provide information to farmers on their soil fertility and also soil pathogen assessment.  The programme will measure baseline soil carbon levels which will guide future actions to support carbon farming.  It will also provide the basis for the next generation of soil-specific nutrient management advice and underpin targeted fertiliser and organic manure applications, ensuring the right nutrient type, right application rate, right time and right place across all farming systems.<\/p><p> Some &euro;11 million of the reallocated funding will go to a Brexit temporary fleet tie-up scheme.  The scheme will help mitigate the impacts of quota cuts on the fishing fleet arising from the trade and co-operation agreement agreed between the European Union and the UK.  The scheme delivers on a recommendation of the seafood sector task force and is targeted at white fish vessels in the polyvalent and beam trawl segments.  The scheme will be managed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and under it, vessels would tie up at the quayside and cease all fishing activity for that month.  In return, the vessel owners would receive a payment compensating for the lost fishing income during that month.  The vessel owners will in turn be required to distribute one third of that payment to crew.<\/p><p> The Marine Institute is seeking a once-off allocation in 2021 of &euro;5 million to enable costs related to the data collection framework, DCF, which is funded on an annual basis by this Department under subhead D, to be met on a current-year-payment basis with effect from 1 Jan 2022.<\/p><p> Due to the timing of approval of the 2014 to 2020 DCF programme and funding, a position developed whereby the Marine Institute receives funding for a particular year&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund-funded DCF expenditure one year after the spend is incurred.  Therefore, funding is received one year in arrears.  As it currently stands, the 2021 Estimate includes &euro;5 million for the 2020 costs, and the 2021 costs would be paid in 2022.  If the proposal is approved and the savings are available, the 2020 and 2021 costs could be paid in 2021, with the 2022 costs paid from the 2022 allocation.<\/p><p> The sheep welfare subhead B.8 will be increased by &euro;1.5 million under today's submission.  The reference period, which determines the maximum number of animals paid under scheme, was recently changed from 2014-15 to 2017.  This change is also in line with existing commitments set out in the programme for Government, which includes the commitment to build on schemes such as the sheep welfare scheme in a way that enhances farm incomes and animal welfare objectives, recognising their significant contribution to net farm incomes.  This commitment reflects that sheep farming contributes to both economic and environmental sustainability, in particular on more marginal land, with sheep grazing being an important land management tool in parts of the country where land usage options are relatively limited.  Given that this change requires additional funding of &euro;1.5 million for 2021 above the allocation agreed in this Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2021, I am increasing the allocation from &euro;17 million to &euro;18.5 million.<\/p><p> The United Nations World Food Programme is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian organisation, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.  The World Food Programme assists 115 million people in 84 countries through food or cash distributions in emergencies and nutrition support programmes.<\/p><p>The World Food Programme was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its efforts to fight hunger and its contribution to enabling conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas.  It relies entirely on voluntary funding, with governments being its principal donors.  Ireland has long been a supporter of the World Food Programme and my Department is the lead Department for the relationship with it.  The aggregate value of Ireland's contribution to the World Food Programme in the 30 years from 1991 amounts to some &euro;550 million.  Ireland commits funding through three yearly strategic partnership agreements with the World Food Programme, which for the period 2019 to 2021 committed &euro;70 million.  My Department is currently finalising the strategic partnership agreement for the years 2022-2024 under which it is proposed to commit &euro;75 million.  This &euro;25 million allocation represents an advance on that commitment and it will help save lives by supporting food security and nutrition, and rebuilding livelihoods in fragile settings.  It reaffirms Ireland's role as one of World Food Programme's most engaged partners.<\/p><p> I believe this is a necessary and important Supplementary Estimate which I earnestly recommend to the committee for support.  I am happy to respond to any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#N00400","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Are we dealing with the Supplementary Estimates programme by programme or across the board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#P00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I do not mind.

For example, in a situation where a 100% penalty is applied, it would not be possible to return concrete.  Some of the cases I am dealing with are in regard to technical anomalies.  One case involves a husband and wife, returned emigrants and new farmers, whose receipts were in some cases paid to him, in others to her and to a company they both own.  They now face the prospect of losing their farm if their appeal is not successful.  Has the Minister had any interaction with his officials in regard to this area?

Where they are not adhered to, that can lead to real challenges and circumstances such as those outlined by the Deputy.  Looking not just to TAMS but across the various schemes that will be there in the next CAP strategic plan, it is really important we ensure there is proportionality regarding checks and balances and that any penalties are proportionate to what went wrong.  TAMS is a very specific example of it.  The figures involved can be quite high.  The stakes can be really high for the farm family.  In many instances, it is its once-in-a-generation investment and if someone is left in a situation where he or she cannot avail of it, it can have nightmarish implications for a family.  I am very conscious of that, particularly in terms of how we structure the schemes as part of the CAP strategic plan.  The terms and conditions of existing schemes are there, are auditable and are part of the contract signed up to.

Auditing is about ensuring there is no fraud.  There has been an acknowledgement of that in some cases, this was not fraud but - I use the term very loosely - &quot;negligence&quot; or involved mistakes on the part of the applicants.  In one case, we are talking about &euro;45,000, a huge sum of money.  Twice that amount was spent but that was what was due to be recouped.  They are repaying loans.  It is unique in the sense where one spends first and receives one's grant.  If one meets that type of difficulty, one is up to one's neck in it.  Therefore, I make that appeal to the Minister without delving into it.<\/p><p>Regarding forestry because it is probably the subject we discuss most here, I do not think any of us would have been surprised to see an underspend relating to afforestation because to be kind, the numbers are underwhelming in terms of the targets <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the actual outputs.  Without going into the intricacies of it, I met some constituents from west Cavan earlier who have an issue with what they see as the over-proliferation of Sitka spruce plantations in their areas.  The Minister would have heard similar stories coming from parts of Kerry and Leitrim.  This committee is very clear that we need to promote and expand the forestry sector.  What is the probability and possibility of ensuring that we have a balanced forestry strategy that works for the economy, the timber industry and the environment but also works for local communities in that it is regionally balanced across the board?  I think the next agri-environmental scheme will be pivotal when it comes to doing that and enticing farmers to re-engage with the forestry sector.

How it evolved has been well documented and discussed in this committee?  Very significant resources are in place in the Department.  Over the course of this year, we have been making increasing progress regarding licensing.  Around 3,500 licences have been issued this year compared with just over 2,500 for all of last year.  The dial is going in the right direction over the course of this year and is continuing to progress.  Over the past 11 weeks, an average of 113 new licences have been issued.  Afforestation has not been keeping pace with felling.  We have allocated ten ecologists specifically to afforestation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding getting things right in the long term and making them as streamlined and effective as possible, the implementation of the MacKinnon report is well under way through Project Woodland.  The board recently published its second interim report.

The board has also agreed prioritisation and effective and inclusive consultation on a shared vision and plan for a new forestry strategy.  Work on this has commenced.  This will be really important in terms of driving things forward.

The way we will do that is by lifting and increasing the licensing output.

We will keep the pressure on to keep those licences up.  It is a real priority for everyone.

The assessment was that as expenditure targeted at a support for young farmers, it was not necessarily the most effective way of doing that.  While it acts as an encouragement to land turnover, at the same time it was targeting farmers who were between the ages of 55 and 65 for early retirement.  We have many more farmers at pension age already than we would have in the category between 55 and 65 years.

I spent four and a half hours last Wednesday with all of the national presidents of the farm organisations and some of their key officers, along with all of the members of my own team.  I did a full four and a half hour session on CAP and climate change, dealing with these issues and where we are at the moment.  I also made it very clear in terms of how we step forward that, obviously, the first starting point was getting the sectoral targets right and getting them set for Irish agriculture in a way that was appropriate to what the sector can deliver.  I believe the range we have is ambitious but deliverable.  It will enable Irish agriculture to continue to produce the food - the milk and meat proteins - that we produce but to do so in a way that reduces the overall footprint and, in the process, adds value to that product and profitability at farm level for those producing that product.  Central to delivering those outcomes and those reductions in emissions is working with farmers to implement the various measures they can deliver and, in particular, working with farm leaders.  All of us must show the leadership that is required to deliver all of that.<\/p> <p>  I fully believe that will make Irish agriculture stronger and that it will get stronger over the next decade.  Any sector of the economy, or any national economy that is efficient from an emissions point of view and environmentally sustainable, can expect to do well in the next decade, and that is where Irish agriculture is at.  By international comparisons, we are a very sustainable food producing nation, and that is something we will continue to develop and double down on over the next decade and, in doing so, we will become stronger as an agricultural producing nation and as an income generating sector, particularly for farm families.<\/p> <p>  Central to that is working with farm organisations.  As I said, I spent a full afternoon with all of the national leaders last Wednesday.  I have had ongoing engagement throughout the CAP process with all of the national leaderships of all the farm organisations.  Obviously, that is something that has always happened within the CAP process and it happened again this time around.  Of course, I have supplemented that by having public meetings in each and every county in the country and speaking directly to every farmer who wanted to speak to me as part of the process to further develop that.  That has been in addition to the very significant ongoing engagement with the national farming organisations.  Now that the county-by-county meetings have concluded, we will continue that engagement with all of the farm organisations at national level to conclude the process of finalising the CAP strategic plan, which, legally, has to be completed by the end of December and submitted to the Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#T00300","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>On a final note, I stress the importance of that consultation with the farm organisations.

The Minister referred to some &euro;7 million for forestry.  Last week, at this committee, Teagasc officials gave a fairly sobering assessment that in the first five years after trees are planted, there is damn all in terms of sequestration.  We are in bother between now and 2030 because, basically, from 2016, although it is not the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility as he was not in office, we failed to plant even 50% of what we were projecting for several years and just 75% for the other few years.  The Teagasc officials made a damning statement that would frighten the daylights out of anybody when they said we would need to hold up the cutting of trees towards the end of this decade because we will be cutting a lot more than we are planting.<\/p> <p>  What responsibility do the people in the Department take for what has gone on?  Is there any such thing as accountability?  The job the Minister and his officials have at hand, with the climate Bill and all of that, is basically to offset one thing against the other and to make sure we are in tune.  Is it not frightening that while it is not the farmers&rsquo; fault and it is probably not any Minister's fault, this has been let linger on?  I know what the Minister said and everyone supported last year&rsquo;s Bill in regard to cutting trees and the licences for felling.  However, the dashboard shows we are still stragglers when it comes to giving out afforestation licences.  I was looking at the figures just yesterday and while they suggest we will have 4,000 licences this year, and that will be the headline, the fact is Coillte is getting a good shot at them at the moment, although I am not saying it does not need them, and it will have its environmental impact statements, EIS, done and all of that craic, and will be zooming them through fairly quick.  However, we need licences outside of that and we are struggling.<\/p> <p>  Does that concern the Minister?

That is important because it further incentivises that drive to afforest from the point of view of delivering our targets.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that, even this year, the afforestation is not replacing the felling, which is not a sustainable situation.  The Deputy knows the backdrop in regard to the change.

On the veterinary medicine regulation, we hear that vets are telling farmers at meetings around the country that if they are getting dosing materials for the cattle, it will involve a dung sample.  Members of this committee understood that, at a herd test, a farmer would acquire the doses for fluke and do out a plan with the vet.  That does not seem to add up based on what we are now hearing on the ground.  If a problem arises whereby a vet has to come out to look at a lock of cattle every time a prescription must be written, no farmer will be able to afford it.  Before anything is done, the system should be made workable for farmers.  The Minister should not allow a situation where they are caught with one person.<\/p> <p>  In the dairy sector in January, February and March, when many cows will be calving, the cows will need injections for scour and all the various problems that arise.  You cannot be going down the size of the biro for one calf and then going down the next day and the next day.  It needs to be put into perspective that farmers do not just give injections for the craic and that they need to be covered in this regard.  I ask the Minister to address this before anything is signed off.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will know better than I do, from his own area, what is happening in the organic farming sector.  I was talking to farmers from a few hills in Galway and Mayo in the past few days.  In my opinion their lamb is organic, but the problem is that they cannot get organic certification because their sheep are in a commonage where someone else might have sheep and because some farmers have had to destock because of designation related to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Their farming is like a brother or sister to organic farming because it is so close to it.  Could any sense be applied to increase our organic figures?

We have been making progress and it is an improving situation, thankfully.  We are in a different situation compared to this time last year, when we faced an increasingly challenging and disimproving situation in terms of supply.  While there is much work to be done, it is improving, progressing and going in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  Some of the steps we have taken have made a significant improvement.  At the back end of last year, we introduced the changes to the forestry appeal legislation.  At that stage, there was a backlog of about 1,000 cases on the forestry appeals committee's books.  We split that committee into four and resourced it more significantly.  As of today, it is hearing appeals of 25 cases, rather than 1,000.  That has been a significant improvement.  On the licensing system, progress continues to be made but there is undoubtedly a backlog which has led to delays and which we are addressing.<\/p> <p>  On the budget, I believe we will make the targets over the time ahead.  We have to drive on with that and key to that is the licensing system.  I outlined the work that is under way on reviewing what additional steps could be taken to improve it further.  The implementation of the Mackinnon report will also be important.  There are many different streams, including ash dieback, maintenance payments and roads building, that come under the overall forestry budget.  There is underspend this year because our licensing has not been what it should be but we have to reverse and address that as we get into next year and take it forward from there.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#V00700","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being before us with his officials.  I was looking at different savings through the organic scheme, TAMS, forestry and fisheries.  The Minister explained where the savings have been made.  We are talking about sheep welfare and going from &euro;10 to &euro;12 per ewe.  That will not happen this year for farmers who are getting payments.  The &euro;1.5 million saving from the organic scheme was mentioned.  I have a conflict of interest as my son is an organic farmer.  However, I have not seen an increase of any sort in the last 15 or 20 years in relation to the organic scheme, other than the increase of the registration fee for the farmer every year.  There is very little to be got out of that and it is difficult to look at &euro;1.5 million being saved and not being pumped back in to participants to encourage them to carry out their organic works even stronger than they are.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said &euro;3.3 million expenditure was saved from TAMS.  There are many people appealing their TAMS and it will be frustrating or upsetting for them to hear there is a saving of &euro;3.3 million when they have a genuine spend and have not been able to get their hands on their money.  The &euro;7 million savings in forestry is mainly due to there being no new planting.  I accept that the licensing delays were a factor, as the Minister said, but it is astonishing to think that &euro;7 million has been saved because we have not been able to sow forestry.  Every opportunity needs to be worked on to resolve that.  It is a crisis of huge proportions which will come back to bite us down the road.  We are not meeting any targets.  We are way off every target set in relation to forestry this year.  Somebody needs to put their hand in the air and take full responsibility.  The buck stops somewhere.  It is not with the landowners or the people who want to fell forestry.  It is held up all the way back to the person who wants to sow forestry.  There is no confidence among the public in relation to forestry sowing.<\/p> <p>  In fisheries, &euro;4.9 million was saved, while SFPA stated it had savings of &euro;2 million.  It is a tough time for fishermen.  Bar the decommissioning and talk of &euro;1 million on the fleet tie-up scheme, there is no compensation out there.  I have said for the last two or three years that a fund needs to be put in place for the many inshore fishermen who lost their material or equipment a couple of years ago due to bad storms.  There was not a brown cent for these guys and ladies who are trying to fish the seas in difficult times.  If we have &euro;4.9 million plus &euro;2 million in SFPA savings, that is a lot of money that could have been tied into a scheme.  Maybe a new scheme needs to be started like the rural social scheme which would be much easier for fishermen to get into.  Many of them are losing their jobs and scratching their heads at the moment.  They need answers and see none coming, only decommissioning, which means even more of them will be outside the system and out of work.<\/p> <p>  I see the Marine Institute is seeking a once-off allocation of &euro;5 million for data collection.<\/p><p>That is a lot of money for data collection.  What kind of data collection is the institute intending to carry out that requires &euro;5 million?  Is it looking at data collection in relation to quota that we are not getting out there?  Is it going to undertake some kind of research in that area?   What is the story?  It seems to me that &euro;5 million is a lot of money.  Perhaps the institute genuinely needs the money, but I am interested in hearing where it intends to use that money.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#V00800","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I will take the Deputy's final point first.  On the &euro;5 million allocated to the Marine Institute for data collection, we are reallocating some of the unspent funds from other sections to rectify what could be called an anomaly, or the situation whereby it was previously paid a year retrospectively.  We are using that &euro;5 million to bring it into line to ensure that it is paid in the year when it falls due.  I addressed that point earlier.<\/p> <p>  On supports for the fisheries sector, as the Deputy is aware, the fleet tie-up scheme is in place until the end of this year.  Some of the savings that I have identified are going specifically towards supporting fishermen in that sector, and in the whitefish sector, in particular.  It has been a really important scheme for supporting fishermen over the course of this autumn.  The introduction of the scheme was one of the first recommendations of the task force which I have brought forward and implemented.  It has been widely welcomed by those who have availed of it and take-up has been very strong.  It has been an important support.  As the Deputy is aware, the seafood sector task force was made up of fishers' representatives.  I brought the representatives together, as those who are in the sector and who make their livelihoods from the sector, to advise on the challenging outcome of Brexit and to advise the Government as to how we can best support and invest in their livelihoods, and how we can best battle on their behalf at European level in the years ahead.  There will be significant funding under the Brexit adjustment reserve to support the sector through that, and importantly so.<\/p> <p>  Otherwise, on the smaller savings that we are making, when a Department has an annual budget of &euro;1.9 billion and in addition, &euro;1.2 billion in direct payments which it administers, some changes always will be made in respect of what is profiled at the start of the year as the year progresses and life happens.  It happens in every walk of life and every profession.  In a Department with almost &euro;2 billion of spending, you will see things that do not quite work out as profiled.  That is why it is important to redirect and manage the Vote, and to involve the committee members in accounting for why that is happening.  On the reprofiling of funds, some of it is going directly to fishers through the tie-up scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#W00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We want it to be seen as a farming activity as well as, for example, farming the land through grassland.  It can be incorporated into the overall holding.  That is what we see happening internationally, in many cases.  There is great potential for that here.

First, there is a soil sampling scheme profile for 2021, which was originally allocated current expenditure.  There is a much larger allocation for it for 2022.  On reflection, as we developed the scheme, we decided that it was more appropriate for that scheme to be funded from capital funding rather than from current expenditure.  We are using the savings from TAMS to convert that scheme to capital expenditure in 2021.  It will be funded through a capital allocation from 2022 going forward.  We are creating a very important soil database with that funding.  It is a capital asset.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, the 2021 allocation for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme,  which is co-run with our colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is &euro;800,000.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment had classified the scheme as a capital-funded scheme; we had classified it as a current expenditure-funded scheme.  That was an anomaly, so we are converting the 2021 allocation to capital funding to match the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's accounting.  It is a technical issue and we are utilising TAMS savings for that purpose.

The first concerns ash dieback.  I, like many others, have campaigned vigorously on the issue of ash dieback.  I believe that what has been done for the plantations to date is inadequate.  The farmers' plantations suffered a disease that was completely outside of their control.  I will not go into the biosecurity issues or the question of who is at fault or whatever bit it is not helping our battle to get the afforestation figures up.  In my part of the country and that of Deputy Browne, there are many plantations with ash dieback.  It has left a sour taste in people's mouths.  The ash crop was going to be a very valuable cash crop, usually sown on relatively good land.  Now, the crop is worthless and in some cases, 30 years of growth has gone down the Swanee.  I have made the point to the Minister previously that if these plantation owners decide to replant, they should have access to premiums going forward.  It would be a huge gesture on the part of the Department.  It would give confidence back to the forestry industry that they are not the poor relation.  If an outbreak of TB or brucellosis occurred on a farm, the farmer would get compensation.  Ash dieback is a disease which, in many cases, has devastated farmers' pension plans.  I believe we have not done enough for them.  I would like the Minister to give thought to what I have said as regards premiums.  We all want to see afforestation figures going up.  If we could do something on ash dieback, it would start to give a feel-good factor back to the forestry industry.<\/p> <p>  The next point I wish to make concerns the agri-environmental schemes going forward.  I have spoken on the issue in the D&aacute;il and we spoke on it the other evening when we presented to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, the report that the committee put together last spring.  It is essential that agri-environmental schemes are married with afforestation.  Looking at the fact that farmers in GLAS were prohibited from going into afforestation in the last five years of GLAS makes a mockery of where we are trying to get in respect of climate change and reducing our emissions.  The farmers who would want to join an agri-environmental scheme would be the ones that we would be targeting for afforestation as well.  Those two schemes have to be married together in this round of CAP if we are to make any serious impression on our afforestation targets.<\/p> <p>  If needs be, I urge the Minister to meet the forestry groups.  They have developed proposals on this issue which they have sent to the committee.  We can pass them on to the Minister.  As I have said, it was the point we made very strongly when we presented the report in the D&aacute;il last Thursday evening to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  It is essential that we get it right this time round.  The number of farmers who opted for afforestation in the last five years of GLAS went down by around 80% to 90%.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is clear that the schemes as they were designed the last time around prohibited farmers from going into afforestation.  <\/p><p> Deputy Martin Browne spoke about money being left over in TAMS.  The rate of grant and most definitely the ceiling are out of touch with reality, given the increase in building costs.  A sum of &euro;80,000 would do very little work as we try to meet our emissions targets, try to improve water quality and all those issues.  With the price that chemical fertiliser will be next spring, the utilisation of slurry will be paramount for farmers.  All these things will require significant investment on farms.  Given how costs have increased, &euro;80,000 is out of touch with reality.  I urge the Minister to increase the ceiling of &euro;80,000 to make investment on farms more attractive for farmers.  In 2007 there was a far more attractive investment scheme for slurry storage.  I am not suggesting we go back to the scheme we had in 2007, but definitely the current scheme needs to be reviewed and revised upwards.  <\/p><p> I do not believe any other members picked up on a point relating to ANC.  I saw that &euro;1 million was not taken up because of stocking rate.  Is that &euro;1 million in total in ANC or is it &euro;1 million extra in the year of the Estimate we are discussing?  Is it possible to get a breakdown by county of what farmers do not meet stocking rate requirement on ANC?  I do not expect the Minister to have this this evening.  <\/p><p> While \"penalised\" might be the wrong word, I have been inundated by farmers who have had to return the money they received under the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme for 2019.  What will happen to the money that will be returned?  Could we give a fresh reference year for farmers to try to meet the stocking rate requirement?  Many farmers did not understand the intricacies of the scheme they went into.  It was an extremely complicated scheme.  Many people I am dealing with now felt if they reduced their stocking rate by 5% for a given period of the year, they would qualify.  Very few recognised that it was a calendar-year reduction.  It is galling for farmers who lost significant money in feeding cattle in that year.  The scheme was introduced at &euro;100 per head and now they are required to refund it.  I have raised this with the Minister before and I know it is not a simple request.  The scheme was 50% EU funded.  Could anything be done to give these farmers another opportunity to meet the stocking rate reduction requirements?  <\/p><p> The Department needs to have a fresh examination of designated land.  Land that has been designated has had its capital value decimated.  There are some schemes for hen harrier land etc.  However, none of these schemes has restored the capital value of this designated land.  If we are serious about meeting our afforestation targets, we need to look at the blanket ban on designated land.  I understand this was a national decision.  I have seen evidence showing that different stages of afforestation can enhance habitats rather than diminish them.  There is evidence to show that different stages of afforestation can actually help the species we are trying to protect with these blanket bans.<\/p><p> If we could plant a percentage of that designated land over, for example, a three-year window and then do more in the next three-year window, it would go a long way towards meeting our afforestation targets and would also restore the capital value of that land.  I am aware of designated land recently sold in my county for &euro;1,200 per hectare.  If it were eligible for planting it would make quadruple that amount.  The land has lost its capital value completely.  We are shooting ourselves in the foot in meeting our afforestation targets with a blanket ban on that land.  <\/p><p> As usual, I have a few simple questions for the Minister for some of which he may not have the answers available immediately.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#W00800","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I will first deal with the ash dieback.  I take the valid point the Chairman is making and it is a matter that the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I have discussed and we are reflecting on it.  It has been devastating for the farmers affected.  As the Chairman will know, a scheme was introduced in March 2013.  To date, the uptake has been low.  Earlier this year, &euro;7 million was paid out under the scheme in respect of approximately 1,000 ha.  In April 2018 the Department suspended that reconstitution scheme and announced a review of it.  A new scheme was opened on 22 June 2020.  We have had limited uptake on that so far with 268 applications received and 19 approvals issued to date.  The Chairman makes his points well and we are reflecting on the matter.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman's point about the agri-environmental schemes and afforestation is fair.  It is important for us to look at that in the context of putting together these new schemes for 2023 to 2027.  It is important both for afforestation and for organic farming that we do not have inbuilt unintentional disincentives making it harder to achieve our objectives.  The thinking must be cross-sectional and the objectives must support each other.  That is something we are aware of and I take the Chairman's point.  We will be keeping it closely in mind.  <\/p> <p>  I have proposed that the ceiling for the new TAMS be increased to &euro;90,000.  I have launched an updated cost review.  I take the Chairman's point.  Many people feel that ceiling should be larger.  As it currently stands, I have plans to increase that to &euro;90,000 and the costings will be updated when that is completed.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;1 million for ANC is to ensure we provide enough funding in the funding envelope to be able to cover ANC.  Every year up to 5,000 potential applicants do not meet the stocking requirements.  We allocate enough for what we believe will meet all applications.  However, that &euro;1 million saving reflects the fact that not as many people met the stocking requirement as we had provided for.  We were cautious in seeking to slightly overprovide to ensure we would definitely have enough funding to do it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021112300002#X00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Many of these farmers might not reach the retention and stocking rates until the end of December.

Overall, 33,000 farmers applied in the first instance.  Of these, 18,700 have exited the scheme clear, having met the 5% reduction.  Out of the 33,000 farmers, 18,700 are out the gap and are paid.  They will keep that payment.  Approximately 10,700 participants deferred and are still in deferment period.  The new reference period I set runs from January this year to December this year.  I set it in acknowledgement of the fact that many were off course, to try to give people the opportunity to reset.  I think it was in February that I put it in place.  It gives people a second chance to get straightened up and try to meet the 5% threshold if they were in trouble.  A total of 10,700 farmers availed of this extra year-long participation time.  There were 3,600 who did not opt for the extra year and had not met the 5% by the end of the original 12 months.  The total to be recouped from them is just over &euro;5 million.<\/p> <p>  We have 10,700 still in the scheme.  The analysis until September shows that out of the 10,700 in the new reference year, 2,100 of them are on track to meet the 5%.  A further 300 are between 4% and 5%.  They will have a partial recoupment.  This leaves 8,300 who are not on track to meet the 5% reduction.  Of the 8,300 who are not on track, 7,100 of them have increased their nitrates over the course of the reference year.  A total of 10,700 took the new reference year and, out of these, 2,100 will be okay, another 300 or so are above the 4% and, of the 8,300 who are under 4%, the vast majority have increased nitrates during the reference period.  It is not marginal.  It is likely that many of them made a decision they will not meet it and have taken a different pathway.<\/p> <p>  Looking at these figures as they stand, the total of 7,100 farmers would mean a potential recoupment of &euro;15 million when administrative checks are repeated in February.  Most are on track.  Money has been recouped from 3,600 because they did not avail of the new reference year.  Of those who took the new reference year, more than 2,000 are on track.  Up to 2,500 are likely to be okay.  Nitrates have increased for more than 7,000 of them.

The Energy Charter Treaty, ECT, is a multilateral agreement from the 1990s that has been ratified by all EU countries.  As of today, there are 53 contracting parties, including the EU.  Italy is the only EU country that has withdrawn from the treaty, having done so in 2016.  The treaty protects foreign investment in energy production without distinguishing between environmentally harmful and environmentally friendly energy sources.  Protection is given by means of private arbitration.  This means that foreign investors - and, as a French citizen, I would be considered a foreign investor in the committee's country, Ireland, and <i>vice versa<\/i>- can sue governments for any changes in their energy policies or subsidies.  As of today, there have been 143 investor-state dispute settlements under the Energy Charter Treaty, two thirds of which are related to changes in subsidies for renewable energy in Spain and Italy.  The rest of these cases, which are outside the EU, mainly relate to fossil fuels.<\/p><p>What we have started to see, and what will accelerate with the implementation of the carbon or climate neutrality target, is investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, cases in EU countries in respect of the phasing out of fossil fuel.  The Netherlands has been sued over the phasing out of coal power plants.  Germany is to be sued again.  It was sued in the past over its coal and nuclear phase-out.  The German Government signed an agreement with investors to provide them with compensation.  The compensation amounts to billions of euro if they do not sue the German Government using the Energy Charter Treaty.

Basically, the ECT is a real threat to the implementation of the climate neutrality target and the Paris Agreement, not only in the EU but also outside it, because the new strategy is to extend the ECT to African countries and developing countries.

I hope I can contribute meaningfully to its consultations on what I believe is surely one of the most important problems we will face in our lifetimes.  Climate change is an inescapable problem that does not know borders or nationality.  In deciding how best to contribute to this committee's work, I decided I would like to shed some light on the Energy Charter Treaty and ISDS provisions in general, in respect of both energy security and the EU green transition.<\/p> <p>  I find myself agreeing with several remarks very astutely made by Dr. Saheb but would like to add nuance to the analysis.  The question that has guided my brief opening statement concerns whether the Energy Charter Treaty as it is today &mdash; the phrase \"as it is today\" is an important nuance &mdash; is a liability in realising the ambitious climate change and sustainable development goals.  Unfortunately, I believe the answer to that question is \"Yes\".  I say \"unfortunately\" because I am not in principle opposed to the Energy Charter Treaty and believe it has some redeeming qualities.  One of its benefits is that it regulates the trade and transit of energy.<\/p> <p>  ISDS provisions are certainly the most controversial provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty but they are only a part of it.  Although the Energy Charter Treaty could ensure or help to ensure the EU&rsquo;s security of energy supply, it is the ISDS provisions that likely bring themselves to bear on the EU's green transition.  I will give a brief explanation as to why that is the case.  I will try to show members some of the high-level tendencies that I believe show the important conflict that will arise in the years to come.<\/p> <p>  The Energy Charter Treaty, as many people know, was concluded with an eye to our eastern and central eastern neighbours to ensure the protection of investments there, thereby creating stability, prosperity and stable regimes and, as a consequence, a stable energy supply.  That was important in the 1990s, particularly with respect to the precarious circumstances after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The treaty was very successful then.  However, since that time, the situation has changed considerably, as we all know.  First, Russia, one of the major suppliers of energy to our east, definitively withdrew from the Energy Charter Treaty.  A little later, the EU expanded to the east, meaning the only non-EU states between the Union and Russia were Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus.  The EU also gained competence in respect of energy as a policy matter.  As a result, we have paid much more attention to energy security in the European neighbourhood policy, which is extended by the energy charter community to other states and by association agreements we conclude with other states, such as Ukraine.  A recent agreement covers energy, trade and transit.<\/p> <p>  The Energy Charter Treaty has lost much of its original rationale, which involved investment protection in the eastern and central eastern regions, but that shift was reflected in a rather recent energy charter-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael de Boeck"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637625600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>The recent reform of the energy charter process reflects the shift by putting more emphasis on broadening the geographic membership of the charter.  This could help to diversify the energy supply, including with regard to liquid natural gas and renewables.  I will not wade too far into that because my primary area of expertise is the ISDS provisions, which I will now discuss.<\/p> <p>  I am sure members have already heard arguments from others who testified before this committee.<\/p><p>I want to address a counterargument often raised by proponents of ISDS and the Energy Charter Treaty, namely, the working of Article 19.  It is often said that the Energy Charter Treaty already protects the regulatory margin of host states to a good extent in relation to environmental protection.  I would offer the retort that the idea that Article 19 sufficiently incorporates environmental protection is a fallacy because that protection is only put into the context of investment protection principles on long-term energy investments, that is to say, that the host state may subject investments to conditions, impact assessments, the performance of building conditions, etc.  However, it can only do so <i>ex ante<\/i>.  It does not actually provide for an <i>ex post<\/i>right for a host state to change its regulatory framework even for the protection of the environment.  Environment protection is then recognised as part of the regulatory framework, which can change over time within certain limits, but it is not recognised at the level of an overriding justification for breaches of the investment protection principles.  That, in legal terms, is a wholly different dynamic than, for instance, a carve-out provision or an exception.  <br\/><br\/>Moreover, as we see in practice, Article 19 is actually not subject to the ISDS provisions, yet we see a number of cases that concern regulatory incentive regimes, particularly for solar energy such as in Spain, the Czech Republic and Italy that have rather mixed outcomes.  The reality is that investors who have legitimate expectations under international investment law to have regulatory stability may in fact block some of the needed reforms or at least render them excessively costly.<br\/><br\/>To come back to the idea of presenting the high-level tendencies, we have to recognise that we are at the precipice of a tremendous transition effort, which is almost inevitably likely to affect the regulator frameworks of many, if not all, sectors.  We will fund that transition effort with a staggering &euro;750 billion EU investment fund.  However, we risk subsidising or incentivising investments with taxpayers' money only then to be faced with claims for damages and lost profits.  This is an important caveat because whereas under national law the state can be sued for damages but not lost profits, under international investment law, a state can also be sued for lost profits.  What we have then incentivised with taxpayers' money could ultimately turn against us in a suit for lost profits when the original regulatory efforts at the beginning of the long-term investment - investments could be for 25 or 30 years - turn out to be insufficient and we have to recalibrate our environmental measures in order to meet targets.  That is a real risk.<br\/><br\/>My overarching message is that the Energy Charter Treaty has some merit with regard to all the other provisions but probably not with regard to the ISDS provisions as they are now.  It is a fact that the Energy Charter Treaty is currently being modernised but the results of that process are as yet very unsure and it is very hard to make any prediction on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael de Boeck","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>This meeting is confined to a maximum of three hours.

I have a high-level question which I will address to both the witnesses.  Let us take a step back.  The Energy Charter Treaty was introduced during the seismic political shift that took place 30 years ago when the Soviet Union collapsed.  It was brought in for very good reasons, namely, to ensure the continued energy flow to countries, especially in Europe.  Given that we are in another seismic period with respect to climate change, is there an argument or is there time to go back and look at the purpose of the Energy Charter Treaty?  Should it be thrown out?  Is that feasible?  If not, is the treaty aligned with the goals under the Paris Agreement and the ambition to limit warming over the pre-industrial average to 1.5&deg;C or at most 2&deg;C?  Is it aligned with the sustainable development goals?  If not, what can be done to ensure that it is?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#C00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Energy Charter Treaty made sense in the 1990s.  However, when Russia withdrew in 2009 the treaty's <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>disappeared.  That is why today the treaty does not make sense today.  The EU and the energy sector do not need it.  One of the main arguments made is that one of the treaty's benefits is to regulate trade and transit in the energy sector.  However, this is already done in the World Trade Organization.  The Energy Charter Treaty made sense at the time because we did not have the WTO, the energy community treaty and the various partnerships the EU has built since the 1990s.  Today, the Energy Charter Treaty would be useful to us for our relations in respect of energy with Afghanistan, although it is not really a provider of energy to us; Australia, which was providing us with coal but withdrew from the treaty only recently and we no longer need because it is not important for our energy security; and Jordan, Mongolia and Yemen, which are not important for our energy security.  These are the only countries which are not covered and with which we do not have any other agreement for our energy security.  We have different kinds of agreement with all other countries that are parties to the Energy Charter Treaty.  Russia, the main provider of fossil fuels to Europe, has joined the WTO and withdrawn from the treaty.  Therefore, from an energy security perspective, the ECT does not make sense.<br\/><br\/>From the flow of investment perspective, with respect to investment in ECT contracting parties, we see that EU investors invest in EU counties and non-EU investors, namely, those from former Soviet Union republics, invest in those republics.

When you estimate the investments already protected under the ECT, they are found to be above the remaining carbon budget for all the EU 28, that calculation relating to the time when the UK was in the EU.

In practical terms, is unanimity required to replace this agreement with another?<\/p><p>Second, I wish to understand the exact nature of the protection.  I know that modern protections in investor disputes protect a foreign investor from rules that are not being applied to domestic investors, but in the case of climate action, we would be applying the same regulations to all investors.  That would be our ambition.  Is that distinction of discriminatory rules not part of this agreement such that, even if our national fossil fuel companies are having to change their practices, the others can get damages for either damage or lost profits?<\/p><p>Does this existing treaty anticipate anything like <i>force majeure<\/i>, which is really what is happening here in that complete transformation is necessary?  No treaty, you would think, would give away the ability to respond to an existential crisis of this nature.  Has this one been particularly badly drawn?<\/p><p>Finally, emissions trading forces coal generators, for example, to pay much higher carbon taxes than gas or renewable generators.  Has that already triggered a series of claims by the fossil fuel industry against the emissions trading system, ETS?  It seems that almost everything the EU is doing and has been doing for many years could potentially be portrayed as inflicting either damage or a lost expectation of profits in respect of coal producers, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#D02000","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Which of our witnesses would like to go first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#D02100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Bruton's question.<\/p><p>To amend the treaty, we need a unanimous vote from all the contracting parties, which limits the room for manoeuvre for EU countries.

Under the current set-up, there is not a lot of room to manoeuvre.  We are a contracting party to an international agreement.  That agreement sets out certain rules with which we are no longer very happy and we would like to modify them.  One option is to withdraw.  We can do that jointly with all of the EU member states but then, of course, we would be, from the perspective of international law, unilaterally withdrawing states, and the consequence of that would be to lock in the investment protections that are guaranteed in that treaty for another 20 years.  That is not our intent.  The intent is to replace the current framework, but that has to happen through the energy charter itself, with a treaty modification.  That requires unanimity of all the parties.  That is why the European Commission is currently negotiating for a change in almost all the notions and definitions, as is clear if one looks at the draft text, several of the protection standards and more qualified protection standards, and the exceptions.  What are the standards?  One of the difficulties with and criticisms of international law is that the provisions that contain the investment protection standards are rather vague and they are interpreted by many different international investment tribunals that are composed on an <i>ad hoc <\/i>basis.  That is why one of the envisaged changes is to have a sort of appellate body that could be responsible for a kind of co-ordination of the different strands in the jurisprudence.<br\/><br\/>All of these different protections are interpreted, sometimes with quite a bit of divergence.  The most well known is the protection of fair and equitable treatment.  Even its name is rather vague.  One of the contents of that particular standard of protection is whether the investor had a legitimate expectation.  The difficulty - and this has particularly been the case in the Spanish, Czech and Italian solar cases - is in determining when an investor has a legitimate expectation.  Tribunals have reached diverging reasonings on that issue.  I refer to whether there has to be a specific commitment on the part of the host state.  If the host state makes a specific commitment in a contract, or any type of commercial agreement, to induce investors to make an investment in its territory, that would be seen as giving rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the investor that the regulatory regime will not change or, at least, not change to such an extent that it would alter the economic rationale of the investment.  Some tribunals, however, have determined that an implicit commitment of the host state <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the investor could lead to legitimate expectations and, therefore, the mere fact that a regulatory regime exists - such as, in the Spanish case, an incentive subsidy for solar energy - automatically creates a legitimate expectation on the part of the investor that the regime will not radically alter.  Of course, there are always definitional problems such as what is radical and what constitutes changing the economic rationale of the investment.  One of the major criticisms of investment arbitration is that it is all one-off decisions that try to meander to a consistent strand of jurisprudence but there is no one co-ordinating it.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the investment standards, the provisions from the international treaty are very vague, so it leaves a lot of leeway for the investment tribunals to make those determinations.  That was particularly the case in respect of treaties dating from the 1990s, such as the Energy Charter Treaty and all of what we now call the older generation of bilateral investment treaties.  The idea of the European Commission and the member states is that all of the new generation free trade and investment agreements that are concluded by the European Union or by the member states, subject to an authorisation by the Union, should contain qualified investment protection standards, which simply means more lengthy clauses that clearly delineate the scope and what is covered.  Of course, those only exist once they have been concluded.  Unless they have been concluded, the old regime still applies.<br\/><br\/>As regards exceptions, there are very few exceptions in the treaties that were concluded in the 1990s.  Very little attention was paid to that.  One of the things that has changed in the practice of the conclusion of investment agreements is that far more attention is being offered to qualifications of scope, exceptions, justifications for breaches, etc.  They would not then actually be breaches.  <br\/><br\/>As regards the question on the emissions trading system, I apologise, but I am not competent to answer it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael de Boeck"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. de Boeck for his answer.

Second, this proposal was rejected by the contracting parties.  Whatever will be agreed, by the end there is a need to have a unanimous vote.  The treaty cannot be amended unless there is a unanimous vote.<\/p> <p>  As regards whether there are any force measures, the treaty does not foresee that at all.  The EU has been trying to introduce the right to regulate because, basically, when a country is a party to this treaty, it loses its right to regulate its energy sector.  This is what we have learned over time.  The EU has been trying to introduce the right to regulate.  At present, Japan, which is another contracting party, and an important one in terms of contribution to the ECT secretariat, is completely opposed to the right to regulate and to modernisation in principle.

It is very important to distinguish between the fact we have the current Energy Charter Treaty, as Dr. de Boeck said, and the modernisation process and how likely it is for that modernisation process to achieve anything, given the resistance.  We know Japan is on record as saying it does not think the treaty needs changing at all.  Is valuable time being wasted in addressing climate action by trying to amend a treaty that is unlikely to be amended because of the requirement for unanimity?  Even if it is amended, and even if the EU proposals were all accepted in their entirety, it still would not make the agreement Paris-compliant.<\/p> <p>  Neither speaker referred to Article 16 of the treaty.  While I am not a legal expert, my understanding is that it does not matter what other international agreements a country signs up to, if the provisions of those agreements are less favourable than the ECT, then the tribunal accepts Article 16 as the provision that it is going to be protected under.  What does that mean for the Paris Agreement but also the ECJ ruling in both in the Achmea case and the more recent one on the ECT specifically?  The tribunals are saying, &ldquo;That is not our problem.&rdquo;  If it is not compatible with EU law, it is not their problem because countries are obliged to protect the investors under the treaty.  I would like the witnesses&rsquo; views on that.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Saheb touched on the ethical question of trying to carve out an intra-EU dispute, or to remove those intra-EU disputes while expanding the treaty into the oil and gas rich global South, which will protect European investors going into those countries.

It is unlikely that the treaty could be made Paris-compatible.  The time and great effort that, as Europeans, we are putting into the fake modernisation of this treaty is a waste of time.<\/p> <p>  The second question is on Article 16.  The treaty is in practice above any other international agreement or treaty.  This is how the intra-EU cases have been justified so far by private arbitrators.  There is a high risk that the ECJ ruling shows that the intra-EU disputes violate EU law, which is something that several other lawyers used to say.  It is good to have this ruling from the ECJ.  However, it is likely that arbitrators outside the EU will not consider this ruling and, again, this means a continuation of the treaty.  The risk of continuation is quite high, even for intra-EU disputes.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the ethical question, as someone who is at the same time from the global North and the global South, I feel uncomfortable that my country, France, and my other continent, Europe, still see the South as just a source for our investors in the North, without taking into account that climate change does not recognise our administrative borders and that the global South is in huge need of moving directly and leapfrogging from its current situation, where there is a lack of access to energy, directly to renewable energy.  As a climate change scientist, I know this is scientifically doable.  That is why I feel extremely bad and sorry for the global South if the global South is locked in the treaty because we do not manage, as Europeans, to have the courage to end this treaty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Yamina Saheb"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Let me the address the question on Article 16.  It acts like what I would call a ratchet in that it always provides the highest possible protection to the investor and it never goes down.  The argument on the part of the European Commission, in some of the cases where it has intervened as <i>amicus curiae<\/i>in this area, is that the ECT had in fact been replaced between the member states because they acceded to the EU treaties.  The legal basis for that was article 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, namely, that a prior agreement was terminated by accession to a later agreement.  That was never accepted by any of the investment tribunals that had to rule on this.  It was also because there was in fact a failure of express notification and it was not clear at all whether the intention was to terminate the ECT, given there was also a need for internal markets in energy.<br\/><br\/>The following argument is then whether, on the basis of a conflict between successive treaties, one could also argue that the EU treaties should prevail over the application of the ECT, under Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.  This was also not accepted by any of the investment tribunals, as a consequence of which we are at present simply faced with two legal regimes and two treaty regimes that apply side by side.  I agree with Dr. Saheb that there is the high likelihood that the ECJ rulings recently involving Achmea, Komstroy and PL Holdings will not stop investment arbitrations between member states, that is to say, between an investor of one member state and another member state.<br\/><br\/>As a legal analysis, that is not because it is invalid but simply because it is beyond the reach of EU law.  EU law, as the court famously said in Van Gend en Loos and Costa <i>v<\/i>. ENEL, is a new and autonomous legal order and it is distinct from national and international law.  The consequence, on the flipside of the coin, is that if the ECJ makes a ruling between member states, it is not necessarily binding in international law.  Therefore, the validity of the commitments under international law is simply not affected by the Achmea and Komstroy judgments.<\/p><p>Hence, investment tribunals will simply continue for as long as the legal regime applies.  Senator Boylan also asked whether we are simply wasting our time in trying to amend the ECT.  I would say &ldquo;No&rdquo;; we are not wasting our time at all.  Given the lack of decent alternatives, we need to keep pushing and going for that as there is no alternative.

The &euro;2.15 trillion figure is an estimate of the investment in fossil fuels that has already been made and is already protected by the ECT, and the investment that will be protected until 2050 if we do not phase out the protection of fossil fuels in all the ECT contracting parties.  These are stranded assets.  The &euro;1.3 trillion figure is the estimate of potential ISDS cases that may occur because of the implementation of the Paris Agreement in ECT contracting parties.  This means that we have to stop these fossil fuel installations earlier as these will trigger ISDS cases.<\/p> <p>  On the question of a few cases that are well known, Germany has been sued three times so far and there are two cases that are very well known.  One case was related to the phase-out of nuclear power.  Germany has been sued twice by the Swedish Vattenfall company.  One of these cases was related to the phase-out of nuclear power plants.  The company asked for &euro;1.4 billion.  The arbitration on this case was done in the US.  As the Deputy will see, the tribunal was not in the EU.  The other German case, involving Vattenfall again, related to coal-powered plants and they asked for &euro;4.3 billion.  This case relates to the pollution of a river next to Hamburg, if I remember correctly, and to the impact of using coal-powered plants.<\/p> <p>  The last case I will mention in Germany, which is a new one, relates to the changes in subsidies for wind-powered plants.  One can see what happened in Spain and then in Italy because of the Spanish and Italian cases.  All of the Spanish cases are related to changes in subsidies in renewables.  In the Italian cases, there is one that is related to the ending of the licence for exploring fossil fuels in the sea around Italy with a British company.<\/p> <p>  In the estimate I provided, I did not include at that time the phase-out of subsidies because it was not actually on the table.  If one, however, includes the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies as called for by COP26, this figure will increase to a much higher one.   <\/p> <p>  The Deputy concluded by asking if it is possible to make the ECT compatible with the Paris Agreement.  I do not think that it is possible because to amend the treaty, one needs a unanimous vote.  That is why I consider it a waste of time to discuss this treaty.  The countries, parties and the current constituency of the treaty include countries making income out of fossil fuels.  In some countries like Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, fossil fuels account for more than 10% of GDP.  If more than 10% of your country&rsquo;s GDP came from fossil fuels, would you phase out fossil fuel investment protection?  The answer is obviously &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If you have the right to vote to phase out fossil fuel protection, would you vote to phase out fossil fuel protection?  The answer again is obviously &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I do not think the current constituency of the ECT allows it to become compatible with the Paris Agreement.  In any event, the EU proposal is not compatible with the Paris Agreement because it is about not protecting new fossil fuel investment but keeping the protection of the existing investment which is not compatible with the Paris Agreement.  The International Energy Agency report, Net Zero by 2050, says that by 2025 we should stop investment in fossil fuels.  One can see, therefore, that it is not compatible.<\/p> <p>  What is the solution then?  The ideal solution from the climate and justice perspective for areas of the south would be that all contracting parties come together to end the ECT.  They could sincerely do this, but it is not on the negotiation table because of the differences in the implementation of the Paris Agreement between different countries and the position of Japan, which is very bad from a climate perspective because its position is very negative and conservative.<\/p> <p>  The only hope is that the Europeans, the EU countries, withdraw collectively.  Why do we need a collective withdrawal?  If we have a collective withdrawal, we could decide between ourselves to end the sunset clause between ourselves.  By doing this, we would end the protection of more than 60% of the foreign investments in the EU.  This would be one outcome of the collective withdrawal.  The other outcome is that if we withdraw collectively, there will be no one to finance the expansion of the ECT to the global south because this expansion is financed with our money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Yamina Saheb"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Saheb very much.

I agree with Dr. Saheb.  I would like to add one nuance, which is that if we all collectively decide to withdraw from the ECT, it does not seem self-evident to me that we get to decide between ourselves to disapply the so-called sunset or survival clauses.  The applicable principle would be Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which allows an <i>inter se<\/i>modification of certain commitments in an international treaty between certain of the parties only.  That is, however, subject to certain limitations which are not, I believe, met in this case.  For instance, it has to be allowed by the treaty that is being modified, which is not the case with the ECT, if I am not mistaken.  This modification may also not concern an essential provision.  The argument on the part of any investor bringing a claim would be that the ISDS is the absolute and most critical protection contained within the ECT.<\/p><p>I have a mind to think an investment tribunal would probably agree with that.  I am not so sure, therefore, that if we decide to simply upend this process and leave and then agree between ourselves to disapply the survival clauses, investment tribunals would see it the same way.  That said, the result would be that we would have to apply the protections for another 20 years.  If we were to leave unilaterally, the result would probably be the same, given that we may not have an agreement between all the parties.<\/p><p> The other part of the question that we have not touched upon was what should be the position of the Irish Government.  The Energy Charter Treaty is a mixed agreement.  It is being negotiated by the European Commission, but it would be concluded by the European Union and the member states themselves.  There is a certain division of competences that the Court of Justice of the European Union already clarified in several cases, most notably Opinion 2\/15.  The main takeaway from that is that since the Lisbon Treaty, under Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, foreign direct investment, FDI, is an exclusive competence of the European Union.  By contrast, because the article explicitly refers to foreign direct investments, it does not include foreign indirect investments.  However, as the court reasoned, that belongs to a shared competence of the EU.<\/p><p> The term \"shared competences\" does not actually mean that the EU and the member states must act at the same time, as the members probably very well know.  It means that the EU might also act alone.  It is not entirely clear to what extent a member state, as such, has bargaining power here.  The control would probably have to be indirect through the trade policy committee in the EU Council, I suspect and, of course, at the moment ratification, because Ireland will need to ratify it.  A similar thing happened with the Canadian Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, which was also a mixed agreement.  It was ultimately not ratified by Cyprus, if I am not mistaken, because there was insufficient protection of halloumi cheese.  That is of course a legitimate concern for Cyprus, but the consequence of non-ratification by one of the member states is that the treaty does not enter into force for any of the EU member states.<\/p><p> There are certain authors who consider that member states have an obligation to ratify a mixed agreement once it has been concluded by the European Union, but that is not a certainty.  It has not been said so far by the Court of Justice of the European Union.  Therefore, I would think that if the Energy Charter Treaty moves forward in a form that is no improvement, then the Irish Parliament could in this case exert some control by refusing to ratify that agreement.  Of course, whether that is useful in this case is a bit of a question, since the former agreement would then remain in force.  It does not seem to be an attractive option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael de Boeck","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>May I add one further point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Yamina Saheb"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#H00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>In theory, what was known in 2019 before the negotiations on modernisation started was that regarding the amended treaty the EU, representing member states, had a mandate from the European Council to negotiate on behalf of the member states.  I guess there is an Irish representative in these negotiations, as representatives from all the member states attend.  Those representatives attend meetings, but it is the EU that talks on behalf of all 27 member states.  Then, if an agreement is reached, what will happen is that the treaty should be ratified at the same time by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.  I do not see, for example, how some of the European national parliaments could ratify a treaty that keeps protections for fossil fuels.  What this means in practice is that if our parliaments do not ratify the amended treaty, then it will be necessary to have two thirds of the contracting parties ratify the amended treaty to allow it to be implemented.  It is very difficult to reach this two thirds proportion of governments.<\/p> <p>  What is happening now in the context of modernisation is that an attempt is being made to find a way to avoid an amendment being made to the treaty.  I do not know if it is possible for the legal experts to find a way to avoid an amendment, but if it proved possible then it would not be necessary for the national parliaments to ratify the agreement.  This is what has happened in the past.  Changes were made in the transit articles of the treaty and that did not need an amendment to be made by national parliaments.  That is all I have to say by way of clarification.  Something to keep in mind for the Irish Parliament is how it would explain to citizens that it is ratifying a treaty that continues to provide protections for fossil fuels.  What it means overall is that in the meantime the current treaty remains as it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Yamina Saheb"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Saheb.

One of the questions on Ireland&rsquo;s position concerns not what the country&rsquo;s position would be on the modernisation of the treaty, but this question of whether Ireland&rsquo;s position should now follow France and Spain in saying that the EU should walk away.  That is the more important question.  Anyone who has followed these long-winded negotiations in any detail will have seen that the reports are saying that no headway is being made at all.  It would be more interesting to hear about what position Ireland should take in that regard.  Should it join France and Spain and adopt their stance?  I think more countries are coming around to that position.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect of interest to me, and I have read the paper written by Dr. Saheb on the modernisation of the Energy Charter Treaty, concerns the impact of third-party funding and investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, and how this is facilitating more ISDS cases being taken.  Regarding the right to regulate, and a fight about CETA is under way in our national parliament now but I will not go into detail on that now, often when we read about the tribunals in this regard, in those papers which are available to the public, it is the case that they will recognise a state's right to regulate.  The issue, however, is how much it costs a state to regulate in that context.  Even if the EU does get its amendments in concerning the right to regulate and they are accepted, the key question then will be the cost to the citizens.  If we are going to be undertaking the transition to a decarbonised future by staying in the Energy Charter Treaty, are we just making the transition much more expensive for ordinary people, when it is already going to be very expensive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#H00600","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Who wishes to go first in answering?

It is not just France and Spain.  France was the first country to send a letter that was made public, and it was followed by Spain.  Poland, however, is also pushing for the withdrawal, as is Greece.  One of the Baltic states has also adopted this position, as has one of the Nordic states.<\/p><p>We already have at least six countries and, to my knowledge, the French Government is trying to build, with the Spanish Government, a coalition of countries that may join the idea of a collective withdrawal.  Given the climate emergency situation and given we cannot amend the treaty in such a way that we remove the protection of fossil fuels, I think collective withdrawal is an option we should look at more carefully.  The French letter asked the Commission to assess the implications of collective withdrawal.  To my knowledge, this kind of assessment has not been published by the European Commission, so if Ireland could join in again asking the Commission to do this assessment, that would be good.<\/p><p> Are we going to make the transition more costly if we stay in the treaty?  This is obvious.  We will have more cases.  In 2018, I first said we will have cases like the one in the Netherlands, or the German case where they signed an agreement to avoid the ISDS case and that agreement was for several billion euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  At that time, people could not understand that it was going to happen because only a few people were able to understand the IPCC report and the implications of the 1.5&deg;C target for our countries.  There is no doubt that by staying in the treaty, the cost will be extremely high for us.  Even when countries win - Spain, for example, won a few cases - they have to pay for the legal costs, and it is quite costly.  This money should go to the transition.  It should go to support energy-poor people in our countries.  I do not see, as a citizen, why our taxpayers should pay the polluters to stop polluting.  Basically, it is as if someone who commits crime in our country is paid to stop committing crime.  This is what we are doing rather than doing anything against the crime.  Actually, climate change is crime.  It is not yet recognised as ecocide but that will come in the future.  People are already dying because of climate change, and we already have some cases in the EU after what happened this summer, and we expect to have more cases.  We will see following the IPCC report, especially report No. 2 this coming February, that the climate risks are extremely high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Yamina Saheb","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>That was also the final part of my opening statement.  It is common sense that the ISDS will probably raise the cost of the enormous transition we have ahead of us.

In English, we would say &ldquo;bite the bullet&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>  I would like to offer one additional rationale, one that we have not touched on yet and one that is also complicating the discussion a little bit, and that is the Komstroy case, which we have referenced several times.  That is the case of the European Court of Justice where it held that the application of the Energy Charter Treaty as between two EU member states, and so between a member state and an investor in another member state, is not compatible with EU law.  We have already said that one of the problems there is that it is not clear whether that conclusion also applies on the international plane and, therefore, it undermines the international tribunal.<\/p> <p>  Another problem that arises from this, and that will probably continue to exist even in the modernised treaty with an exclusion for the intra-EU and extra-EU dimension, is that one can go to pretty much every big law firm to see what techniques they offer for restructuring investments that are currently within the EU to outside of the EU and, therefore, pick and choose which investment protection treaties they would like to use to protect their investments.

The origin of international investment law is a little bit shrouded in alternative argumentations.  The mainstream argumentation that is being given for the rise of international investment law is obviously the premise that offering investor-state dispute resolution clauses, and so dispute resolution independent from the national courts of the host member state where the investment is made, would offer a sense of security for an investor to go ahead and go abroad to regions where, at the time, there was not a strongly developed justice system in place.  In that sense, offering these investor dispute resolution provisions also incentivised the flow of direct investment capital into a region that could really use that capital to start building its economy and building its know-how.  The effectiveness of that premise is disputed and there are a lot of studies out there going both ways.  There are a lot of studies that say there is absolutely no link between offering ISDS and increased foreign direct investment, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It is a very debated premise.<br\/><br\/>An alternative argumentation that has been made by Lauge Poulsen, that I thought very good, is that it is a form of bounded rationality in the sense that everyone was doing this.<\/p><p>The World Bank started advancing these collateral investment treaties.  They were perceived as being good for business, good for visibility and everyone hopped on the bandwagon, especially all of the least developed nations, to show themselves as liberalising their economy and welcoming foreign investment, etc.  That is the origin.  I do not know whether that is a sinister or deliberate attempt to resume colonisation in an economic way.  I am not really a party to that interpretation of history because I am naive I still believe that people are not inherently sinister.  There is, however, obviously some rationale for saying if we are dealing with a region where there is a lack of established justice, there are benefits to appointing a third party to make a determination.  The question is whether that still applies to the European Union.  I think the answer is quite obviously that it does not, but of course we are not without fault.  We always have to be a little bit careful about that.  Investment protection within the European Union is not yet really comprehensive and there are areas where we can improve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael de Boeck","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. de Boeck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#K00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>May I ask one other question,?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#K00300","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#K00400","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>The committee heard recently at another meeting that the treaty might be a good idea because it will protect investors in renewable energy.

The proposal from the Commission was to stop the protection of new investment in fossil fuels by the time the treaty will be amended, which we do not know, because one thing we need to keep in mind is that there is no end date for the modernisation process.  This is also something that Ireland and other countries should ask for.  There is no end date.  The EU proposed to keep the protection of investment in fossil fuels that are already protected, and in the case of gas, until 2040, if we could convert them to hydrogen.  This proposal was rejected by the contracting parties and what they are discussing now is the differentiated phase-out of the protection of fossil fuels.  There is no agreement yet about what that will mean and how it is going to be.  One of the proposals that was discussed last month was that in the EU we will not protect new investment in fossil fuels but it will continue for the existing ones.  Existing EU fossil fuel companies such as Total or BP will still be protected in countries where there is no phase-out of the protection of fossil fuels.  That was one of the options on the table, but there was no agreement on it.<\/p> <p>  The main points we need to keep in mind is that during this decade, if we look at the International Energy Agency report, it is saying that by 2050 we should not invest in fossil fuels any more, so it is during this decade, from a climate perspective, that we need to phase out all fossil fuels.  What it means for us, those who are parties to the ECT, is that when we will have to phase out anyway, we will be sued and taxpayers' money will be used for the compensation of fossil fuel companies.  This is what is going to happen.  It has already started, but it is going to accelerate.

I am interested in what Dr. Saheb says about the compensation piece because this was a very strong narrative coming from COP 26, whereby there is a very hard line being held in terms of compensation for loss and damage to the global south, but many of the major extractive and fossil fuel corporations seemed to anticipate the pay-outs they would get, either as subsidies for their new branches if they get into renewable energy, or as compensation for the price of states' exiting.<\/p> <p>  I will not go deeper into the philosophy of it, but I heard an interesting analogy with the exit from slavery.  We had this phenomenon where it was described as a major system change in the economy based on an extractive exploitative model on which a lot of economic activity is based and transitioning away from it involved massive compensation to the slave owners even up until the 1990s.  That became a huge economic drain on states as some of them are still paying for it.  It certainly was the case up to the 1990s in the UK.  There was huge resistance to reparation for slavery.  I use this not because of the historically interesting fact but because it is an example we need to learn from.  We are making a massive system change.  This is not the normal run of course of business.  I would like the views of the witnesses on when we are making a system change such as that, what is the extent to which baggage such as these treaties affect it?  I want to focus on developing countries in particular.  If Europe were to have a co-ordinated exit from the Energy Charter Treaty, which is being advocated for strongly by many, what would be the potential implications for developing countries?  We know at the moment there is talk of a co-ordinated exit.  There is a discussion among countries in the EU of us holding environmental standards higher, but it is still a fact that European companies may take actions against governments in developing countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021112300002#K01300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Does Senator Higgins have further questions?

There is some way to steer the development of the interpretation of the investment treaty through that joint committee.<br\/><br\/>As for the enforcement of the awards, once the arbitral tribunal has rendered an award then we actually need to look at the legal framework governing the award.  That can differ along the institutional rules that were used to conduct the proceedings.  One can either use the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, investment arbitration tribunal and its rules, a non-central <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangement or any of the existing institutional arbitral institutions, of which there are quite a few.  Those are the institutional rules.  The International Court of Arbitration and the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce are very well-known examples.  What does that mean?  It means that in the end, we have an award that is recognised in an international court in accordance with the national arbitration law, unless it is an ICSID arbitration award.  Then there is a slightly different procedure.  Those awards that are not ICSID awards will usually fall under the New York Convention, which allows a member state or forum state to review the award for compatibility with public policy or public order.  That is, however, only a very limited defence and one that is rarely successful.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, if it concerns an ICSID award then there is no review at all for the national court that has to recognise and enforce, which is the terminology lawyers would use in that case.

As to what happens when one takes the award, in the Belgian procedure, it goes to the foreign minister, who gives it to the clerk of the court of appeal, who rubber stamps it and that is it.

Under the CETA text, for example, it says that they may consider public law.  I suppose the concern, and perhaps Dr. de Boeck can confirm this, is that the ECJ does not have pre-eminence from the perspective of the ECT.  It is just something that it may consider and bear in mind but the ECJ ruling does not have a binding case.  As I understand, in the case of the Achmea ruling, which was a kind of parallel, again, it was determined that intra-EU cases were not compatible with EU law.  I believe two or three of the different arbitration panels have chosen to ignore that ruling and have chosen to meet.  That is really one piece.

I commend the committee on its focus on child poverty.<\/p> <p>  The Children's Rights Alliance unites more than 135 members.  Our goal is to make Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child.  In my opening remarks, I want to touch on several areas.  These are the need for national co-ordination and implementation, as well as some specific recommendations in areas where the committee's attention could make a real difference.  This is not to say there are not other areas affected by child poverty.  I want to point towards some important headline issues in my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  With regard to national co-ordination and implementation, I am reminded of the importance of Tony Blair.  Committee members might remember that in 1999 he famously committed to ending child poverty in the UK by 2020.  He enacted a Child Poverty Act, invested in school meals and set up an early years programme called Sure Start.  One of the reasons his Government had success and lifted more than 1 million children out of our measure of consistent poverty was that it established a child poverty unit in Whitehall.  This was very important for driving change.  In the Irish context, we do not have a comparable cross-government child poverty unit.  Excellent work is being done on child poverty across the board in the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Social Protection and Education but there is no single child poverty unit.  Such units are being established in other countries with national action plans on child poverty.  New Zealand and Scotland are good examples.  The Children's Rights Alliance believes it is important to establish such a unit, to be co-located between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It could be an important driving force behind actions to address child poverty.<\/p> <p>  We need a national action plan to address child poverty.  We know the Government plans to look at this area, particularly in the context of a new national policy framework for children and young people.  The Government should also think about local child poverty action plans.  These could be introduced on a phased basis.  This could involve local needs analysis, facilitating children and young people in this work and funding the implementation of these plans.  We think that could really work in the Irish context.<\/p> <p>  As for areas that deserve special attention, I am here today with representatives from Early Childhood Ireland and SPARK.  The data tell us that one of the most important areas to invest in to address child poverty is that of childcare.  The Government needs to think about providing free, or nearly free, access to childcare for families on the lowest incomes.  One way to make this happen is that they receive higher levels of subsidisation under the national childcare scheme.  The Government should establish a cross-government working group to ensure childcare is available to low-income families wishing to attend education and training.<\/p> <p>  I know committee members are particularly interested in food poverty.  This is particularly acute in Ireland because of the high cost of food due to the fact we are on the edge of Europe.  The Government has an excellent hot school meals programme.  This programme needs to be rolled out throughout the country in order that all children and young people get to benefit.  It should go much further and include non-formal education settings and early year settings.<\/p> <p>  I want to bring the attention of the committee to areas that are often forgotten, namely, those of play, recreation, sports, arts and cultural activities.  European policy in this regard is that these areas need to be considered when trying to address child poverty.  There is a real need to focus on these areas.  Local development plans should be proofed against child poverty.  Investment should be made in walkable communities and in play and recreation facilities.<\/p><p>Investment in the arts, cultural events and sports is also critical to the development of children and young people.  We know that it changes their horizons.  It makes them feel like another world is possible and is particularly important for children living in persistent poverty.<\/p><p> That is my opening statement.  I would be happy to answer questions about any other areas in which the committee or the Chair might be interested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Ward.

My main focus will be on the national childcare scheme.  We also wish to bring to the attention to the committee an important issue which we believe is burgeoning and which will have a particular potential effect on disadvantaged children.<\/p> <p>  As the leading support organisation in our sector, Early Childhood Ireland welcomed the national childcare scheme from the beginning.  We see it as a mechanism through which our system of childcare can be transformed to meet the needs of all young children and their families.  The scheme has been described as Ireland's pathway to quality, accessible, affordable early learning and care and school-aged childcare.  As members will know, it was intended that the previous childcare programmes would be replaced with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The scheme's objectives, to improve outcomes for children and support lifelong learning, to reduce poverty, to facilitate labour market activation and to reduce the cost of childcare, are worthy.  As the committee will be aware, however, the intention to bring the previous schemes under the national childcare scheme, NCS, was reversed, meaning that in some families there are children with different subsidies from one another, even though the family circumstances may have remained unchanged and the family may be in disadvantage.  This is highly regrettable but, in hindsight, seems inevitable.  While the policy objectives of the scheme are not dissimilar to such schemes in other jurisdictions, they are very challenging given their somewhat contradictory nature.  There is in place a work-study test and a sponsorship system which, although improved in the recent budget, remains unwieldy for families and childcare providers.  As members of the committee will know, it has left some families with reduced subsidies.  We suggest that the Government needs to prioritise the poverty reduction objective, especially at a time when it intends increasing investment, which is very welcome.  This would help the most disadvantaged families and meet the wider objective to reduce overall child poverty levels in Ireland.  The mechanics of how this would work would need to be agreed but we hope that the review of the national childcare scheme will address this issue.<\/p> <p>  The second issue we wish to bring to the committee's attention is that, as many committee members will know, we operate a national information service for childcare providers for our members, and in the past few weeks, particularly since the sector reopened for the fresh 2021-22 year, we have heard of increasing numbers of baby room closures.  We are monitoring this very carefully as we are concerned that there is a hidden crisis burgeoning in our sector.  Our belief is that this is happening now as the Government winds back the employment wage subsidy scheme and providers are facing difficult economic decisions which were postponed by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The closures themselves are of concern but this is also a key capacity metric about which no data are being collected.  The issue of closures impacts every family but if we are facing into decreasing provision for very young children, that will have a particular effect on those who are disadvantaged.  They may have a sponsorship agreement but not be able to find a place in an early years setting, thus reducing access to important early intervention for children.  Early Childhood Ireland asks members of the committee to request that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth begin immediately to gather data on room closures in real time and to use those data to develop a robust policy response in order that all families, especially those who are disadvantaged, may have access to quality early years care and education.<\/p> <p>  I hope I have not run over my time.

SPARK is a peer-led advocacy and support group for lone parents.  We offer unique insights into the lived reality of parenting alone.  I am Louise Bayliss, co-founder and spokesperson, and Gayle Smith is on our steering committee.  She is currently undertaking a master's in rights and social policy.  Ms Smith can speak about deficiencies in the national childcare scheme which mean she currently pays over 25% of her income on childcare.  She is undertaking her master's despite the barriers rather than because of the supports.<\/p> <p>  Eliminating child poverty is a key ambition of SPARK.  We believe that in order to achieve this, we need honest discussions about child poverty.  Children are the age group most likely to experience poverty in Ireland.  The rate of consistent poverty among children stood at 8.1% in 2019 compared with 5.1% for adults aged 18 to 64 and 2.3% for those over the age of 65.  Poverty among children, however, has very different patterns.  Children in two-parent families have a consistent poverty rate of 6.1%, whereas children in lone-parent households have a consistent poverty rate of 17.1%.  The overall figure masks where child poverty is sited.  Without examining these data, real solutions cannot be found.<\/p> <p>  There have been many reports examining what is needed to lift lone-parent households and our children out of poverty.  The results are consistent.  We need four things: affordable housing; quality, affordable childcare; well-paid, family-friendly jobs; and enforced child maintenance.  Currently, though, lone parents are at the harsh end of the housing crisis, and our children are the most likely to end up homeless or in inadequate housing.  The replacement of targeted childcare schemes by the NCS has had a detrimental impact on some lone parents.  The minimum wage is below a living wage and, because of childcare costs, many lone parents opt to work in low-paid jobs that can be accessed around school hours.  We are one of the few OECD countries that does not have a statutory maintenance system.  Many parents are forced to go to court for a child maintenance order.  Once the order is issued, there is no oversight as to whether the order is complied with and the lone parent is obliged to follow up on enforcement or, as in many cases, forfeit the payment.  This poor maintenance system is compounded by social welfare rules which mean that lone parents lose the support of the liable relatives unit when the youngest child turns seven.  Our housing disregard was set in 1997 and, therefore, is in no way reflective of current housing costs.<\/p> <p>  Those are the overall concerns we have about child poverty.  However, if time permits during the session, we would like to discuss three specific social welfare measures.  First, lone parents living in independent households are not entitled to the living alone allowance, household benefits package or free travel.  This means in real terms that the increase in the qualified child rate is a net payment of &euro;7.42 for under-12s or &euro;15.42 for over-12s.  This explains why lone-parent households on social welfare face greater poverty than many other social welfare households.  Second is the cliff-edge drop in payment when a parent moves to the working family payment when their youngest child turns 14.  We welcomed the report commissioned on the impact of the loss of the jobseeker's transitional payment, JST, last year; however, we were disappointed that it looked only at JST claimants moving to jobseeker payments and did not examine the working family payment.  Our interactive calculator, which we have submitted along with our written statement, shows clearly the loss of income.  For example, a lone parent working full-time on a net income of &euro;500 will lose over &euro;70 a week when their youngest child turns 14, this despite the fact that teenagers are proven to be more expensive.  Third, the social welfare assessment of mortgage payments paid by the non-resident parent increases the risk of homelessness, even in cases of domestic violence.<\/p> <p>  If we want to reduce child poverty, targeted supports must be directed to lone-parent households.  We need the best interest of the child to be central to all Government policies.  Therefore, we support the Focus Ireland campaign to end child homelessness.  In two days' time, the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence begins.  Not all lone parents are victims of domestic violence, but all parent survivors of gender-based violence become lone parents.  A key solution to ending gender-based violence, GBV, is to offer parents real options to leave abusers.  For many economically dependent parents, exiting abuse leads to poverty and homelessness, which cannot be tolerated as realistic options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bayliss.

First, I would like to pick up on the point relating to child maintenance.  My office has been drafting child maintenance legislation for four or five years now.  It will be taken on by the women's caucus and will hopefully be tabled early in the new year.  In that context, could the witnesses speak a bit about how a guaranteed State payment of child maintenance would make a difference in addressing child poverty and act as an anti-child poverty tool?<\/p> <p>  My second question is to Ms Bayliss.  Has she, through SPARK, encountered instances involving women where the non-resident parent either ended up in prison or deceased?  Obviously, there are no protections in any legislation for unmarried parents.  If they were married, there would be a widow&rsquo;s pension.  There is no State support for a child who is left fatherless because of either detention or death.<\/p> <p>  Could Ms Bayliss also comment some more on part-time study?  Obviously, we keep pushing women towards low-paid employment under the one-parent family system.  We would be better off supporting and resourcing women to engage with education, whatever type of education it is, whether it is pursued on a part-time basis, at weekends, in the evenings or whatever.  However, we do not seem to recognise anything other than full-time higher education when it comes to the likes of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, supports.  Could Ms Bayliss comment on how we need to address policy in that area in order that women can be encouraged towards education and can eventually access jobs that are not low paid?  The latter would increase their chances of removing themselves out of poverty.  As we all know, being in a job does not mean that a person is not living in poverty.

First, child maintenance is hugely problematic area.  Ireland is one of the few countries that does not have a child maintenance system.  This impacts on child poverty.  Coupled with that is how child maintenance is assessed.  There is no point in having a child maintenance system if the Department of Social Protection assesses it as means to reduce its social welfare bill, rather than directing the maintenance to the child.  That is hugely problematic.  In this country, it is even worse in than most of the countries with statutory systems.  As the Senator will be aware, once there is a court order in place for maintenance to be paid, the Department of Social Protection will deduct that from a social welfare payment, whether it is paid or not.  That is a huge barrier to young parents who are looking for maintenance in the courts.  The second barrier to looking for maintenance is that there is no enforcement of payments.  It is up to the lone parent to go backwards and forwards to court in that regard, which is demoralising and humiliating.<\/p> <p>  Linked to that was the Senator&rsquo;s question about supports where a second parent is not present, either through detention or death.  In current circumstances, two incomes are needed to sustain a child.  When a couple are not together, there is an obligation on the other parent pay maintenance.  Unfortunately, we do not enforce this in Ireland.  In the case of death or detention, there is no other parent to pay it.  There need to be additional supports in place in order to ensure that every child has that benefit.  It is the key way of lifting children out of poverty, as I said, once the social welfare rules focus around them.<\/p> <p>  The Senator&rsquo;s final question, which is relevant, was about why we support part-time work for lone parents and acknowledge their care responsibilities, but do not do it for higher education.  I would like my colleague, Ms Smith, to speak about that.  She has lived experience of this because she is going through it at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for letting us speak today.  Obviously, unlike the other speakers, I am not a professional.  What I do bring is my lived experience as a lone parent, as well as that of having gone through returning to education as a mature student.<\/p> <p>  From the time I decided to return to education, I found that there were many barriers.  The first was, as Senator Ruane has said already, that I was not given a choice to go part time.  I had to go full time, because you do not get a SUSI grant if you go part time.  While this can be this can be fine for many parents, for others it is not an option.  If they have a couple of kids who they need to look after, or if their kids are really young, it is not an option for them to go full time.  If you do go full time, you will incur extra childcare costs.  When education is spread over two years, you have take that into account and ask yourself how long you will be in education.  That is the way I had to look at it.  When I returned to education, I was on rent supplement.  You cannot be in full-time education and receive rent supplements.  I had to move from rent supplements to the housing assistance payment, HAP, which meant I was financially worse off as a result.  I felt that when I went back to education there was barrier upon barrier in front of me.  It is only because I was so stubborn and dogmatic about it that I got through.  Many women, because of their circumstances, are so worn down that they do not have the capacity,or the fight left in them to get through this.  That needs to be understood.<\/p> <p>  Nobody wants to live in poverty, and nobody wants their children to live in poverty.  If women are given supports to return to education and to return to work, this will bring long term benefits that can break this intergenerational cycle of child poverty.  The Government should look at short-term supports for women that will help them in the long term.  I am doing my masters degree.  Let me put this in perspective.  I did not pass my leaving certificate.  I did an undergraduate degree and now I am doing my masters.  I am going to finish with first-class honours.  Next year, I will be free from social welfare dependency.  That is the aim.  The Government should look at short term fixes like this.  If someone wants to return to education, the Government should say &ldquo;Okay, great, how we help you?  How can we support you?  How can we make this happen?&rdquo;  It should not be a constant fight for people who are already struggling.  When children see their parents going to education and getting a good job, that is inspiring for them.  We really need to consider that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Gayle Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Smith for sharing that story.

They are great to hear.  More power to her.  As she said, however, it was stubbornness that got her there.  The default should not be stubbornness to be successful.  It should just be there for her.<\/p> <p>  My first question is to the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  I was interested in their concept of the localised childhood poverty plan.  As someone who worked on it with a revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID, co-ordinator years ago, I see how looking at an area in its unique self works to improve the lives of people.  I would like to know more detail about that concept.  How would they see that being rolled out?<\/p><p>It is a good idea.  From listening to one of the speakers, perhaps our committee can write to the Department and ask to find out about those increasing baby-boom numbers.  It is an important aspect.  As I said, we are putting up barriers to people entering education, re-entering education and entering into work.  If we have no one to mind our babies, then there is another block, never mind the cost, which is an issue we are all working on constantly.<\/p><p> To ask a general question as well, how do the witnesses feel about individualisation in the context of looking at supports?  I dare not say benefits, because they are not.  We are examining supports to get families to a better standard of living.  In that regard, I point to the inflexibility of all our systems, their inability to work together and the siloing of educational grants, as Ms Smith rightly said.  She was not entitled to a SUSI grant because she was not going to education full-time.  How far away are we from individualisation in respect of looking at the individual to enable supports to work best for the person concerned, because the circumstances of every family and every individual are different?  I would like hear the witnesses' opinions on those aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#C00700","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I will start with Ms Ward.

The local child poverty development plan has come from talking to our members about what kind of issues are being experienced on the ground, as the Senator said.  A good example of that is the Childhood Development Initiative, CDI, in Tallaght, which has done a needs assessment regarding children living in poverty.  It looked at what is happening for children in our location.  Several things emerged from that undertaking.  Basically, it was discovered that people living in Tallaght had what was almost the biggest gap in educational attainment in the country.  That was one of the points that jumped out from the findings.  It was also found, however, that while there were many green spaces for children, all the playgrounds and play areas were in bad condition.  The schools in the area said they just did not have enough resources in respect of technology, schoolbooks, etc.  It can be imagined, then, if we had this national local approach to addressing child poverty, that here is an area where the local stakeholders have already done an analysis of what the needs are.  If they put a plan together and the Government provided funding to address some of those issues, then we can imagine some of the change that would bring about.  Adopting this approach in future, and perhaps piloting it in some areas to see what the impacts would be and how much it would cost if it is going to be employed, could make a major difference.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of individualisation, possibly what is at the heart of this matter is the lack of focus on child poverty and the poverty of the parents.  I say that because these systems are all developed by different Departments with their own objectives and goals.  If they came together with a different goal, however, the systems might be developed in a different way.  We already heard from Ms Smith about how important third-level and further education is.  She knows the difference that would make to her child&rsquo;s life, but she has faced all these challenges and difficulties in pursuing her goal.  The data already tell us this.  If Professor Mary Daly, who studied at Oxford University, was presenting here before the committee, she would tell the members that the single most effective measure to lift children out of poverty is actually the provision of quality childcare and education and training opportunities to the mother.  If that is what the data are telling us, then what is it not happening?  There should be no barriers in this regard.  If someone like Ms Smith wants to get going on her career, then she needs supports such as childcare, grants and flexibility.  She should not have any of those challenges to deal with.  Therefore, we must re-examine the overarching policy that is guiding some of these systems and the delivery in that context, and a child poverty frame is the best way to do that<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I must leave for a Seanad vote, but I will be listening to the responses on my phone.

I hope that Senator McGreehan can hear me thanking her.  It would be welcome if the committee would take on this issue.  It may not look like a direct child poverty issue, but what concerns us, as I tried to make clear in our opening statement, is that we will have a situation from next September, potentially, and nobody is monitoring this, where families will have sponsorship agreements in place.  As committee members and colleagues from the other organisations will be aware, that is not necessarily a straightforward thing.  While those families will have sponsorship agreements, we are concerned that they may not be able to get a place.  That impacts all children from all backgrounds, but obviously if these sponsorships are being given by Tusla, or whatever organisation or agency, to families because of disadvantage and if no are places available, then that obviously has an immediate as well as a long-term impact on the children concerned and their families.  Therefore, the support of the committee in this regard would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  All kinds of statistics and facts are collected weekly by Pobal on behalf of the Department concerning attendance and all kinds of things in a similar vein, and all we are asking is that providers would have a way of reporting in when they have decided to close a room.  Sometimes those decisions have a positive impact.  It may mean more room for toddlers, for example.  However, we are concerned because no one is overseeing or monitoring that aspect and we do not have the same kind of planning for places in Ireland as exists in other areas.  We have noted an increase in providers telling us that they are making these decisions, and they are making them for economic reasons.  Therefore, this is not about blaming providers whatsoever.  All we are saying is that if somebody was tracking that information and if the Department could then come up with a response, that would be welcome.<\/p> <p>  I know Senator McGreehan did aim this point at us, but on the question of individualisation, I completely agree with Ms Ward.  We would describe it as a holistic approach.  It is a different term, but we are talking about the same thing.  We see it every day.  This is part of quality care and education.  It involves considering the whole picture of children and their families and the system needs to do that as well.  Again, other countries get this aspect right, where it is seen that family support and quality childcare is required by some families more than others.  Much of the time, the systems in place in those countries spark into action when a woman is pregnant and not after the child is born.  There is no reason, given proper planning and investment, that we could not do the same.  I completely agree that this issue should be seen through a child poverty lens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I remind the witnesses to indicate if they wish to contribute a response to any questions.

I congratulate Ms Smith on her wonderful achievement as well.  It is great to hear about, and I appreciate her sharing her personal story as well.  It is powerful for all of us.<\/p> <p>  I also want to focus on the issue of childcare.  Ms Ward put it strongly in respect of saying that the single most important metric or measure that can be adopted to bring children out of poverty is to have a quality system of childcare.  We are grappling with how we can go about doing that.  We heard from all the witnesses in this regard, and as Ms Byrne said, the national childcare scheme was supposed to offer a pathway to a Scandinavian model of childcare.  The flaws in it, however, as identified by Ms Bayliss and Ms Smith, and by others, and highlighted by my colleague, Senator Sherlock, have really undermined its effectiveness and have made it counterproductive in many ways.  We see siblings from the same family having different measures of support, etc.  <\/p> <p>  What I want to do is to ask the witnesses about their view on the funding model the Government is proposing.  We in the Labour Party have been putting forward the idea of a universal public childcare scheme, and the Government is moving in that direction too.  The Minister recently spoke in the budget about moving to a new funding model in September.  We are starting from a situation where childcare provision has a heavy reliance on private providers and the overall system is piecemeal, fragmented and complex to navigate, as the witnesses described.<\/p><p>How do we get to the point of a universal public childcare system?  Is there a system that does what we are considering?  I recently looked at Berlin childcare models, which are very interesting in that they are community run but State funded.  Ms Byrne and I have discussed how we can get to the point where there would be still local engagement and local governance of childcare but also State funding.  I have called for a Donogh O'Malley moment such as what was done in the case of secondary education, whereby every child would be guaranteed a childcare place that the State would pay for but that would be provided locally.  I would love to hear any ideas or thoughts our guests may have from their work and experience as to how we can get to that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#D00800","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, childcare is critical, not only for helping parents access the workplace but also because it is the great equaliser.  The large meta-studies tell us they can predict whether a child will progress to further education based on their social and emotional skills at the age of three, particularly in the case of boys.  That is not always the case, but the studies tell us we need to get this part right.<\/p> <p>  The Labour Party supports a public childcare model and the funding model recommendations may push us in that direction.  A few issues arise in this regard, one of which is that most countries in Europe have a public childcare model, not a for-profit-led system.  In Ireland and the UK, we do have a for-profit-led system because of the gap whereby our governments did not establish a childcare system, as happened in other countries.  The data generally tell us those not-for-profit approaches deliver better outcomes for children.<\/p> <p>  The question is what we should do when it comes to the Irish model and how we can get the best outcome model that other European countries have.  Norway is a good example to follow in this area.  It had a for-profit-led system and transitioned to a public childcare model.  It developed a national scheme and services could opt in or out.  Over time, services opted in, but one of the conditions of being part of that system was it was a not-for-profit model.  That is something to think about.  As I understand it, what the Government is recommending will be an opt-in scheme as well.  It will be interesting to see how it is managed.  I understand the Government will try to control the market costs through particular measures and not require choosing between for-profit or not-for-profit.  It will be interesting to see how that plays out.  Perhaps the same outcome can be achieved.  It will be important to examine.<\/p> <p>  There is a need to have a discussion about the for-profit and the not-for-profit models.  There is fantastic practice and great outcomes from many different providers, but one issue we sometimes hear about from members relates to the costs it takes to be a provider and run a local centre.  The larger entities are able to do it because they are larger and can consolidate their costs, whereas the smaller programmes find it much more difficult.  I would imagine that, in a move towards a national programme, we will probably need higher levels of subsidisation for some of the smaller centres to keep them open.  I suspect we may need to deal with the issue of for-profit and not-for-profit.<\/p> <p>  In the area of direct provision, obviously, the country is moving towards a not-for-profit model.  There is a long lead-in time and a new programme is coming, but providers are adapting.  They are becoming social enterprises and changing their models.  There have been other examples in Ireland, therefore, where there has been a move from a for-profit to a not-for-profit model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":392,"content":"<p>There was a lot in Deputy Bacik's question.  There is a touch of the old joke \"if I was going to Dingle, I would not start from here\" about this.  It is a major challenge for whatever Government in power, including the current one, and for the officials.  As the Deputy described, the system is fragmented and piecemeal, even in regard to the language we use and our shared understanding.  For example, we may talk about for-profit and not-for-profit, but the backbone of the sector comprises between 1,000 and 1,200 settings that are ECCE only.  No fees come in.  They are owned by private individuals in the sense we all know them, that is, we all have such people in our housing estates throughout the country.  They are in private hands but they do not take in fees and therefore make a profit in the way we understand other businesses operate.  That core group is 100% funded by the State, given ECCE is 100% funded.  There are also full day care providers and some ECCE preschools that offer after-school childcare, as well as those that offer stand-alone after-school.<\/p> <p>  It is quite complex and diverse and that is a challenge.  The vast majority of providers are private and their heckles go up when they hear mention of profit because they will ask, very directly, what profit we are referring to because they are not making money.  Many of them have been around for 30 or more years.  They have set up a service and do not see themselves as a business.  It is really complicated.  Because of the way the system has been set up, there will need to be a conversation as this funding model goes forward about how we are going to tackle this challenge the Deputy and Ms Ward referred to.  It has become a privatised model but not necessarily a for-profit one, and it is important to say that.  Of course, there are, as Ms Ward described, shareholder-led chains but they are a tiny proportion, between 7% and 8%, of the 4,500.  We need to include the full diversity in the conversations and that is very challenging.  I do not think anyone would have wanted the industry to be this way, including an awful lot of the providers, which have to deal with a significant degree of administration, a lack of planning and everything else.<\/p> <p>  It is absolutely the case there are problems with the national childcare scheme, particularly for families living in poverty and families in pockets of either large cities or rural areas where a childcare place just cannot be found.  In such cases, if you find out you are expecting a baby, you will tell the cr&egrave;che provider before you tell your cousin because you want to get the baby's name down.  There are problems also with fees.  Providers, too, find the scheme very difficult to grapple with, even though the intention was to ease administration, which it has done.<\/p> <p>  The bones of the Scandinavian model are there and the funding model needs to be introduced thoughtfully, trying to address the myriad issues, which will be challenging.  Children must be at the centre of that and quality for children, regardless of the circumstances of their families, needs to be prioritised.  That is the great equaliser in the so-called Scandinavian and Nordic models we all admire so much.  In those countries, there is universal quality for children regardless of income, with all parents paying something unless they are destitute, and there are also some of the lowest levels of child poverty.  Those two things go hand in hand.  We all need to watch the new funding model carefully and closely - we understand the report will issue soon and go live next year - to ensure children will stay at the centre of it and that everybody who has been delivering childcare, including the 30,000 educators, will be included in that discussion, with their needs taken into consideration in the funding model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank our guests.

Unfortunately, child poverty is one of the biggest issues in my area, although I hope that will not always be the case.<\/p> <p>  My first question is directed at our guests from the Childrens Rights Alliance.  I had not been aware of the child poverty unit that was set up in Britain in 1999, so I carried out a little research on it.  Will our guests elaborate on it?  I understand the overall aim was to reduce child poverty and improve social justice, with a cross-departmental approach, which was welcome.<\/p><p>That seems to be an approach that is being asked for in an awful lot of briefs.  I am Sinn F&eacute;in's spokesperson on mental health and many people say there should be a cross-departmental approach to that area, and I agree.

What learnings can we take from the child poverty unity in Britain?  That is my first question.<\/p><p> My second question is for SPARK and I will put it to its representatives now, if that is okay with the Chair.  It was not in SPARK's opening statement but was in the supplementary document they provided on insecure housing and HAP tenancies.  It is a big issue.  Only last week, Focus Ireland had a report that said a high percentage of the rental units currently available are unaffordable for people, even when they have access to HAP.  Thus, I support in theory SPARK's call for HAP rates to be increased to keep them in line with the market rates.  However, that needs to be added on.  There needs to be a rent freeze at the same time.  Otherwise, the market will adapt and swallow up any increases in HAP and the residents will not see any benefits from it.  Will SPARK outline some of the challenges people are facing in insecure HAP tenancies, especially in the context of child poverty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#E00500","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I will go to Ms Bayliss first as she has her hand up and then I will bring Ms Ward in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#F00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Just going back to the last speaker's question, which I had my hand up for, and the issue of childcare and the provision of it, many lone parents face a gap in that the hours are usually between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.  Lone parents usually work in hospitality or retail meaning they are working evenings and weekends when there is no childcare available.  That is a major issue lone parents face and there is no subsidy towards the cost of the childcare.  For instance, I know for a fact that Ms Smith cannot avail of the national childcare scheme and must pay privately to have her child minded.  That is one issue I wanted to point out.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Ward's point, HAP is a huge issue for people in SPARK.  As the Deputy is probably aware, when people go onto homeless HAP their rent is calculated based on a social housing model for year 1.  In year 2, the rent can go up again but the HAP rate may not necessarily follow.  It has come down to a 2% increase annually now but it was at 4%.  Suddenly people were paying an additional 4% that the HAP was not meeting.  That has been going on and on cumulatively.  We have people who are in the same housing estate where one is paying a &euro;90 or &euro;100 top-up to his or her landlord out of a social welfare payment of &euro;240 and somebody else is paying the correct payment of the social housing assessment of 12% or 15% of their income, depending on the area they are living in.  That is causing huge difficulties for people.  They know that if they lose that home they will likely end up homeless so they struggle to pay these massive top-ups to the landlord that are not being met by HAP.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy's point that HAP and increasing HAP is not the solution.  However, in the short term, as a measure for families and the children we know are going hungry at night-time so their parents can pay the HAP top-ups, we are asking for HAP to be increased to match until we can bring the market in line and bring in the other measures the Deputy mentioned like rent freezes, capping of market rents and obviously ultimately, a social housing model that works and ensures our children are in safe, secure housing at affordable rents.  Until that time, the top-ups are really crucifying many of our families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I see Ms Smith also has her hand up.

There is also no allowance for, say, a lone parent with four kids.  He or she would probably be paying the same rent as a single person.

What happened in the UK was Tony Blair's Government introduced a Child Poverty Act.

What the unit did - it does not exist any more because the Tories did away with it - was bring together senior civil servants and researchers working across government to ensure different bits of government were introducing the kind of measures that needed to be introduced.  Funding programmes were run as well.  Things like poverty-proofing were also done.<\/p> <p>  We have talked a bit about the national childcare scheme.

What really strikes me at the moment when you look at the Government is that the talent is there across the Government.

There are over 200,000 children at risk of poverty in Ireland and more than 90,000 are in consistent poverty.  This means they do not have guaranteed access to sufficient food, shelter, healthcare and other essentials I think most of us take for granted.  Those are truly shocking figures.  The representatives' submissions and experiences are essential insights to help the committee understand and advocate for the change we urgently need.  If I have time, I have three questions for the Children's Rights Alliance and one for SPARK.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by Ms Ward's inclusion of the concept of childproofing local and national development plans to meet the needs of young people.  During the development of the county development plan for Cork County Council this year, we did a consultation with primary schools and transition years.  It was a really fascinating process.  It came about because we felt we did not hear enough from young people.  Politicians are contacted all the time and our constituency offices are always inundated but they are always from the older populations and of course we represent the younger population too.  For the most part, all the children wanted or were calling for was safe infrastructure to walk and cycle to school.  They were really sensible and reasonable requests.  There were some other very good ones like slides from the top of town into the sea and stuff like that.  I would love Ms Ward to elaborate on this concept of childproofing and how it can be achieved.  It is really important.<\/p> <p>  Secondly, we know the State spends 0.3% of GDP on early years, which is well below the European average of 0.8% and the UNICEF recommendation benchmark of 1%.  Ms Ward emphasised the need to provide free access to childcare for families on the lowest incomes through the national childcare scheme for families in receipt of a medical card.  Will she expand a bit more on the importance of this kind of measure?<\/p> <p>  Thirdly, she highlighted the acute nature of child poverty in Ireland, cited the school meals programme as being an important State response and rightly called for the programme to ensure all children have access to hot, nutritious meals daily in education settings.<\/p><p>My understanding is that this will have multiple benefits in terms of nutrition, participation in education and the behavioural impact.  Will the representatives elaborate a little more on the impact it could have?<\/p><p> Ms Bayliss highlighted the systematic and specific issues faced by single parent families, of which we are all aware.  She particularly highlighted issues around domestic abuse as we approach the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence and stated that the key solution to ending gender-based violence is to offer parents real options to leave abusers.  Currently, it can be even more difficult to leave existing abusive and violent situations because of the risk of poverty, homelessness and, often, as we have learned recently, loss of citizenship, which is often linked to a partner and makes it difficult to leave abusive situations.  Will Ms Bayliss suggest some actions we should put to the Departments of Social Protection and Housing, Local Government and Heritage to tackle these issues?<\/p><p> If I have asked too many questions, a written response is fine.  I am not sure if I have enough time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#F01000","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>We are okay for time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#G00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It is one of the key things that should be done.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing many countries across Europe start to do what are called child rights impact assessments.  These are checklists of different things that decision makers need to think about if they are trying to make sure that their service, or local plan of delivery, is in line with the interests and rights of children.  The way many companies, organisations or public authorities operate means that they are not necessarily making decisions that have the rights or best interests of children at their heart.  That means resources go in a different direction.  They do not go towards walkways, playgrounds, local facilities and so on that children might need in local areas.  We know that the Government is exploring and thinking about how this could work.  Again, it would be great to trial this on a pilot basis to get some local authorities to adopt this approach and see what recommendations and changes it could lead to.<\/p> <p>  What is interesting around the Covid piece is that Scotland did a similar analysis when it was devising its Covid restrictions.

As we know, there are great things about the national childcare scheme, but I do not think Ms Smith should have had to experience the issue with market costs at all.  If someone happens to live in a part of country where childcare is expensive, he or she will have to pay more.  Someone on a low income who is accessing the scheme should not have to worry about that.  The scheme should find a way to pay a higher subsidy to that person.<\/p> <p>  We have been talking to members of SPARK about the way to address this and they said that most of the people they work with have a medical card.  That can be used to unlock a higher level of subsidy that would work.  The medical card is used in a similar way in other child poverty areas.  The medical card rates have not increased in a very long time and that needs to be addressed, but using the medical card is a way to ensure that some of the families on the lowest incomes would not have to deal with the problem of cost.  That is something that could be dealt with early on before we move to a new funding model.  It is something the Government could implement very quickly.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted the Deputy picked up on the school meals piece.  We know that all the countries that have the best outcomes for children have hot school meals as part of the school day.  It exposes children to food that is very good for them, they are more likely to eat it if it is hot and it helps families who are struggling on the breadline on very low incomes.  These families are also trying to juggle work.  One of the things we saw when restrictions hit and schools closed, even in programmes in Ireland at present, was that families were in crisis around food.  This is an area that the Government needs to invest in. <\/p> <p>  What is amazing about it is that the pilot programmes that have already been run - the former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty, initiated this piece of work and it has been followed on by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, at the Department of Rural and Community Development - is that the data coming back from the schools is very interesting.  Staff in one school said that when children left to go to the dentist, they would previously never have come back for the rest of the day, but they came back and stayed for the full day to get the meals.  Children were eating vegetables for the first time because they had no access to them at home and their families might not even have cooking facilities.  Children were not cranky; they were in better form and all those things that happen.  When children are hungry, they find it very hard to learn and, emotionally, they find it very hard to navigate everyday life.  We know hot meal programmes really help children to learn and socialise.  It is one of those areas where there is a win-win and all children will benefit.  Everyone should benefit from these programmes in a very non-stigmatising way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Domestic abuse is one of the things we are really concerned about.  When we set up SPARK it was not an issue we thought would be so prevalent, but an awful lot of women approach us when they are in the midst of domestic abuse and violence and are looking at their options.  They ask us what the options are for the family home, social welfare and maintenance, which we go through with them.  They are always appalled because they believe they are more supported than they are when it comes down to it.  I was shocked one day when I spoke to a woman - I have told this story before - who said to me that it was a case of homelessness or hospitalisation for her.  She made the choice that two or three hospital visits a year were okay, if her children were not going into homelessness.  I do not believe that anybody thinks that is a realistic option.  When we hear the question \"Why doesn't she just leave him?\" that is the reason.  There are no real alternatives.  We know that the chances of ending up in homelessness are very high for somebody being abused.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that happened during the Covid pandemic that was very welcome was the enhanced rent supplement for victims of domestic violence.  That was a very positive move, which we welcomed.  It gives people an option.  However, during the same period, there was a High Court ruling that all mortgage payments are now fully assessed as maintenance.  That is contradictory because if someone is in a family home on which there is a mortgage, and even if the abuser has been barred from the house and there is a court order to pay maintenance, the Department of Social Protection will assess that full mortgage payment as maintenance that is going towards the children.  The family can be left with no money to live on.  We have heard of cases where people will forgo the mortgage being paid so that they can feed their children.  That is counter-intuitive because that family will eventually have their home repossessed, go into homeless accommodation and be on HAP, which will cost much more.  Very simple measures can be taken to support a family when family breakdown is happening to ensure that the mortgage is paid, but is not calculated as child maintenance leaving the family with nothing to live on.  There are very simple moves like that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Ruane spoke about her child maintenance Bill.  We believe that if such a Bill did not involve going back to court, it would also make a major difference.  When people get away from their abuser, they do not necessarily want to go onto a combative court system to argue for child maintenance.  It should be something that is taken through Revenue, where it assesses the payment that is paid directly to the parent, for all victims of abuse, but especially for families experiencing domestic abuse.<\/p> <p>  We are very concerned that when somebody escapes from an abuser, and this is again from lived experience in SPARK, there are two things that continue post separation - arguments about access and arguments about child maintenance - because these are the only two things that can be controlled.  If we had that taken out of the court system, and the best interests of the child considered in maintenance and access, it would make a major difference.  It would give people real options to leave abusers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bayliss for raising those issues.  Sometimes it is easy to not be aware of the structural barriers across Departments.  Not too long ago, the West Cork Women Against Domestic Violence Project brought to my attention that it was always the way that when somebody presented as homeless, they would go to the local community welfare officer.  With the increase in homelessness cases, that responsibility has now been transferred to the local authority and, therefore, the person has to go to the local authority.  For example, where I live in West Cork - and it is the same in many constituencies - there are no busses from many towns to the places these people must present to their community welfare officer.  In addition, local authority staff are not used to dealing with those situations.  They are not trained and they are not trauma informed, although we cannot expect them to be.  There are examples in some counties, for example, Clare, where there are trauma-informed multidisciplinary teams dealing with housing.  They have training in this regard to make sure that they are supporting people.  One hears stories of people turning up during a very difficult time.  They are trying to leave the house.  They may have children with them, they may have pets, they may have luggage and they might not have transport and then they are told to find their own emergency accommodation.  When they find somewhere, they might be told, &ldquo;No, actually, that is too expensive&rdquo;, even though it had been on the list.  There are all of these kinds of structural aspects.

The national childcare scheme does not preclude that, but very few cr&egrave;ches in Ireland - I can think of one - that are prepared to open later.<\/p> <p>  Childminding has not been regulated.  While families who use childminders are eligible to get subsidies, these childminders have to be regulated and registered.  That is all coming into law.  The last time we appeared before the committee we said that.  The former Minister and the current Minister and the officials are aware of this, not as a flaw, but as something lacking in the current national childcare scheme.  This needs to be addressed for people who are studying or working outside normal hours and, particularly, for families that are headed by a lone parent.

Ms Byrne referred to the different supports.  What plan do we have?  We need a plan.  What type of childcare centres should we have?  Should they be community-based centres, co-operatives, employer-led, co-location, or should some be managed through the local childcare committee?  It is important to consider that.  Communication is the key here.  We spoke about that earlier.<\/p> <p>  During the pandemic, the OECD noted that Covid-19 has harmed \"the health, and social and material wellbeing of children\" from the poorest families.  Area-based childhood programmes and targeted supports are a priority in the national development plan, NDP, which was launched recently.  What could be changed in the NDP where we could make a difference?<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has played a huge part for community supports, through fundraising and through different grants for food parcels and hampers.  People in the community are so good to fundraise for different causes.  We have the St. Clare's Hospitality Kitchen, which is a kitchen in Carlow.  It plays a huge role in helping families and children.  How do the witnesses feel about this?  The Government now needs to look at these supports.<\/p> <p>  Ms Smith referred to applying to the local authority for the housing assistance payment, HAP.  That is a big issue.  If someone works and exceeds the threshold, he or she can lose all of that payment.  We need to look at that.  There is no joined-up thinking.<\/p> <p>  Even yesterday, for example, the Minister for Social Protection announced additional hot school meals programmes.  Carlow only got one of those.  I know for a fact that children are leaving schools that do not have the hot school meals programme and they are being sent to schools that have the programme.  We need to address this so that all schools have a hot school meals programme, because it is affecting schools.  As well as this, parents may have no other choice but to send their children to a school where they will be fed and get their meal.  Across the board, we have learned from this meeting that we need to target schools.  They have a huge impact on children and their lives.  They should be fed there.  Every school in the country should have a hot school meals programme.<\/p> <p>  Christmas is coming now and it can be a hard time for families that do not have any money.  The children are seeing all the Christmas advertisements on the television.  I wonder how we can help.  What supports are needed?  As Ms Smith said, we need to provide supports.  While they might only be for the short term, we need supports and joined-up thinking.<\/p> <p>  There has been an increase in domestic violence during the pandemic.  While we have always had domestic violence, it increased during the lockdowns.  In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, there is no women&rsquo;s refuge in County Carlow.  We need to address that.

The Deputy hit the nail on the head.  Half of all children living in poverty are not in DEIS schools.  The majority of children living in poverty are in rural Ireland.  This is because incomes in rural areas are lower.  One of the things we really need to think about in the national and local approaches is the balance between urban and suburban areas and rural Ireland.  Children and young people are missing out on some of the national programmes that have been introduced.  It has definitely happened with regard to family support.  There are some great family support programmes under the area based childhood programme being managed by Tusla.  We have spoken about how this will need to be made mainstream.  Children outside urban centres need to be able to access these types of family support measures.<\/p> <p>  I would love to see a focus on the DEIS model.  It is a very important model for getting extra resources to areas in the country that need them.  Half of all children in poverty are not in DEIS schools.  Principals and teachers tell us that because there is no home-school liaison officer they are doing huge amounts of work late into the night trying to help families.  Perhaps families are experiencing homelessness and they are trying to find a house for them.  There are issues such as this.  A home-school liaison officer would be able to do this work for the teachers who can then focus on their day job.  They also say they do not have extra budgets for anything.  If a child arrives in dirty clothes, there is nothing there.  There are no extra uniforms.  They do not have an extra budget they might have if it was a DEIS school.  We need a more flexible approach to children living in communities where the DEIS programme does not exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Murnane O'Connor's recognition of the difficulties and complexities.  It is very important that elected representatives are aware of this.  One of the advantages of the Irish system is that people still live in their communities and witness it.  Speaking exclusively about childcare provision, there is a straightforward answer but it is not simple.  We remain the lowest investor in the OECD in early years.  There are very complex issues to be sorted out, of course, and I do not mean to be disrespectful to other countries or ourselves when I say this but other countries have shown us that it is not rocket science if we take the right approaches and prioritise children.  What attracts us all to the Scandinavian model is that it gets the balance between universal and targeted correct.<\/p> <p>  Early Childhood Ireland regrets some of the negativity about the national childcare scheme even though it is entirely understandable.  It does have the beginnings of the solutions to the problem.  We need buy-in throughout society, exactly as Ms Smith said.  Not to be cynical, and I know Ms Smith was not for one minute being cynical, but the children of today are paying for the pensions of tomorrow.  They are the taxpayers of tomorrow.  Everybody pays tax, whether they are disadvantaged or well off.  We need to have this buy-in.  This is what works in Scandinavian countries.  People know the safety net is there for everybody.  Childcare is important and seen as a part of it.  If all children are availing of it and all families are paying into it and benefitting from it then it is not controversial.  Here, we are stuck in the mindset of speaking about, quite understandably, means testing and disadvantage.  It is very hard to grapple with.  Other countries have solved these problems or are solving them. We need to look to them.<\/p> <p>  For Early Childhood Ireland the key piece is the combination of universal and targeted measures so that every child has rights and all of us collectively as a society invest in them.  For the children the Deputy described so eloquently, who from time to time or throughout their childhood need extra support, it must be there for them.

If so, I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#J00300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The maintenance review group is chaired by Judge Catherine Murphy.  We have all fed into it and we are very grateful that she is doing the review.  No country has a perfect system but there are countries that have better systems and at least they have a system.  We have no system.  We purely rely on the court and it is not the right area for it.<\/p> <p>  In Austria, New Zealand and many Nordic countries, the amount is assessed based on income revenue.  The state pays the maintenance and then recoups it from the debtor.  The parent is kept out of it completely.  New Zealand and Australia have a system based on the involvement of the parent.  This encourages greater parent-child contact.  If the non-custodial parent has the child for 100 days a year, which is most weekends, he or she pays reduced maintenance compared with a parent who walks away completely.  This is a very good system.  However, I will put a caveat here.  The only fear is that we would hate to think a child is being dragged away just to reduce the amount of maintenance.<\/p> <p>  Ms Byrne has made the strong point that we are in a childcare system that is piecemeal.  It was allowed to develop and we are on a long path to find something good.  In one sense we are at the opposite with maintenance because we have no maintenance.  We are at ground zero.  We are in a greenfield.  We can look at other countries that have gone through the system and made their mistakes.  I hope Judge Catherine Murphy's review will state we need a child maintenance system.  Then we can do proper research and take the good parts from other jurisdictions and use the mistakes made and lessons learned and have a very good system.  This is my hope.  We have spoken to Scotland, Northern Ireland and even Australia.  We have spoken to various jurisdictions.<\/p><p>None of them is perfect, but they are all better than what we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Okay.

The children are still with them and the agency is supporting those families and trying to keep them together.  Tusla is supporting those families financially to ensure the children do not go without.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of maintenance, as a peace commissioner, women often come to me to sign the court orders seeking that fathers be brought back into court because they are not paying the maintenance.  We must deal with this issue and, as was said, have some sort of a system where the maintenance support payments could be taken out directly, whether by Revenue or by whatever means.  Ultimately, this issue is all about the children and that is what it must be about.  It is not about scoring any goals against ex-partners or whatever.  It is about the children and ensuring they are cared for.  I thank the representatives of SPARK for all the work they and their organisation do with struggling lone parents and children.  Many children are struggling now.  I also refer to the work done by SPARK on domestic violence and with the women going through those exceptionally difficult times.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#K00600","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Keogan.  We are coming to the end of the questions.  I will give everybody the chance to make concluding remarks, if they wish.<\/p> <p>  I want to make some points first.  They are more observations than questions.  I was delighted to hear childminding being mentioned because it is true not everybody has a 9 to 5, Monday to Friday job.  Many lone parents who do not have such jobs fall into that category, and trying to access childminding or childcare is a constant battle or juggling act for many people.  It is frustrating we are still talking about this issue.  In so many ways, indeed, it is only now coming to the table.  Access to quality and affordable childcare is of course one of the key ways of getting out of poverty.  It is also excellent for children on so many levels, not just from an academic point of view concerning school readiness but socially and everything in that regard.  Kids tend to love going into cr&egrave;che, where they are in a positive cr&egrave;che environment.  Childcare, therefore, is excellent for children, but it also plays a key role in respect of removing people from poverty.  I feel we have been talking about this issue for a long time, but I hope there will be positive changes and that the new funding scheme will result in proper access.  There is an issue with capacity in this context, and that issue was touched on as well by the representatives of Early Childhood Ireland.  There are not many baby spaces.  That is not the only issue, and there are problems with capacity throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The other point I wish to make concerns housing and domestic violence.  I find that at times there is such a disconnect in this area.  I refer to when it is necessary for people experiencing domestic violence and who finally make that decision, which it is not easy to do, to try to leave the situation they are in and then they are met with a whole heap of forms.  The questions to be faced can include being asked to provide proof that no property is owned and similar queries.  It leaves me wondering how on earth that can be helpful to anybody.  Surely there is a way of dealing with these situations where that aspect does not have to be resolved immediately.  I say that because what I see all the time are cases where women just go back to those situations.  It is happening now especially, because it is so difficult to find a rental property, harder again to find a place that will accept housing assistance payment, HAP, and harder again then to find a place within the HAP limit.  A great number of barriers exist for people in those situations.<\/p> <p>  The point was made about the rent allowance payments during Covid-19 and this must be examined.  We had representatives from Focus Ireland in with us two or three weeks ago speaking about this same issue of child poverty.  There are situations where the perpetrators of domestic violence are staying in homes.  I understand that in the short term it is necessary for women and children to leave the home, but it does seem unfair that perhaps two or three years later they are the ones getting HAP on a housing waiting list while the perpetrator is sitting in a three-bedroom property.  It is not always popular when I say that, but it is an aspect I feel strongly about.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of maintenance support, the other thing many people also do not realise is that maintenance payments only date from when people go into court to apply for it.  There is no backdating in that regard.  Again, and especially in the context of domestic violence, the last thing somebody coming out of that kind of situation needs to face, given how much they already have to deal with, is a requirement to face the perpetrator and seek child maintenance.  Yet, there is no backdating in the system.  That is another issue I wish to highlight.<\/p> <p>  We support many of the points made in the opening statements and in the answers given to the members of the committee.  I thank the witnesses not just for coming in today but for their work.  We are glad to be able to have this topic on the agenda.  We realise the important work all the witnesses and their organisations are doing, constantly trying to struggle and juggle on small budgets to highlight these issues.  That does not go unnoticed and certainly not by this committee.<\/p> <p>  If the witnesses would like to make any closing remarks or to add anything before we finish, I invite them to do so now.  We will start with Ms Ward and then move around all the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#K00700","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

If we can support the committee in any way in future, we will be delighted to do so.  One thing mentioned by one of the members concerned the EU child guarantee.  Something the committee might think about in future is keeping an eye on the implementation of that measure.  The Government will be submitting an action plan to enable it to draw down funds from the European Social Fund, ESF, at 5%.  That provides an opportunity for the whole of Government to do many different things to try to address the issues faced by our most vulnerable children.  To date, the Irish Government has been the most active and present in the EU discussions in this area and it is brilliant to see that.  If the committee were to focus on the ongoing implementation of the Government&rsquo;s work in this area, that could make a big difference in encouraging Departments across the board to allocate funds to run initiatives to help the most vulnerable children in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021112300002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ward.

When talking about this issue, it is a disgrace when we think that 17.1% of children in lone parent families are living in poverty.  We must address this situation urgently.  We hear the headline rate of 8.8% of children living in poverty, but what we should really be doing is drilling down into that figure and stating that 17% of children in lone parent families are living in poverty.  That is where poverty is situated and that is where we need the targeted supports to go.

However, freagra&iacute; as Gaeilge are, obviously, desired and more than welcome.  I have missed some because I was out at the doctor's.  Dr. Hyland was here last week and we discussed the issue of this change that is proposed to the leaving certificate.  Dr. Hyland explained that all 12 organisations involved with the Irish language were not in favour of what was being proposed, and many of us would share those concerns.  One of the difficulties is that when things are very segregated, disadvantage may then be recreated.  That is one of the concerns that was highlighted by one of our guests last week.<\/p><p> Not only is there siloing between different Departments when it comes to education, but also within education itself.  The NCCA is doing one thing, we are doing another, and the Department is doing another.  This is in addition to the programme for Government commitment to a citizens' assembly.  Should we be waiting until some of those processes are complete before making any decision about the leaving certificate in the context of the Irish language, when we may be changing the leaving certificate overall following our report, the citizens' assembly or different recommendations?  We still have not seen a draft of the NCCA report on leaving certificate reform, which the Chair raised last week, and yet there is this separate activity going on to reform Irish language.  It seems strange that the two would be separate.  That is my main question and I thank witnesses for coming in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021112300002#K00500","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I propose that Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh take the Chair as I have a vote on the agriculture committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021112300002#L00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021112300002#L00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637625600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Deputy Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Maidir le hathbhreithni&uacute; at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar an ardteist ina ioml&aacute;ine, tuigimid &eacute; sin agus feicimid &eacute; sin.

Language and communication skills were mentioned as being extremely important and reference was made to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, the CEFR.  How do we ensure students doing the leaving certificate have that capability to speak fluently?  I say this because I studied French and Irish at leaving certificate, with French at pass level, and I went on and studied it at degree level in Galway.  I was very fortunate to be able to go on Erasmus and spend a year abroad when I was young.  I did not have the chance to get to the Gaeltacht, unfortunately, despite being from Galway.  How do we ensure our children and students are left with that capability?  It is very difficult to become fluent.  I only know this from French.  I am doing the Gaeilge classes here in the Oireachtas so I hope I increase my level of fluency as Gaeilge as well.  It is nearly like having a bath.  It took six months when I was abroad before I had the ear and was able to speak.  How can we improve that to reach the CEFR so our students can leave school with the ear as Gaeilge?  Perhaps this happens more now that we have Gaelscoileanna at primary and secondary level but how do we do it for other schools as well?  How do we make sure all our schools are able to provide that?<\/p> <p>  I liked the idea of the subject on sa&iacute;ocht agus litr&iacute;ocht na Gaeilge that Ms U&iacute; Uiginn mentioned, which would teach Irish culture, heritage and literature.  It is absolutely great and wonderful.  I am guessing it would be tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  This particular subject would be of immense interest, particularly to a lot of our newer students.  I am referring to people who have arrived from abroad and settled in Ireland and are now coming into our schools.  I am sure Ms U&iacute; Uiginn is seeing more and more first generation Irish at primary and secondary level.  Would this also be available to them?  Would it only be tr&iacute; Ghaeilge?  I am just curious.  I am just putting it out there because it is something that would be of immense interest to so many.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021112300002#M01100","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Maidir le c&eacute;n chaoi an fr&aacute;ma tagartha a cheangal isteach chun &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os &eacute;ifeachta&iacute;, an ch&eacute;ad rud gur g&aacute; leis n&aacute; ail&iacute;ni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh idir na gr&aacute;id &eacute;ags&uacute;la sa fhr&aacute;ma tagartha agus an curaclam.

I welcome Dr. Martina Moloney, chair designate of the Heritage Council; and Ms Virginia Teehan, chief executive officer of the council.  Members have been provided with the opening statement furnished by the Heritage Council.<\/p> <p>  Standing Order 96 provides that the committee has the power to require that the chairperson designate of a body or agency under the aegis of the Department shall, prior to his or her appointment, attend before the committee to discuss his or her strategic priorities for the role.  Today's meeting, while we are looking more broadly at activities of the council and heritage in general, will be considered to have discharged that requirement under Standing Orders.<\/p> <p>   I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses and members attending today's meeting, whether in person or remotely within the Leinster House complex, are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Those participating in today's meeting are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to the proceedings.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure that privilege is not abused.  If I am of the opinion that any statement is potentially defamatory or an identified person or entity, the member or witness making the statement will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Dr. Moloney and Ms Teehan.  The committee has noted that heritage is now a significant part of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We have not had the opportunity as yet to address heritage matters, although a number of members have emphasised how important they are.  We do consider heritage to be very important.  When we lose heritage, whether it is architectural, cultural or natural heritage, it is gone and it is very hard to get back.  That is why it is so important that we acknowledge what we have and take whatever steps we can to preserve and conserve it for future generations.  The heritage of a town, place, country or region connects generations together.  It builds communities and fosters civic pride in an area when heritage is known.  It is very important to us.  It is just that our committee has been absolutely overrun with housing and planning issues and water-related issues.  I am delighted we are getting an opportunity to address heritage today.<\/p> <p>  I invite Dr. Moloney to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present before it on my nomination by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, as chair designate of the Heritage Council.  I was appointed as an ordinary member of the council through the Public Appointments Service process on 2 November 2020.<\/p><p>I am privileged to have been selected as chair designate and I confirm my commitment to this important role.  <\/p><p> I was a career official in Irish local government for 37 years, with more than 20 years in senior management roles.  I was county manager in Louth County Council for four years and county manager in Galway County Council for seven years until my retirement in 2014.  This role covered a vast array of activities to advance the economic, social and cultural development of the counties involved.  I hold a BA and an MA in public management and a doctorate in governance.  I am an experienced non-executive director of several State agencies, charities and companies limited by guarantee.  I currently sit on the boards of the Arts Council, the Heritage Council and Jigsaw, the youth mental health organisation.  I have previously been a member of the boards of Eirgrid, the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, and the Galway International Arts Festival.  I am familiar with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the charities governance code, including the role of chairperson, council members' code of conduct and ethics in public office.  I have served on audit and risk committees and committees dealing with finance and governance.<\/p><p> I am passionate about the valuable contribution of heritage to society.  I have engaged with heritage in both professional and personal capacities over many years.  I served as a member of the board of the Heritage Council from 2005 to 2010 and again for the last year.  Through my career in local government, I interacted with the heritage sector.  I was instrumental in negotiating the employment of the first heritage officer in Galway City Council in association with the Heritage Council.  As county manager, I oversaw the development and delivery of heritage services in counties Louth and Galway.  I engaged with many dedicated community volunteers who work tirelessly to protect and celebrate their local heritage.  I served as chair of the Irish Walled Towns Network for four years from 2017 to 2019 and as treasurer of the BurrenBeo Trust, a landscape charity from 2016 to September 2021.<\/p><p> The Heritage Council is charged with an important role under the Heritage Act 1995, including promoting policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the national heritage and promoting interest, education, knowledge and pride in heritage as well as facilitating the appreciation and enjoyment of heritage.  In my role as chair, my responsibility, working with the members of the council, its CEO Ms Virginia Teehan and her team, will be to deliver effectively on this mandate.<\/p><p> My vision for heritage is derived from a community perspective, building on people's connection to place, where heritage in all its forms is appreciated, conserved and protected.  My priority is to work with the Heritage Council and its executive in the preparation of the council&rsquo;s new strategic plan for 2022 to 2027.  This will build on the work of the existing plan, Heritage at the Heart, which was successfully delivered by the former chairman, Mr. Michael Parsons, the council members and the executive.  The preparation of a new strategy is a great opportunity to identify our shared vision for the Heritage Council.  Priority areas of focus will include challenges for heritage arising from climate change, biodiversity and the role of the National Biodiversity Data Centre, heritage in a post-pandemic Ireland, support for community heritage initiatives, heritage and education, heritage 2030, complex heritage challenges facing towns, villages and rural communities and retrofitting historic buildings and associated building skills shortages.<\/p><p> The Heritage Council is a relatively small organisation with a broad mandate.  Consequently, effective partnerships with key stakeholders are essential to success.  These include, in particular, partnerships with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, together with a range of other Departments, State agencies and Heritage Council-funded bodies.  Such collaborative working, in which I have extensive experience, helps to ensure best practice and best value for the people of Ireland.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention and, together with the CEO, will try to respond to any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Moloney.

I am a former city councillor from the north side of Dublin.  Dublin City Council has a very strong heritage role and can point to some real successes.

Funding has been made available, although funding is only part of the issue.  The Heritage Council has a real vision and shared that with the advisory group.

Obviously, the Moore Street area is part of a national monument and is a very important historical landscape.  From my point of view, the Heritage Council will be available to help and support, in any way it can, development in that space.  We appreciate very much the work that has already been undertaken by the Department and the advisory group in relation to Moore Street.

I have done so as part of the Moore Street advisory committee but also when I was Chairman for a brief time in the previous D&aacute;il of the then Joint Committee on Arts, Culture and Heritage.  Culture gets shifted around a little bit.  We had a very good engagement with the Heritage Council and at the time, I asked about the role of the council in local museums and about online collections.  At that stage, we did not predict the pandemic and could not have known how vital online collections and online engagement with the public would become.  While there were plans forthcoming, funding was not yet in place because the council was depending on the Government in that regard.  What is the position with regard to those plans?<\/p><p>Is there a larger demand from local museums or heritage centres to profile the material they hold or their areas online?  Is there greater collaboration between the Heritage Council and the local museum?  <\/p><p>  On F&aacute;ilte Ireland, we have all had the staycations.  Hopefully, many of us have benefited from some of the offerings that heritage councils and local authorities have put forward in recent years.  I have been an advocate for years and I have enjoyed my travels and wanders around Ireland.  However, much more can be done.  What does the Heritage Council see as the additional steps that can be taken?  The big elephant in the room is always funding.  What are the immediate practicalities?<\/p><p> The other questions I had were about Moore Street.  With each given day, there seem to be new finds and new bits and pieces that we were not aware of, although we had some type of knowledge in advance, for planning applications.  There is a live planning application for Moore Street and I have made own views on that clear.  The context of buildings should be taken into account.  Moore Street is a battlefield site.  We could end up like the Alamo, where the building is secured, but if we build high rises all around it, we lose the context of that historical building.  We have seen that with some of the other proposals around the city.  Merchant's Arch is one example.  If we build a high-rise hotel on top of Merchant's Arch, we then lose the context of the building.  There are other buildings that have been destroyed.  There seems to be a phase whereby we are destroying the buildings that are part of our living heritage.  When I was growing up, I remember going on the Wood Quay marches.  I remember Archer&rsquo;s Garage being knocked down.  It was thankfully rebuilt, although the damage was done.  Another example is Frescati House.  When I was very young I was involved in trying to secure it for the future.  We now have O'Rahilly house, which is to be destroyed.  We will see what comes of that court case.<\/p><p> My other question is on local heritage officers.  I remember at the time there was much discussion trying to ensure that every local authority had the local heritage officer.  Is that working?  Is it not working?  Who is funding it?  Should the council, rather than the Heritage Council, co-ordinate them rather than having to fund them?  That is enough for now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#B00700","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will start on the museums.  I will do a brief introduction and I will answer the questions insofar as I can.  I will then invite Ms Teehan to respond.  Museums have been a core part of the work of the Heritage Council for as long as I have been aware of the operations of the Heritage Council.  I will comment on the work of the museums standards programme for Ireland, MSPI, which the Heritage Council operates.  There are now 59 museums nationally, ranging in size from small, local community museums, to some of our larger cultural institutions, that are participating in the museum standards programme.  That programme has been a wonderful success in professionalising the service, as well as ensuring that we guarantee the protection of the collections going forward.  The Heritage Council is ambitious to continue to be involved in this area and to expand its role.  Certainly, the programme supports many people in the museums sector.  Some of our ambitions for the future include the digitisation of some of our museum pieces, so that they can be accessed both nationally and internationally, and so that we can ensure that we are protecting the heritage of Ireland in our museums going forward.  We will ensure that the training is available for people working in that particular sector also.  That is where we add particular value.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is a key body with which we collaborate on an ongoing basis.  Obviously, we are fortunate on the board of the Heritage Council to have a representative from the EPIC Irish Emigration Museum, one of the key national museums in the country.  He brings wonderful expertise and learning to the role and to the work of the Heritage Council.  His name is Dr. J. Patrick Greene and we are happy to have him with us.  There is always more that can be done, as the Deputy says.  Our ambition going into 2022, which is reflected in our budget for 2022, is to support additional funding for the museums sector.  I will hand over to Ms Teehan.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Moloney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  It is nice to see him again.  Specifically dealing with his query on museums, as Ms Moloney has said, in 2022 we will be setting up a specific grants scheme that is aimed at supporting museum curators, archivists and conservation officers in local authorities.  This is because we are aware of the points that the Deputy raised.  It is difficult for those who work in sometimes very small museums across the country to access funding.  Our community heritage grant scheme has been successful in securing the protection of museum objects.  For example, I was looking at some of the grants.  In the past few days we awarded just &euro;3,084, which is nothing.  That grant is responsible for the conservation of a Torah.  It is an important Jewish manuscript that had been rescued from the Holocaust.  That Torah belongs to the Jewish congregation in Dublin.  This small funding can help communities.  We are aware of the vulnerability of collections across the country.  We want to support them and we want to invest in them, as Ms Moloney says, in the training of the museum curators, archivists and conservation officers, as well as by giving funding specifically aimed towards that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Virginia Teehan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Regarding the Moore Street situation, I understand where the Deputy is coming from.  As he has identified, a planning application is currently active.  The Heritage Council does on occasion engage with the planning process.  While the Heritage Council&rsquo;s resources are meagre, we try to make the best value out of our resources by contributing to the forward planning processes.  In particular instances, we will make observations on individual planning applications.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to talk about the local heritage officers.  I mentioned in my opening statement that I was involved in the appointment of the first heritage officers nationally, in Galway city.  It has been one of the great successes, because it has contributed greatly to the work of local authorities by bringing in that additional expertise.  We have recently reviewed the heritage officer programme.  I am happy to say that there is a heritage officer now in place in every local authority.  That is a major step forward for us.  It helps the Heritage Council to reach into every community in Ireland.  It helps the communities by having that fantastic resource of skilled individuals available to them.  It helps the community to identify their precise priorities through the development of local heritage plans and, indeed, through the engagement with local heritage fora.  Like everything else, there are always opportunities for review and improvement.  The Heritage Council recently carried out a review of the heritage officer programme in association with the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  There are a few recommendations, which we will be moving forward to implement in the new year, around continuing to strengthen the role of heritage officer within, and embed it further within, the local government structures, to ensure that the role is embedded throughout the local authority, and to re-engage with the heritage fora and heritage plan.  I appreciate that has been a challenge during Covid-19, but perhaps it is time to revisit that.  We also provide support to our cadre of heritage officers with continued support and training in the new areas of expertise that are continuing to emerge in the heritage field.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Moloney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>As the Chairman said, we have 31 heritage officers throughout the country and tomorrow we are launching the publication of the review of this hugely successful programme.

We are increasing that budget annually because the delivery on the ground is so significant.  Heritage officers are also central to the delivery of National Heritage Week, which has been hugely successful during the Covid pandemic.  We transferred it to an online platform and it has been very good for communities.  It has helped to sustain activity and a sense of connectivity and well-being.  The programme probably needs additional support, especially in the larger local authorities where heritage officers are very busy.  We will look to scale that as appropriate.

They both have fantastic jobs; I would love either of them.  Heritage is a great thing.  I acknowledge Dr. Moloney's vast experience of local government.  I have come across her in many guises.  Sometimes she has not seen me watching her, but at other times we have encountered each other and chatted.  She has an amazing track record; it is important that I share that with the committee.  I spoke to staff on a number of councils in County Galway who speak very highly of her, as do members of the County and City Management Association.  The committee knows her from National Oversight and Audit Commission; I do not see that on her CV but she came before us previously.  She is steeped in local government, which is an important facet in how we address heritage because it overlays so much, which is very important.  I also wish Ms Teehan every success.<\/p> <p>  The Heritage Council is a wonderful organisation.  Somehow people think it is some sort of elitist group and do not quite understand its governance.  There is a little work to be done in explaining the governance of the Heritage Council and that it is there to help and support people.  If I was to ask the representatives to take away anything from today's proceedings, it would be that I would like to see an overarching and very much stronger policy emerge from the Heritage Council.  As has been said already, there are 31 heritage officers in local authorities.  We may not have the full number of conservation officers, although their roles overlap with those of heritage officers and arts officers.  One of the great things is that we have built heritage and national heritage.  I am particularly interested in environmental heritage and heritage gardens.  I studied horticulture and worked in the National Botanic Gardens in Dublin, in addition to those in London, Canada and Greece.  I have a major interest in travelling and seeing heritage gardens.  One of the first things I look at everywhere I go are unique heritage buildings, especially heritage gardens.  It is a real thing in terms of the overlap with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  We have local authority staff but they are not Heritage Council staff.  I imagine that now that transition funding has gone straight over, heritage officers are fully funded by local authorities and they come under pressure there.  They work closely with the planning authorities.  We know that each of the authorities have their city and county development plans.  My council unanimously supported me on both buildings I suggested being listed as protected structures, but I had great difficulty in convincing and encountered resistance from the establishment, that is, the council executive.  There was a view that if we are pushing for protected structures we are in some way dulling down the potential for development when we can have both.  That is something we need to get across.<\/p> <p>  It is very important that we look at the Heritage Council plan.  Its corporate plan finishes this year.  I went online before this meeting to see details of the next plan.  We know about Heritage Ireland 2030, which is important and exciting, and that there is substantial public engagement, which says much about the organisation and that is great.  We also know that there is a summary of the Heritage Council's two public consultations and that it had a specific set of consultations with professional people or, shall we say, people directly involved in the heritage area.  I acknowledge that was a very clever move on the council's part because it included different disciplines, expertise and, perhaps, views.  It is important that we do not have groupthink but engagement at all levels on heritage.<\/p> <p>  I would now like a summary of the focus engagement.  Where are we going with it?  The Heritage Council had a very substantial consultation that I presume it analysed and prioritised in sets of subject matter so there are themes, specific proposals, ideas and actions, but following on from proposals and actions there are timelines.  I would like to hear about those - not necessarily today if there is not enough time - and I ask the representatives to send the committee a summary of the issues on which people engaged because that is what we want to hear about.  What is the next stage of the plan?  <\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the important work of An Taisce of which I have been a member for years.  It has a struggling membership with an older age profile.  People do not have the same time, they are working, the dynamics of their lives have very much changed in the past few years and, therefore, this sector has relied heavily on voluntary contributions, workers and expertise.  We will have to up it a gear and this is where the Heritage Council has a role.  It should ultimately be a referring group.  We should be able to refer to it, along with local authorities.  I would like to see more cross-engagement in the sector.  I wish the Heritage Council well.  It is an exciting time for both its representatives and I wish them the very best of luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#D00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his kind words.  Indeed, our paths have crossed before.  His point on public understanding of what the Heritage Council does is certainly very well made.  We are there to help and support people who, like us, are passionate about heritage.  It is an ask from us of the committee to give us the exposure so that we can spread that news.  We are building our profile in order that people understand that we are here to help and support them through our very broad remit and areas of activity, which include grants programmes and advisory programmes.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the area of policy.  We input into policy on an ongoing basis.  At very many meetings of the Heritage Council we make submissions to developments by other agencies in the heritage field and feed in our views on how they can strengthen and advance their activities in the policy area.<\/p> <p>  To clarify, funding for the heritage officer programme is still part funded by the Heritage Council.  From our perspective, it is very important that that continues and will be recognised as a very positive contribution in the recent review of the heritage officer programme.  We not only help in the financial area with salaries but also by supporting the network of local authority heritage officers and ensuring that we have regard to and support their training needs.<\/p> <p>  On Heritage Ireland, the Heritage Council assisted the Department in doing quite a lot of work in the consultation area the Senator referred to.  We have a direct line of sight to the various stakeholders and it was certainly a very interesting consultation exercise.  Quite a few key themes emerged from it.  I will ask Ms Teehan to take us through some of them.<\/p> <p>  We have just commenced work on the preparation of our strategic plan for 2022 to 2027 and have had some initial discussions.  We will be very happy to share the plan with the committee when it is completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Moloney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":550,"content":"<p>To answer the Senator's question on the consultation process, as he said, we engaged with the general public, those working in the heritage sector and the academic community.  There were a couple of strands to our work in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I will address his more general comments related to areas around communication and the number of different bodies involved in heritage.<\/p><p>There is a huge ecosystem out there in this regard and it is difficult for individuals and communities to know who does what.  Therefore, there must be a mapping of this information and that need was identified as a key issue.  <\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the role of young people.  Getting them engaged with heritage was a key theme that ran through all the consultations, but particularly those involving communities.  It is one area where we like to think that we have had an impact.  Our community grants scheme delivers significant results on the ground for communities.  They are small grants, but they help to bring people together to work for a common objective, be that the clearing of a graveyard, restoring a specialised piece of fabric or developing interpretive panels in towns such as Killmallock and other towns around the country.  Those grants are a focal point for communities.  One of our aims involves growing that aspect, bringing communities together and developing best practice for heritage and giving advice and leadership in that regard.<\/p><p> As my chairperson identified, we are involved in the area of technology in supporting community groups and individuals in the application of technology in heritage practice and knowledge sharing and access to heritage professionals.  That is something communities want.  They want to work in heritage, but they also wish to ensure that they are doing the right thing and not damaging archaeological sites and that they are observing best practice in graveyards, for example.  Communities wish to ensure they are doing something good that will last forever.  In addition, communities and the public are looking for an infrastructure of heritage networks.  There is An Taisce and the big NGOs, but smaller groups are active on the ground as well.  Those could include small groups interested in their local bogs, as well organisations in inner city Dublin concerned with the oral history of Stoneybatter and similar places.  Therefore, there is a wide range of groups.  Our role is to bring them together and to put in place some infrastructure to support them.  We must also endeavour to work across Departments, because to the public we are siloed.  The Heritage Council must work with elected representatives and civil servants to cut through some of the bureaucracy and red tape to make it easy for people.<\/p><p> Those are some of the key issues that arose in the consultations with the public.  I should also not forget to mention the role of local authorities and local authority heritage officers, the funding we give through the local authority heritage officers programme to local authorities and the leadership those heritage officers provide on the ground.  It is an important facet of what we do.  It is mentioned in the programme for Government that we should support and grow that scheme and we are happy to do that.  Equally, we are exploring growing the range of expertise available in local authorities in the context of biodiversity officers.  I mentioned the other professionals concerned in this context.<\/p><p> Returning to the heritage sector, the diversity of Ireland, the growing and changing face of modern Ireland and the identity of Ireland must be protected.  It must be inclusive.  Heritage must include all the members of society and all people, no matter where they are from, or their race, creed or colour.  That aspect must be central to the policies and values underpinning Heritage Ireland.  The heritage sector must speak with one voice and we must be holistic in our approach.  That is something that happens in all sectors.  Our heritage remit includes the natural, built and cultural sectors, and we span everything from swans to ponds, buildings, archives, trees and biodiversity.  Represented on the ground, then, are all sorts of experts and people with brilliant experience.  However, we must speak with one voice in this forum, at Government level and to our communities to serve them more coherently than we are.  We need a sound infrastructure for heritage management.  We are beginning to grow that facet at local authority level, but we must work more comprehensively with the NGO sector.  We are doing that a bit already.  We have set up a new grant scheme for the NGO sector for those organisations that cannot get funding for themselves.  That undertaking was established last year as part of our Covid-19 response program.  It has been hugely successful and it is bringing people together to speak together.<\/p><p> Local authorities are a crucial factor in leadership for heritage.  Those in large urban areas, such as in Dublin, where there can be disparate interests, need to have an identifiable leader.  The sector looks to the local authorities for leadership, and that is particularly the case in rural areas, which have been hollowed out because of the impact of Covid-19, Brexit and other economic problems.  In many cases, small towns and villages in many places are without souls and their identity and leadership must come through exploring the heritage through their local authorities.  <\/p><p> Another issue we have concerns sustained funding.  We operate in accordance with annual funding streams, but for some heritage projects, though, we require funding over several years and the sectors look to us to provide them with funding for several years.  I refer to large infrastructure projects, such as the restoration of walled towns and the restoration of historic railings.  Keeping that sense of the public realm space being in good order requires sustained funding, which we cannot currently guarantee.  That is a problem we must resolve.<\/p><p> Our colleagues in the sector used a lovely phrase: &ldquo;Daisies grow on both sides of the Border&rdquo;.  Heritage does not stop on the Border and birds fly across the whole landmass and seas.  We must work more closely with our colleagues on the other side of the Border.  We already do so and we have strong relationships with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, but we must examine having more comprehensive joint programmes with colleagues not only in Northern Ireland but also in Europe.<\/p><p> That is a summary of those key points raised during the consultation.  As Dr. Moloney said, this document has been co-ordinated by the Department.  I understand that it is at an advanced stage of development and that it will, hopefully, be launched in early 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Virginia Teehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":552,"content":"<p>It would be helpful for us if the issues raised by Ms Teehan were to be sent to the committee.

The required funding and support exist in this context, so we wish to make it as easy as possible for people to engage with the Heritage Council and for the local authority heritage officers to do their work.  The funding over several years aspect is also important in all regards when trying to plan for the longer term.  I also learned something else from that interaction, because I did not realise that Senator Boyhan had such experience in heritage gardens over the years.

My background is in architecture and I have had the privilege of spending most of my career working with protected structures.  My questions, then, come from an architectural background and concern the environment in that regard.<\/p> <p>  If we are serious about climate neutrality and sustainability, then we must transform and strengthen the policies and regulations around buildings throughout the procurement process.  A cradle-to-cradle approach must be adopted, and that must begin with life-cycle carbon reporting at the application stage and the introduction of carbon limits, as used in other European jurisdictions, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.  Critical to this undertaking is the introduction of life-cycle assessments, which would allow us to measure the level of embodied carbon and to introduce a national environmental product declaration database to standardise the way in which we provide data about the environmental impacts of construction materials.  <\/p> <p>  We require a clear policy plan on how we can reduce energy emissions in our built environment.  As I understand it, that is the aim of the national policy on architecture, NPA, which has yet to be published.  In Places for People: Ireland's National Policy on Architecture from 2020, which emerged following public consultation on the NPA, it was stated that the State requires a build environment research platform that will have continuous feedback to inform high-quality design and construction.  I have three questions related to that context.  Will the final NPA policy document contain a definite proposal for a national built environment research body?<\/p><p>What form is that likely to take?  When can we expect the NPA to be published?  When can we expect Ireland to introduce the aforementioned frameworks and regulations necessary for carbon reduction in our built environment?

We are proposing and have recommended that a comprehensive life-cycle approach to the construction and management of new and existing buildings be adopted.  I understand that is included.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Moloney said, this is an area where we need to upskill ourselves.  Our knowledge is good.  We agree with the view that the most sustainable building is the one that exists.  We direct funding towards the owners of buildings to support them in the protection of those buildings and wish to continue to do so.  It is a difficult area for us because it is sometimes hard for agencies to support private owners in the management of their properties, but we are supportive of that through our historic towns initiatives and other grant schemes.

I will ask about the priority in terms of support for community heritage initiatives.  I have two aspects of that.<\/p> <p>  The Chair spoke about the importance of heritage in terms of community and sense of place and how, when it is lost, it can be difficult to get back.  One area in which this can be seen is naming.  I have seen this done well and badly with new housing developments, indeed entire new communities.  Sometimes they are named by the developer in a bland, generic way that has no attachment to the area.  Sometimes they are named with regard to the name or history of the local area and that connection is included in the name from the start.  That is valuable.  When you grow up in an area, you hear all these names and have no idea what they mean.  Over the years, you ask questions and find out the history and heritage, which sparks interest in that.  That is important in giving a sense of place and connect to communities and giving communities the sense that there was a history before the new development came along.<\/p> <p>  I realised in more recent years that suburbs of Dublin that I just saw as suburbs were originally towns and villages, with all the history that goes with that.  Naming is important but it is done sporadically throughout the country.  The point about the 31 local authorities now having heritage officers is important.  Is there something the Heritage Council can do in terms of issue guidelines or best practice to try to ensure through the local authorities and heritage officers that naming is done well everywhere?  It is a simple thing but there is huge value to be added by doing that.<\/p> <p>  Every area has built and natural heritage but some are much better at protecting, resourcing or developing that than others.  Is there something the Heritage Council can do in terms of priorities and support to give extra prioritisation to communities that may be disadvantaged and have less human capital?  Even local community heritage groups or initiatives are often seen in more advantaged areas and less frequently in disadvantaged areas, though there are exceptions to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#F00600","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I am particularly passionate about community heritage.  I have seen the value it brings from the bottom up in building community, sense of place and pride of place.  The suggestion the Deputy made around naming is one we will take away with us.  I have seen it working - \"sporadically\" is a good word for it - in different parts of the country.  Some people have naming committees in place and some insist the names are in Irish and related to the heritage and history of the area.  That will be one of our takeaways from today.<\/p> <p>  An initiative I have been involved in in a voluntary capacity is the Burrenbeo Trust, which identifies place-based learning as its key priority.  It is embedded in the local area and does a lot of good programmes in the national and secondary schools in its area, built around what is in the curtilage of the catchment area of the school.  I would like the Heritage Council to build on that.  Maybe we could spread that into wider currency across the country.<\/p> <p>  The same organisation has done quite a lot in working with voluntary groups - in Tidy Towns, for instance - to encourage them to develop their local heritage plans.  That might address the Deputy's second point somewhat around the participation and resourcing of communities who might not be as able to access or understand the opportunities funded and supported by the Heritage Council to encourage communities to learn from and help one another along the way.  I envisage we will continue to resource that area.<\/p> <p>  A priority area identified for the new heritage plan is that of inclusion.  We want to ensure heritage belongs to everybody and that new communities or people who feel excluded for other reasons are recognised as being important.  Some projects in national heritage week 2021 in the area of inclusion were heartening exemplars of best practice that we hope to build on and that will inspire others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Moloney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I share the Deputy's interest in placenames or logainmneacha.

The role that local authorities play in providing leadership is very helpful.  Community groups are mainly peopled by volunteers.  We get some great people.  We get community groups that go through ups and downs, for a variety of reasons, but they need support - financial support from us and support and leadership from their communities.  Ms Moloney and I saw an excellent example of community leadership last week in County Offaly, where the Offaly Archives were opened and they are actually contracting out a service to the local authority.  There is an excellent history society which is developing a service of local value.  That is a very important service.  There are some very good examples of community practice across Ireland and our community fund seeks to support them.

Ballingarry is the area where I live and between two of the villages close to where I live, there is a place called Knockfierna.  Its name means &ldquo;hill of truth&rdquo;, so if the Chairman wonders why I always tell the truth, it is because I live on the hill of truth.  I love heritage and I love everything to do with our heritage.  I have been in construction all my life.  In 2018, we rebuilt the old oifig an phoist in Kilmallock, which is now the new credit union.  It was a fantastic project.  It went on longer than was anticipated but the building needed the care to bring it back into production.  Only for the credit union getting that building at the time, it could not have stayed open during Covid.  It gave the credit union accessibility to a wide area due to the mailing room and it allowed the staff to be there.  It was brilliant to see that.<\/p> <p>  In Limerick, we have conservation officers like Tom Cassidy and Sarah McCutcheon but the resources are not there for them.  I meet with Mr. Cassidy on a regular basis on different projects.  If we have to rebuild our old stock, they must have the supports they need.  If somebody falls ill in their job, there is no one there to take on the project, so it sits still and does not go forward.<\/p> <p>  I love old buildings and I want to protect them but I have a common sense side to me as well.  I look at some places that are falling down.  The cost of rebuilding certain places is not worth it, in particular domestic homes.  I am talking about streetscapes in towns and villages.  What I would like to see happening for buildings that have gone so far, and where we want to bring a new generation into the towns and also get eco-friendly houses which are better for the environment, is for us to keep the front fa&ccedil;ades of buildings and the old roof structures.  If they need to be made more modern behind that, let it happen.  In the same way that there can be the uneconomical repair of a car, there can be the uneconomical repair of a building.  To do that would still keep the front fa&ccedil;ade on the street.  If the rest of the house is not worth protecting, we could just keep the front.  At the same time, I believe our iconic buildings need to be protected.<\/p> <p>  I have seen places where people went for insurance on their domestic house and they could not insurance on the front room, inside the front door, because it had a timber lath ceiling.  The advice was that they had to remove the timber lath ceiling, fireproof it and put it back in place.  The insurance company would not insure the front part of the building but as the next room was a new extension on the rear of the house, it would insure that.  We have to try to get rid of that.  That is what I mean by uneconomical repairs.<\/p> <p>  I am involved in vintage clubs to celebrate the heritage we have through vintage machinery, going back from modern machinery to the horse.  I do a lot of charity runs to raise money for different charities.  I have visited many graveyards, especially in November, and I see that many are in need of funding in order to protect them.  Again, even if the funding was there, we need the proper groups that will take it on and have respect within the graveyards.  I have a list of graveyards where, for ten or 12 years, people cannot go in to visit their loved ones because they are in dread of a protected structure within the graveyard that has been fenced off by a metal fence and there is no funding to repair it.  That is very hard.  That is as hard as the situation during Covid where people cannot visit their families.  They might want to sit down beside the grave and have a chat, and there is nothing wrong with that.  However, this is preventing people from getting to the graveyards.  That is wrong.<\/p> <p>  I am 100% for biodiversity.  I am 100% for replacing our old stock and also for modernising the old stock, with the old meeting the new.  That is great and it brings people into this.  To get the youth involved in heritage, we have to bring it to their level.  The way to bring it to the level of young people and to make it interesting for them is to show them.  I am talking about re-enactments at different places in order to make history fun and young people learn about their heritage.  If we showed a child today a phone which is not that old but has the dial on it, they would look at it and ask, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;, and they would wonder why they cannot press it.  Let us bring them back to things like the phone where people twisted a handle to ring the exchange.  We need to bring them in and give this to them through fun.  We can drop a seed and, in a year or two, they may come back and look for more fun.  In that way, we teach them about our heritage because they consider it so backwards that it is enjoyable for them to watch, but they also learn.  To me, that is a way forward.  When the greenway was opened in Limerick recently, we saw the replacement of the houses along the greenway.  It was an outstanding example of what can be done if we have the right people doing the right work.<\/p> <p>  I go around a lot of buildings and people ask me how I can help.  The first thing I see is the dread on their faces when they hear the word &ldquo;listed&rdquo; and they think they will have to sell the whole place to get the work done.  I was in a premises recently where the roof has been off since the 1950s due to the rates.  It is a fabulous, iconic building.  I have been looking outside of this country to get investors in to try to bring back buildings like this in certain areas.  They are afraid because every time they went about doing it, there was a litany of problems in front of them that they had to deal with, and the investors ran for the hills.  We have come to a new approach that I am currently looking at for people with iconic buildings so that, for investigation purposes, somebody can go in and clean around the building, make a full investigation into what needs to be done to the building and mark all the stones as they are.  We can then take that into account and get proper costings for the repair of the building to make it as close as can be to the original by doing minor works to it, so we can then go to investors.  That can be done under section 57.  We welcome people coming in to do it but, again, people who have respect for the building, who can be on a list and who can go in and respectfully take on these buildings.  As a country, if the Government or the Heritage Council cannot support this, we can bring in investors from outside the country who will want to do this and who might want to reopen and let the public back in to see such buildings.<\/p> <p>  What I want from today is the name of a contact person to go to in order to help me and guide me, and to cut through the red tape so I can help replace many of the iconic buildings, structures, fences and walls, and so we can all work together.  I want us to move forward without having a wall put in front of us.  If the Heritage Council comes up with something, I want to be able to see if that can be simplified so we can all move forward and get more buildings protected.  That is what I want from today.  I want a direct contact from the Heritage Council.<\/p><p>I would like the witnesses to come and see one or two of the buildings I have in mind.  I can guarantee that we will get investors in there.  We have Adare and Croom.  There are many fantastic buildings in Kilmallock, Askeaton, where some date from the 14th century, and other places, but only one or two of them are open to the public.  We need all of them to be opened up.  There are buildings that are mind-blowing for the next generation.  I ask the witnesses to open up a line communication with me such that we can all work together and move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#G00300","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":566,"content":"<p>The Deputy's passion for heritage is very obvious from the inputs he has had.

We have a role to play in ensuring that the appreciation of heritage is acknowledged.

We have been fortunate in that our funding has been increased by over 40% in the past two years.  We are really grateful for that.<\/p> <p>  There is a major job of work to be done.

Banks are also very fine, significant buildings, especially in country towns.  Frequently, they represent the best of the craft and skill of the locality, for instance, the good limestone or granite, depending on where you are from.  You will meet people whose fathers cut the stones or were involved on the site in designing them.  We would like to see, at least, as Deputy O'Donoghue was talking about, that both the architectural heritage and the local history of these buildings are protected as they transition into new use.

Where we often see buildings of architectural significance and even protected structures damaged, sometimes to a minor degree in terms of the work that is done but from a visual perspective it is quite stark, does the planning system offer enough protection to our protected buildings and architectural conservation areas and, in general, to heritage buildings that may not have official designation?  It probably comes down to the enforcement section of planning.  You can badly damage a protected structure quickly through construction work that can take a long time to restore and take a long time for enforcement to get the actions needed to restore it.<\/p><p>Does Dr. Moloney think the planning system protects our heritage buildings and protected structures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#K01000","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>The planning system is very disparate and there are many different dimensions to it.  I am conscious that a proposed review of planning in general is likely to commence.  In general, the planning system provides a lot of protection to protected structures, in particular through the county development plan process and the identification of areas of conservation value.<\/p> <p>  The other area that possibly needs a bit of additional investment is education, to make sure that people understand the damage that they could potentially be doing.  Sometimes, people with the best will in the world do something that they do not fully understand.  It comes back to some of the points Ms Teehan made around the skill level and craftsmanship in this particular area.  It is one of the initiatives that we hope to improve and to roll out to make sure that the people who engage in construction activity will have the right skills to develop it.<\/p> <p>  It would be worth our while perhaps to reflect on some of the challenging situations in which we found ourselves in recent years and to see where heritage was not as well protected, in particular in regard to buildings that are not on the record of protected structures.  We can all think of a couple of examples of where there was a significant loss, which we wish had not happened.  We must ask what needs to be done in those particular situations.  Ms Teehan may wish to add something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Moloney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637625600,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I think the legislation is robust.  There are challenges in its implementation.  The conservation officers need additional support, in particular in larger areas.  There is not a full complement of conservation officers across the country and it would be helpful if there were.  We hope to support those conservation officers who are in office by providing additional funds for them next year.  As Dr. Moloney says, a review of the planning legislation is pending and we will be anxious to see what the outcome of that will be, and to make it more efficient for the owners of both historic properties and protected structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Virginia Teehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>That is the end of our questioning.

We are very grateful to members for the opportunity to present before the committee today.

We will take it and the other issues raised with us by committee members away with us.<\/p> <p>  We are here to support the work of the committee.  We would be delighted to engage with it at any time.  We are anxious to have the committee's support to promote heritage and, as part of that, to promote what we do as part of the overall landscape of heritage.  One of the things I would like to thank the committee for today is giving us the level of exposure for this important area within its remit.  I hope we can work together on that in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021112300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1637625600,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Moloney.  I add my congratulations to those of the members.  She has significant experience in local government as well and that is very important.  She will have heard the great support for heritage and the work of the Heritage Council from committee members.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will come before the committee in three weeks' time to give us an update on work he has been doing within his remit in the heritage sector and electoral reform.  He has been a great champion of heritage over the years.<\/p> <p>  I noted some of the points that were made.  Dr. Moloney can let us know how we can assist her with the communication plan to highlight the work of the Heritage Council.  We would be very happy to assist her either in our work as public representatives or through the committee.  I am sure the committee is in agreement on that.<\/p> <p>  It is important to get feedback on the issues raised by those who engage with the Heritage Council so we can learn how we can assist with any concerns.  A standardised marking system for urban heritage trails would be a fantastic initiative if we could do it.  That would be good for all.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the review of the planning system.  The committee will engage in that and we would be interested in feeding the views of the Heritage Council into the process.  I am not sure how the process will work but the heritage voice in the planning system needs to be very strong.
