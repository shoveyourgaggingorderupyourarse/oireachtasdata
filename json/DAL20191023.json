The budget debate has always been an opportunity for Deputies to discuss relevant issues both around the country and in their own constituencies.  I would like to discuss a few issues.<\/p>  <p>  There has been huge frustration over the summer months at farm gate level regarding agriculture and the prices farmers or primary producers are getting for their food.  We have made great strides on regulations over the decades, in the last 25 years in particular.  Going back to the late 1950s and even before that, the product produced at farm gate level in Ireland has been of the highest quality and we can always market it globally as one of the better food products.  We must have food security and hold a proper and meaningful discussion about balanced diets, which everyone needs, and the amount of quality food people are eating.  Some people say emerging patterns show that consumers will pay for everything bar food.  I refer to the food basket.  One of the reasons the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, was set up was to ensure food security and that Europe would never again go hungry.  We have to make sure the product we are producing has a marketplace and that we can stand over it.  Those who work hardest and who as farmers would say are getting their hands dirty must be rewarded for the work they are doing. <\/p><p>The real challenge for us is to make sure this is the case.  When one looks at all the factors within the agriculture industry, the perception is that everybody seems to be getting their fair crack of the whip but the farmer is not.  We look at prices, particularly in the past 12 to 18 months and particularly for beef farmers.  Costs have escalated enormously.  I have had discussions with many agricultural advisers over the past while and some accountants who have gone through the figures forensically and they have said the margin is not there on the beef side.  We talk about young farmers.  If one looks at any parish, be it in Donegal, Cork, Galway or the east coast, one can see that the number of young people participating in farming is dwindling every year.  If a reasonable living could be derived from agriculture, it would be attractive to young people.  We must make sure that at the core of the policies we pursue is the protection of the primary producer, that is, the person who gets his or her hands dirty and produces the excellent food we all have had the benefit of eating.  <\/p> <p> Regarding the threatened cuts to the CAP, we need to assess the European project and look at food security.  Many people are talking about the green agenda.  First and foremost, we make sure that the product we put on our shelves and eat is of the highest quality.  We must look at how the CAP is funded to ensure farmers can derive a proper living from agriculture.  <\/p> <p> It was reported last week after a Topical Issue raised by Deputy O'Keeffe that discussions are ongoing regarding the exact route of the Cork-Limerick road, which will connect the second city of the Republic with the third.  This road has been much promised and there has been much discussion about it, for example, in Project Ireland 2040 and every other document that has been brought forward, yet it is not moving apace.  It is important for the south west that this project is prioritised and funded to enable it to go from its current stage to planning.  There is a long way to go on this.  With regard to discussions with various interested parties in places like Charleville, the people involved ask when this project will go ahead, throw their eyes up to heaven and say this is the long finger of the long finger of the long finger.  <\/p> <p> Kanturk Community Hospital has submitted an application for an extension that is going through the county council.  Further information has been requested.  While there was talk that the project would be delivered in 2019, the latest indications are that it will be delivered in 2021 or 2022.  This includes both the community hospital in Millstreet and Kanturk Community Hospital.  These are vital pieces of infrastructure for elderly people who need step-down facilities after being in acute hospitals along with top-of-the-range medical treatment.  It is important that these projects are pushed.  It is proposed that we have a debate tomorrow afternoon on the cost of the national children's hospital and where that is.  Information is coming from people within the HSE that a raft of community hospital projects were promised in 2017 and 2018.  For some reason, these projects have been delayed.  They did not even show up in the capital plan.  I know the 2019 capital plan was announced in September.  Normally, if we were doing a job, we would be talking about it in January but it was September in order that there was a document out there.  I do not think anybody accepted that there was anything meaningful or genuine in it.  <\/p> <p> The situation regarding applications for the fair deal scheme is crazy.  People are waiting seven, eight, nine or ten weeks.  This has escalated from the middle of April when it was three to four weeks.  It is now seven, eight, nine or ten weeks, which is costing families with a loved one who needs full-time care.  These families are making very difficult decisions about the continuing care of their relatives.  They are filling in the fair deal application form, which then goes to the HSE and is not processed for seven to eight weeks.  This costs the families &euro;7,000, &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000 - money ordinary working families simply do not have.  There was nothing about it in the run-up to the local elections but at the end of May, letters were circulated within the HSE to say that no extra home help hours would be made available until November.  These letters were correct because throughout the summer, it was nigh on impossible to get home help care for any person who needed it.  There are people who can be looked after in their own homes with a home care package but this was not offered throughout the summer, which was a disgrace.  Extra home help hours were negotiated in the budget, particularly because our negotiating team looked hard for them, but this will not be enough to match the need within communities.  The more home help care is put into the system, the more people we can keep in their own homes and the fewer people will be in nursing homes.  When one looks at the number of hours we provide in home help and the fact that almost &euro;1,000 is spent every week on fair deal scheme packages, one can see it does not make sense in any way, shape or form.  One often looks at the budget for the HSE and wonders whether anybody from the HSE, the Department of Health, the Minister for Health or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has considered trying some common sense first and seeing whether they can make savings and whether if they invest in a particular aspect of the budget, they will be able to make savings in respect of other aspects.  Deputy O'Dea has a Bill before the House to say that if somebody is waiting for the fair deal, the funding that is there should be used for a home care package.  It would certainly help because it is very much needed.  <\/p> <p> Regarding the carer's allowance section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, when a person applies for carer's allowance, we are talking about waiting between 14 and 16 weeks for that application to be processed.  In response to a number of questions I asked, the Taoiseach told me that the delays relate to anything involving medical reports or assessments.  We are talking about 16 weeks from the time an application is made, bearing in mind that the family has now decided that somebody will apply for the carer's allowance and has made preparations to either reduce his or her working hours to 15 hours or give up work completely.  It is the same with carer's benefit, a PRSI-based payment that was brought in by former Minister Tom Kitt way back.  If there is a review of an application that takes up to two or three more months on top of the waiting period and if there is an appeal that is successful, we are talking about a 12-month period from the time that family made the decision to care for its loved one in his or her own home and the time the carer's allowance is granted.  In some instances, the person who needs full-time care has passed on to his or her eternal reward without having carer's allowance paid to his or her carer.  <\/p><p>The reality is that no money is being saved by the State in any way, shape or form.  We need to look at that.  We need to look at the reviews and processing of applications of social welfare allowances, including disability allowance, which take up so much of the time of Deputies' constituency offices.<\/p> <p> On the HSE, there have been various negotiations through 2019 regarding the availability of Tagrisso, a lung cancer drug.  In August, there were indications that it was being blocked because there was no funding for it in the 2019 budget.  It is unacceptable for people making decisions regarding the treatment of cancer and who are awaiting the drug to be told that it will not be available until early 2020.  If we are still here in early 2020, I will raise this issue again.  I will do so in the coming months to give prominence to the issues facing people looking for this drug to safeguard their quality of life for them and that of their families.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach offered an apology on behalf of the State.  We will be examining situations involving drugs such as Tagrisso which are not being processed through the system.<\/p> <p> On education, the Government has made many promises regarding an amalgamated school in Kanturk.  It was announced in the summer that the project had gone to tender.  There was much fanfare and trumpet blasting.  However, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, informed me in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled a couple of weeks ago that it has not gone to tender and is still awaiting some technical amendments to the tender documents.  I am unsure from where the fake news story that it had gone to tender came.  The people of Kanturk deserve the truth about the project because it has been going on long enough.  When it goes to tender, we can then have trumpet blasts and shouts of joy.<\/p> <p> I will turn to the funding crisis being experienced by St. Joseph's Foundation, COPE Foundation and the wider disability sector.  As for waiting lists, we were promised 100 extra therapists last year to carry out assessments of need.  In some cases, it can take up to four years for a child to receive the appropriate interventions, including an assessment of need and the appointment of a therapist.  That is simply not acceptable and it is going under the radar.  I could not be more passionate about this issue.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, answered questions in the House yesterday.  I do not doubt her good intentions.  However, she is completely invisible in the crisis relating to children in Ireland in 2019.  All Deputies saw the photo of the homeless boy, Sam, which was published in recent days.  The Minister is not directly responsible for housing and so on, but she is the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs under the Constitution.  I predict that whoever is in these Houses in 25 years' time will have to apologise for what is going on now in terms of services being provided for children.  It is totally deplorable.  The media focuses on this issue and it is the responsibility of several Departments but I have never seen an article appraising the performance of the Minister, Deputy Zappone.  There is no input from her in respect of the crisis facing children in every aspect of Irish society.  Historically, the issues faced by previous generations were raised in the D&aacute;il and often ignored.  This Minister is absolutely ignoring the plight of children in 2019.<\/p> <p> On disability services, last week, the chief executive of the COPE Foundation stated that it needs &euro;34 million in additional investment.  It took significant effort for him to go public on the issue because he wanted the foundation to continue working on its programmes and ensure it is doing the best it could.  However, he was forced to cry for help.  What is happening in the disability sector is deplorable.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, is a fine person and so on.  Some &euro;10 million was allocated to respite care last year, but it had no effect whatsoever.  It was far easier to get respite care in 2017 than it is in 2019.  Respite care is currently non-existent.  The Government referred to shared care plans.  I have been in negotiations with the HSE to try to put shared care plans in place.  Senior HSE executives have told us that the Government and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, are at sea in terms of the crisis coming down the tracks in respect of people with disabilities.  We are not getting any traction on the issue.  I read an article published during the summer in which Ministers were given a score out of ten.  It did not reflect the crisis in the disability sector.  We will be indicted for the lack of compassion and understanding of the crisis within the disability sector and the organisations charged with trying to provide care and services for young people.<\/p> <p> On planning, I note there is a homeless crisis and discussions are ongoing on homelessness and on the challenges in respect of high-rise nine or ten-storey apartments.  There is discussion of further development on the east coast and the significant growth of urban populations.  We are neglecting the west coast.  The job losses in Shannon and Cork announced today are significant blows to those communities.  The Shannon Airport issue is an indictment of policy in this area.  We must address planning regulations and the ability to object to planning applications, sometimes on the basis of a non-planning issue.  There should be grounds in legislation to turf out such objections and a limit on the distance between the property of a person wishing to make a planning objection and the site in question.  We must examine the decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, particularly in regard to one-off houses.  Any house that is given full planning permission by a council, by God, when it goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that is the end of that.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not paying sufficient regard to regional or balanced development.  We will end up with a huge population on the east coast.  It has been said that we will tilt into the Irish Sea unless there is proper development and proper planning on the west coast.<\/p> <p> The \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme on Monday night dealt with the issue of children who are constantly homeless and their ability to swallow.  Surely to God, that will not be the image of Ireland in 2019.  There is a significant number of issues that need to be tackled and a significant number of Ministers who are not on top of their brief in respect of the serious social challenges in communities.  We will pay for the lack of foresight long into the future if the issues I have outlined are not tackled in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300003#A00500","speaker":"1283","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571820300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571820300,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 9.58 a.m. and resumed at 10.30 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1571820900,"counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300006#G00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","time":1571820900,"counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300006#G00300"},{"type":"question","time":1571820900,"counter":17,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[43652\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300006#G00400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the public services card and the findings of the Data Protection Commissioner on same; if enforcement proceedings have been issued by the Data Protection Commissioner; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1571820900,"counter":18,"content":"<p>My question to the Minister is more or less self-explanatory.

Successive Governments since have reaffirmed this policy both in Government decisions and through legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2017, the Data Protection Commission commenced an investigation into the standard authentication framework environment-public services card, SAFE-PSC, process and delivered its final report to the Department on 15 August this year.

Therefore it is very difficult to tell the Deputy, with 100% clarity, what we would do until we see that enforcement notice but I can reiterate the legal advice we have, which is numerous, tells us that the legal basis for conducting the safety registration pass, the production of PSC card, the retention of the data and the transparency of that entire process is entirely legitimate with regard to the various pieces of legislation and amended legislation that has been passed by successive Government over many years.  Therefore, if the enforcement notice comes in line with the findings, then I think that legislative basis obviously will still stand.  However, as I said, we have not seen an enforcement notice despite it now being some months later but we will look at the scope and the terms of that enforcement notice and react depending on what is in it.<\/p>  <p>  We are very much aware there is a second part to this.  The Data Protection Commission chose to put its investigation, which was started some two years ago, into two parts.

The second part of its investigation is around biometrics and to date we have not received anything from it with regard to that.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the unlawfulness of this, we have a legal basis to do exactly what we are doing.  That is why we are strong in our commitment to continue doing what we are dong.

The new model utilises recent ICT developments that have removed the location constraints of the previous paper-based system.  Those constraints meant that the majority of claim-related activity had to be physically performed within the local Intreo centre.  Under the front office-back office model, the core front office functions in which the majority of staff are engaged, including claim reception and registration, identity verification, employment services, community welfare services and control activity, continue to be performed in local Intreo offices.<\/p>  <p>  Once a claim is registered, however, it can be processed and decided by an appropriately-trained deciding officer in any one of a number of back office units that can be located anywhere in the country.

It also adds significant flexibility to the Department&rsquo;s ability to balance workloads across available resources nationwide and to handle unexpected spikes in demand.

That is an increase of just under 9% and that will increase the annual fuel allowance rate from &euro;630 to &euro;686, which is an increase of &euro;56 for the year.  The annual cost of this increase in the fuel allowance is &euro;21 million and that is funded via a ring-fenced allocation from the approximately &euro;90 million that it is expected will be raised from the carbon tax increase.  This is the largest single allocation and it is directly aimed at protecting our most vulnerable citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, published its report, \"The Economic and Environmental Impacts of Increasing the Irish Carbon Tax\".  This followed its detailed analysis of the impact of increasing carbon tax at various rates.  It included a treatment of the effect on households at each income decile and shows that the increase in the carbon tax of &euro;6 per tonne will cost the poorest households an additional &euro;28.08 per annum, rising to &euro;51.17 per annum for those in the third lowest income decile. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, it is intended that the &euro;56 annual increase in fuel allowance that we have announced will more than compensate the three lowest income deciles, the very people toward whom the fuel allowance is targeted.  We hope this will ensure that the most vulnerable in society are protected from the increased carbon tax.  It is also important to note that while the fuel allowance increases will come into effect from 6 January 2020, the carbon tax increase for home heating fuels will not take effect until May 2020.

Also, any carer currently working less than 18.5 hours per week can avail of the additional hours.<\/p>  <p>  I prioritised this measure in direct response to the carers I have met over the past number of years who have told me that they found the current number of 15 hours to be too restrictive.  An increase to 18.5 hours will accommodate increased participation by carers in work or training to strengthen their connection with the labour force, while also serving the additional purpose of reducing the social alienation that we so often hear is experienced by many carers.<\/p>  <p>  There have been calls to increase the disregard for carer's allowance from carers groups.  In deliberating measures for budget 2020, I included an examination of the disregard for carer's allowance.  In its pre-budget submission, Family Carers Ireland looked for an increase in the disregard for carer's allowance of &euro;117.50 for a single person and &euro;235 for a couple per week.  My Department costed this proposal using the ESRI simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model.  Allowing for income tax and working family payment offsets, net expenditure is estimated to be more than &euro;55 million per year.<\/p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 92% of the current recipients of carer's allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard no matter how big.  The overwhelming majority of carers can, therefore, benefit from the change in the working hours threshold.<\/p>  <p>  The existing income disregard and means test for carer's allowance is also one of the most generous within the social welfare system, not only in Ireland but across the European Union, with the amount of weekly earnings disregarded at &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  At 18.5 hours work per week, this amounts to &euro;36 per hour for a person in a two-person household and &euro;18 per hour in a single-person household.  This indicates that there is significant scope for carers to increase their working hours without impacting their payment.  In fact, only 0.1% of current carer's allowance recipients have means of between &euro;250 and &euro;300 per week and it is highly unlikely that any of them will have their payment reduced as a result of choosing to work additional hours.<\/p>  <p>  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households.  Given the need to target available resources fairly and equitably to those in most need, allowing an increase in the number of hours was the best use of the limited resources available to the Department in the budget.  In this context, I have no plans to change the means test conditions for carer's allowance at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300008#J01900","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1571822100,"counter":59,"content":"<p>In my question, I stated it was an anomaly.

I disagree with the Minister when she states that this will have an impact on very few, given the evidence I have and the evidence the carers are giving.<\/p>  <p>  The carers welcome the increase in hours that they can work outside the home to 18.5 hours but it was not to be done in isolation.  In their submission to and engagement with the Minister, the carers had said that the increase in hours on its own would not be sufficient and there needed to be an increase in the earnings disregard.  The Minister disregarded what they said and the impact will be significant.  It will not impact on 0.1%, as the Minister referenced in her reply.

We had to see how thinly we could spread the money to reach the most people in the current economy.

Is there a way to modify this to allow such persons to claim the carer's credit?  It is reasonable that a person farming on a small scale would also care for an elderly relative.  Someone might have been milking the cows in the morning, taking the children to school, doing a few jobs and coming back again in the evening.  Such persons should be able to claim the carer's credit while they had the equivalent social welfare payment.

I reassure the Deputy that claim processing and the length of time it takes are kept under active review, with additional and targeted attention focused on carer's allowance and disability allowance applications.

The introduction of the total contributions approach, TCA, for establishing the level of entitlement for all new State pension contributory claims was signalled by the then Government in the national pensions framework in 2010.<\/p> <p>At the time it set a target date of 2020 for implementation of the new TCA approach.  More recently, the roadmap for pension reform for the period 2018 to 2023, inclusive, which was launched on a very snowy day last year targeted implementation of the TCA approach from quarter three of 2020.  This is subject to the necessary legislation being enacted and supporting structures and the IT system being in place.   <\/p> <p> Consultation is a very important part of the development and design of the new pension for the next generation.  With this in mind, I launched a public consultation process on the design of the TCA on 28 May 2018, in which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited to participate.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  Shortly afterwards Members of the Oireachtas were invited to a very detailed briefing by my officials in Leinster House.  The consultation process was open for over three months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  The submissions outlined the views of respondents on the issues of most interest to them.  Having carefully examined the outputs of the consultation process, my Department is designing the scheme and I intend to bring a proposal to the Government setting out the design in the near future.  When the Government has agreed to the approach to be taken, I will initiate the work required to introduce this reform.  <\/p> <p> With reference to the State pension age, the purpose of reform in this area is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  If there is no change in State pension age, the proportion of a person's life spent in retirement will increase to levels where current workers will no longer be able to support current pensioners.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension would age be increased gradually to 68 years.  The process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State transition pension.  This measure standardised State pension age for all at 66 years.  It will increase to 67 years on 1 January 2021 and 68 in 2028.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300013#O01500","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571825700,"counter":146,"content":"<p>The proposals brought forward by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government spoke about a total contributions record over a period of 30 years.

Accordingly, although the Low Pay Commission recommended an increase in the national minimum wage of 30 cent to &euro;10.10, it did so on the assumption of an orderly Brexit and acknowledged that the Government might wish to reserve its position in the event that there was a disorderly Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Although we are all optimistic about a deal being ratified, the possibility of a disorderly Brexit is still present; therefore, the economic circumstances that will apply in 2020 continue to be very uncertain.  Nevertheless, the Government accepted the recommendation of the commission but decided to defer a decision on when its recommendation would commence until the nature of Brexit became clearer.  I intend, therefore, to make provision in the Social Welfare Bill to declare the national minimum wage in 2020 in line with the commission's proposals once the situation in respect of Brexit is clarified.  If a Brexit deal is agreed before the end of the year, I expect the national minimum wage to be changed on 1 January 2020 as it was in previous years. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory national minimum wage and the living wage concept not be conflated.

Obviously, we will need to obtain more information and carry out any necessary investigation that may be required.  Everyone's thoughts are with those who have died and their families.  It is a really terrible human tragedy.  We will carry out any investigation that is necessary if it is established that the truck passed through Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On the major boil water notice covering north Dublin and counties Kildare and Meath, the incident has given rise to serious disruption and resulted in more than 600,000 people and many businesses being subject to inconvenience.  The boil water notice covers my constituency and home and I understand it may last for several days.  The Government's concern, first and foremost, is to ensure people's health is protected from any risk as a result of this incident.  We want to see the notice being lifted without undue delay but only as soon as the water supply is deemed to be safe.  Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA are all working to ensure this will happen as quickly as possible and keeping the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Government informed.  The EPA is conducting an investigation to find out exactly what went wrong at the water treatment plant and why.  I am informed that a fault at the plant in Leixlip resulted in water that had not been fully treated entering the distribution network for a period of time on Monday.  Once the fault was detected on Monday evening, the plant was shut down and the fault quickly repaired.  The plant was back brought into full production on Tuesday morning and is now producing treated water in full compliance with water safety requirements.  However, because partially treated water needs to work its way through the entirety of the network and the test results need to show that this has happened, estimates from Irish Water and the EPA suggest it will take approximately 24 to 48 hours for the water to fully flow through the water network.  As the water that did get into the system was chlorinated at all times, the main risk comes from chlorine tolerated microorganisms that could have made it past the treatment systems into the treated water network.  In terms of engagement with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, I do not have the exact timelines, but if I can get them, I will pass them on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300015#Q00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1571826300,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to monitor the position on the access of the container through Irish ports.

This will leave workers and their families in a terrible situation coming up to Christmas.  It will also have a significant knock-on effect on the local economies.<\/p>  <p>  International trade is currently in a downturn due to increased protectionism and a move away from free trade.  Locals have rightly asked the Government what it will do to support the workers now being unemployed.  It will be a real test of the ability of the State and its agencies to react to major job losses.  Unfortunately, there is still a risk of major job losses with an adverse Brexit.  We will be looking closely at how the Government and its agencies cope with Novartis and Molex workers to see how successfully they will be assisted back to work and how problems in those regions can be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach about the Government's analysis of the economy.  The trade war between the United States and China is named as one of the factors that affected Molex, which has laid off workers around the world due to additional tariffs being imposed.  It is extremely worrying that 820 job losses could come out of the blue, unknown to the IDA or the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Is this just unfortunate timing or are other jobs at risk right now?  What research has been done by the Government to understand the effects of changes to international trade on jobs in Ireland?  Can the Taoiseach assure other workers in similar jobs that their positions are stable?<\/p>  <p>  There have been some estimates of job losses following a no-deal Brexit but does the Government have any estimate of job losses due to protectionism, the ongoing trade war and the higher tariffs being imposed on products made in this country?  The World Trade Organization, WTO, permitted the US to impose &euro;6.8 billion of tariffs on European goods at the beginning of this month.  Food and drink products, including household names like Kerrygold and Baileys, now face a 25% tariff in the US.  What analysis has the Government done about how this hostile trading environment will translate into potential job losses in this State and what is the Taoiseach going to do about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300016#R01100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1571826900,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and join with him in expressing my regret at the news that jobs are to be lost at Molex in Shannon and Novartis in Cork.  These are not connected.  One is a pharmaceutical company and the other is in manufacturing and while the IDA had some advanced notice that there may be issues with Novartis, there was no prior awareness of job losses at Molex.  This will be a big blow to both regions, Cork and the mid-west, and our thoughts are very much with the staff today, particularly as we begin the run-in to Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  We have become so used to big job announcements that it is sometimes easy to forget that jobs can also be lost but that can happen, and that has happened in these cases.  On a somewhat reassuring note, the jobs are not to be lost immediately and will be phased over a two-year period, through 2020 and 2021.  That will give people who do not take up early retirement the opportunity to find alternative employment, of which there is much in those regions.<\/p> <p>It will also give us and the IDA an opportunity, perhaps, to get a new investor or owner to come into Molex, in particular, and replace the jobs.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, has cancelled events so as to travel to Shannon this morning, where she is convening a meeting of the enterprise agencies, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, members of the regional enterprise plan committee, the Shannon Chamber of Commerce, the local authority and other local stakeholders.  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss how we can all work together, collectively across Government, State agencies and the private sector, to transition workers to new positions between now and the end of 2020, and what steps we can take to find a new investor for the Molex site.  I want to assure the House that the Government will make every assistance available to the impacted employees in both companies.  That includes benefits such as jobseeker's benefit, the back-to-education allowance for those who may go back to education, the back-to-enterprise allowance for those who may wish to set up their own business, as well as training opportunities and advice on redundancy entitlements and so on.  All of that will be done.<\/p> <p> I appreciate there have been calls for a task force.  However, we already have a regional enterprise plan steering committee, which will be able to take on the role that a task force would have taken on in the past.  We have done specific research on the impact of the recent US tariffs on EU trade and Ireland.  I read it only a few days ago and I am not sure whether I am in a position to share it but if we are, we certainly will.  When it comes to the US trade war, that is much harder to predict because we do not know yet the extent of it, what any tariffs will be or when or how it will end.  It is a statement of the obvious, to which almost everyone in the House will agree, that free trade makes everyone better off in the round.  It creates jobs and wealth and when there are restrictions on free trade through protectionism, it is not good for jobs or wealth.  That is why it has always been the Government's position to be supportive of free trade, which we do, particularly, through our membership of the European Union and the trade deals the European Union makes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300016#R01200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571827500,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I am sure the Taoiseach will acknowledge that many people were surprised by the lack of awareness, of both the Department and the IDA in respect of the announcement of the job losses.

It is consistently one of the worst hospitals in the country in respect of the number of people who have to spend a night on trolleys.  It has got so bad that older people, in particular, are genuinely afraid to go to hospital, knowing about the indignities that await them in what is supposed to be the west's flagship facility.  Over the past three weeks alone, almost 600 sick or injured, worried and vulnerable people have been left lying on trolleys overnight at UHG, and that does not include weekends.  In the first six months of this year, 2,391 people spent more than 24 hours in the UHG emergency department.  Shamefully, more than 850 of them were aged 75 or older, distressed and fearful, having to endure a full 24 hours and more lying on a trolley in the corridors of the emergency department.<\/p>  <p>  It is scandalous that such a fear should exist in this day and age.  I have put forward solutions in the House in the past, to both the Taoiseach and his predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny.  One solution is to locate a minor injuries unit at Merlin Park hospital on the eastern side of the city.  It could take up to 60% of the people currently attending the severely overcrowded emergency department at UHG and deal with them in a fraction of the time it takes now.  Not only would that greatly benefit more seriously ill patients, who would be seen sooner, but it would make the department a joy to work in for those staff who are under such stress at present.  Eleven such injury units are dotted around the country.  I visited the one in County Roscommon, where people are seen, treated and are out the door in less than an hour on average.  Why is there not one in Galway?  When I raised the matter with the Taoiseach in the House previously, he replied that it was a good idea and indicated he would look into it but I have heard nothing from him since.  Why does it take so long to get a new emergency department built?  The last I heard is that it will be another five years or more.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of health investment, as I pointed out in respect of sports capital grants some time ago, it seems the west will always be the poor relation.  Another example is the delay in replacing operating theatres at Merlin Park hospital, which has resulted in a significant spike in the waiting lists for orthopaedic treatment, since leaks were discovered in the roofs of the old theatres a full two years ago.  A sum of &euro;400,000 is needed immediately to finish design and start groundworks on a new modular theatre building, while &euro;9 million will be needed next year to complete the project at Merlin Park hospital.  Will the Taoiseach give a firm commitment that money will be allocated and ring-fenced to complete the urgent project?  Will he give a commitment to speeding up the provision of a new emergency department at UHG?  I also want his commitment to getting the ball rolling with the establishment of a minor injuries unit at Merlin Park hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300017#S01300","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1571827500,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of health services in Galway again.  It is very much acknowledged by the Government that Galway requires additional capacity when it comes to our health service.  It is a growing city and county, and UHG is the medical centre of excellence for the western and Connacht region.  Over the past couple of years, there has been very significant investment in the hospital.  The budget has increased for the past three or four years in a row, there are additional staff and there is also additional bed capacity.  A new 75-bed ward block opened last year, which provides 75 en suite single rooms for patients who need them, including six isolation rooms.  That has resulted in a significant improvement in bed quality and infection control at the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The next development at the hospital will be the new radiation oncology unit and the enabling works for that have started.  In addition, plans are now afoot for another new block, which will house the emergency department and the maternity and paediatric unit.  There are also plans, unfortunately stalled, for a new hospice in the region, with which the Deputy is very familiar.  It did not get planning permission but a new planning application is being developed.  Planning permission has been secured for a new 50-bed block at Portiuncula Hospital.  That will go ahead and, hopefully, it will relieve some pressure on the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  On the minor injuries unit at Merlin Park hospital, the Deputy raised the matter previously.  I said I thought it was a good idea and I still think it is a good idea.  It would not have any impact on trolleys but would mean that people attending with minor injuries would be seen more quickly.  There would be fewer people in the department, therefore, but it would not impact on trolleys in itself.  It is still a good idea, notwithstanding that.  There is such a unit in Cork in the old orthopaedic hospital, where people who have a minor injury can be seen within an hour or two rather than joining a long wait at Cork University Hospital, and there are ones in Smithfield and Loughlinstown in Dublin.  Where they exist, they work well.  Given that Galway is a major population centre, it seems to be an obvious place to have a minor injuries unit.<\/p> <p>I understand a nationwide review of minor injuries units and medical assessment units is under way.  That was a commitment in the programme for Government.  The Minister is waiting on an update, which he will pass on to the Deputy when he has it.<\/p> <p> The position on the emergency department and maternity and paediatric block is as follows: the service scope for all floors has now been agreed; the enabling works packages have been defined along with specific programmes for delivering them; further work is expected to be completed in the coming weeks so that the project can progress to stage 2 of design; and then a submission will be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la with a view to it being considered as a strategic infrastructure development so that it can go through fast-track planning.  If it can do so, a formal planning application will be made right after that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300017#S01500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571828100,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I want to outline the following facts to the House: in the two years since leaks were discovered in the roof of the operating theatre in Merlin Park Hospital, the number of people waiting for orthopaedic treatment in Galway has increased by 42% while the numbers in hospitals in the rest of the country have reduced; the number of people waiting for major orthopaedic operations in Galway has almost doubled; it is up by 86%; and last month, more than 500 posts remained unfilled in hospitals in the Saolta group stretching from Donegal to Galway, waiting for sanction by HSE headquarters through which all approvals must go.  This is contributing to the increase in waiting lists in hospitals in the group which has grown by 11% or more than 10,000 people in the past year.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach correctly said, there are 11 minor injuries units in Ireland, but there is none in Galway, even though three quarters of the 66,000 patients presenting each year at the emergency department in University Hospital Galway are discharged without the need for hospital admission and would be ideal candidates for such a fast-track treatment unit.<\/p>  <p>  These facts speak for themselves.

While in New York I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Johnson, at which we exchanged views on possible means to break the impasse on Brexit.  I have spoken to the Prime Minister on several occasions since.  As the House is aware, I met him in Liverpool on 10 October.

Both Sweden and Denmark reiterated their full support for Ireland in the ongoing Brexit discussions.<\/p>  <p>  I also spoke by phone to both President Tusk and President Juncker about Brexit on 3 October.  Of course, I met each of the EU Heads of State and Government and the institution's Presidents again last week when I attended the European Council in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.  On that occasion we endorsed the revised withdrawal agreement negotiated between the Barnier task force and the UK Government.  We also discussed what we would do in the event of a request for an extension from the United Kingdom.

In the context of the conversations with Presidents Tusk and Junker, it is fitting to wish them well as they move on from the stage.

I am going to use the first group to ask about a matter that was debated at the socialist group meeting I attended last week at which I had the pleasure to meet Edi Rama, the Prime Minister of Albania, and Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of the Republic of North Macedonia.  There was an impassioned plea made by the high level representative, Federica Mogherini, about not closing the door on the applications of these countries and allowing them to progress.  It is quite clear that their accession to the European Union is not imminent.  It is a long way away, but we really need to give people hope and confidence that they are on a journey.  It is really important and a very passionate debate took place on the impact it would have on the Balkans.  It would be unfortunate if people felt the European Union was closing the door on them, particularly after the enormous strides they have taken.  Macedonia has changed its name.  Albania has allowed judges to be vetted by independent panels and Frontex to operate.  We really need to ensure this is reciprocated by a hand of friendship.  I know that there was a very strong rejection by the President of France.

Goal No. 8 commits to promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.  In addition to the economic uncertainties attached to Brexit, there are wider global challenges at play which impact on member states' economies.  For instance, the German economy has contracted for the third quarter this year.  Its central bank has warned that early indicators provide few signs of a sustainable recovery of exports and stabilisation of industry.  Here at home we have discussed the significant job losses in Cork and Shannon.  Political leaders' previous responses to economic contraction and recession were to pause, undermine or roll back fundamental rights and entitlements of workers.  We saw this most recently in the Taoiseach's decision to withhold a much needed increase in the national minimum wage in the recent budget.  The European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC, has called for a new social contract between governments, business and workers and is engaging with political leaders across the EU institutions.  The ETUC's Time For 8 campaign recognises the challenges facing European and global economies by advocating for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, as well as employment and decent work for all.  The right to collective bargaining which still eludes workers here is also woven into the campaign, as well as the economic and social need for the introduction of a living wage.  What, if any, engagement has the Taoiseach had with the ETUC or his counterparts on the aims and objectives of the Time For 8 campaign?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300022#X01300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1571830500,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  We have not made a new impact assessment of the withdrawal agreement agreed to last week, but there have been quite a number of impact assessments made of different hypothetical scenarios.  It may be possible to look at the data and apply them to the revised withdrawal agreement.  We will do so.  What is fair to say is that if the withdrawal agreement is ratified, there will be no significant impact on the economy, at least until the end of the transition phase and implementation period because it is a stand still period during which the United Kingdom as a whole will effectively remain in the customs union and the Single Market.  It will run until the end of 2020, but I think most people are of the view that concluding a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom and having it ratified by nearly 30 parliaments, including some regional parliaments, would be quite a challenge such that we may see the transition or implementation phase extended, as it can be under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, to the end of 2022.  It is very unlikely to have any impact of significance on the economy before then.  Afterwards, what will matter is the nature of the future trading and economic relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  That has to be determined.<\/p>  <p>  If we get through this phase of Brexit, that is, withdrawal, the next phase will be negotiating the economic partnership, the security partnership and the free trade deal with the United Kingdom.  In the joint political declaration the United Kingdom states it wants to have tariff-free, quota-free access to the European Union.  We want to have tariff-free, quota-free access for our farmers and business people and agri-food sector to the United Kingdom.  The European Unions responds that if that is to be the case, we must have agreed minimum standards and a level playing field when it comes to environmental protection, health and safety, workers' rights and all of those things.  That has still to be determined.  Brexit will go on for a very long time.  When we get through the withdrawal phase, the next phase will be the future relationship, which will be just as important to Ireland ,in many ways.  We will have resolved the issues in avoiding a hard border, but we will not have resolved the issues related to east-west trade.  That will be the next phase of negotiations, assuming we get through this phase in the next couple of weeks or even months.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding a decision on an extension, the United Kingdom has formally applied for an extension until the end of January, although the Prime Minister has indicated that he is keen to leave the European Union by the end of October.  Essentially, President Tusk is ringing the various Heads of Government to ask for their views.<\/p> <p>If there is consensus, we can do this by written procedure without having to have another meeting of the European Council.  If there is not a consensus, then we will have to convene another meeting of the European Council, possibly next Monday, maybe even on Friday, to discuss whether to grant an extension to the UK, for how long and under what conditions.  The Irish Government has always said that we want to avoid the risk of no-deal happening either by consequence or accident and that is the approach that will be taken to this.  <\/p> <p> Deputies will recall that the extension that was granted to Prime Minister May was what was called a flexible extension.  Even though the extension was granted to October, it was possible for the UK to leave at any time before that, provided that its Parliament was able to ratify a deal.  That was not done during that period.  I hope that Parliament will now proceed with reasonable speed in concluding this withdrawal agreement.<\/p> <p> On the issue of enlargement raised by Deputy Howlin, we had a very long discussion at the European Council over dinner on whether to open talks with Albania and North Macedonia on their joining the European Union.  Sadly, there was not consensus, which is how we operate.  A few countries took the view that they did not want - or thought it was too soon - to open talks with North Macedonia and Albania.  We agreed to revisit the issue before May of next year.  From Ireland's point of view, I expressed our support for opening accession talks with both Albania and North Macedonia.  I believe both countries, as Deputy Howlin said, have made a lot of progress in recent years and have brought about some very significant reforms.  They were given a legitimate expectation that if they did certain things, talks would begin.  North Macedonia, in particular, was given a legitimate expectation that if it changed its name and settled its dispute with Greece, talks would then open.  While NATO has honoured that commitment, the European Union has not.  I think that is a shame and a mistake.  It will potentially cause reforms to slow down.  It may cause young people who are very much in favour of joining the European Union in Albania and Macedonia to lose hope.  It may cause some political forces in those countries to look elsewhere, perhaps to Turkey or Iran.  That is a major concern.

I did not have any scheduled bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Johnson at the European Council meeting on 19 October but, of course, I did see him along with other EU Heads of State and Government at the Council.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the draft withdrawal agreement reached between the EU and the British Government.  It is a good agreement allowing the UK to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion with a transition period running to the end of 2020, and perhaps as long as 2022, which is very important tor businesses and citizens across the EU and UK.  It also creates a unique solution for Northern Ireland recognising the unique history and geography of Northern Ireland.  It ensures that there is no hard border between North and South, that the all-island economy can continue to develop and it protects the Single Market and our place in it.  There will not be any further changes to the withdrawal agreement agreed between the EU and the UK last week and on both sides, we wish to see the process move forward. <\/p>  <p>  While I would consider the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October to be relatively remote, we nonetheless must continue to prepare for it. <\/p>  <p>  Before the Council meeting, I spoke by phone with Prime Minister Johnson the previous day, 16 October, when we discussed the position at that time.  Previously, I met with Prime Minister Johnson in Cheshire on 10 October.  We had detailed and constructive discussions on the situation at that time, which concentrated on the challenges of customs and consent.  We also discussed the potential to strengthen bilateral relations, including on Northern Ireland.  We agreed to reflect further on our discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them.  Following our discussions, I consulted with the EU task force and the UK Brexit Secretary and I met Michel Barnier the following morning.  I am pleased to state that on foot of those engagements, negotiations got under way between the UK and the EU task force led by Mr. Barnier, which ultimately resulted in the agreement being reached by the EU 27 member states on Thursday, 17 October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300023#Y01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1571831100,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Given the number of questioners, I must insist that Members stick to the allocated time.

In the first instance, there will be a real substantial hardening of the border east-west, which means border and customs infrastructure etc. in the ports of Belfast and Larne, which can become the focal point of protest.  Furthermore, the Taoiseach states that there is no hardening of the North-South Border, which is not true.  It ensures no hardening of the Border between North and South for a period of four years, after which one could have a vote at Stormont and could have a very hard border appear very quickly between North and South.  Finally, and most importantly, the mechanism of consent sets up a recurring time bomb of a sectarian conflict around this vote, every four or eight years, depending on whether it is a simple majority, or it has the majority of both designated nationalists and unionists, according to how he has set this vote up.

The level playing field is not part of the agreement which will be incorporated into the treaty, as it includes areas like workers' rights and wages.

My bags are always packed for Brussels, and packed they are again.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked a hypothetical but very relevant question by Deputy Howlin on what would happen if the withdrawal agreement Bill was amended to allow the UK to enter a customs union with the EU.  It is very much an hypothetical question.  If it were to happen, it would not be done just by an Act of the British Parliament; the UK would have to try to negotiate a customs union with the EU.  It would not, in itself, change the withdrawal agreement concluded last week.<\/p>  <p>  The EU position towards the UK for decades has always been very reasonable, friendly and facilitative.  When the UK asked to join the EU, the EU said \"Yes\".  When the UK voted to stay in the EU, the EU said \"Yes\".  When the UK decided it wanted to opt out of the social chapter, the EU said \"Yes\".  When the UK decided it did not want to be part of the single currency, the EU said \"Yes\".  When the UK said it did not want to be part of the Schengen arrangement, we said \"Yes\".  When the UK said it did not want to be part of some elements of the fourth pillar, we said \"Yes\".  When the UK said it wanted to leave, we said we were really sorry but said \"Yes\".  Therefore, despite what might come across in the British press sometimes, the entire history of the relationship between the EU and the UK has involved the EU saying \"Yes\" and asking whether we could help it, facilitate it and make exceptions for it.  That has been the approach.  It has been a really friendly approach from the EU towards the UK.  We have never tried to force it into anything or to make it stay in the EU.  History says that.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I described the agreement we made last week as a good agreement was because it met our objectives: no hard border between the North and South, and I share Deputy McDonald's assessment of the profound unlikelihood of the people of Northern Ireland ever voting for an Assembly that wanted a hard Border; North&ndash;South co-operation continuing under the Good Friday agreement; the all-island economy continuing to develop; let us not forget the common travel area between Britain and Ireland, which has now been underpinned and strengthened and is really important for many reasons; citizens' rights have been protected in terms of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the financial settlement, which is important; and the guarantee of funding under PEACE II for Northern Ireland and the Border communities.  Obviously, a UK decision to remain within the EU would have been better, or a decision by the UK to stay within the Single Market, but these were not on offer.  Sometimes, the perfect and the very good are the enemy of the good.  This is good; it is not perfect.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of the level playing field, it is absolutely a discussion for the next phase, on the future relationship, when we get to it.  It is important to state there is already a lot of flexibility within the EU on issues such as labour standards.  In the UK, people get much more holiday leave than in most of the rest of the EU.  There are more bank holidays in the UK than in most of the EU.  Pay levels in the UK are much higher than in Bulgaria or Romania, for example.  Actually, in recent decades, the UK has had higher standards and more rights than are required by the EU as the minimum.  Will the UK depart from this?  I hope not.

On Thursday, agreement was reached between the EU and UK negotiators on the terms of a proposed revised withdrawal agreement.  The European Council, when it met, heard from Prime Minister Johnson.  It considered the proposed agreement in a meeting in Article 50 formation, that is, as 27 member states.  It agreed to endorse the revised withdrawal agreement, which allows the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion.  The European Council also approved the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the EU and UK.<\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal agreement fulfils the Government's negotiating objectives.  I hope it will be approved by the UK Parliament and European Parliament, allowing it to enter into force.  We had a substantial exchange on enlargement in which we considered opening accession negotiations with both North Macedonia and Albania.  Many leaders acknowledged the significant steps both countries have taken but there was not unanimity on the matter so we agreed to consider it again in advance of the EU Western Balkans Summit in Zagreb in May.<\/p> <p> We discussed the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which is the Union's budget for the period 2021-28.  Following presentations by the Finnish Presidency on its consultations with member states, we exchanged views on some of the main challenges for the EU budget.  I stressed the Government's view that we need to maintain funding for long-standing and well-functioning programmes like CAP, but also including Horizon 2020, INTERREG and Erasmus+.  I also expressed my support for continuing structural funds and cohesion.  We agreed that the Presidency should produce a negotiating box with figures before our meeting in December.  We also held a discussion with the incoming Commission President, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, who set out her priorities for the next five years.  We formally appointed Ms Christine Lagarde as the new President of the European Central Bank.<\/p> <p> On climate change, we welcomed the outcome of the UN climate action summit.  We also recalled that we would finalise guidance on our long-term strategy on climate change at our meeting in December.  It was agreed that, at this meeting, we set out a long-term European plan to achieve 2030 targets and meet our 2050 carbon-neutral target.<\/p> <p> We discussed the situation in Syria and adopted conclusions condemning the actions of Turkey and noting that member states had decided to halt arms export licensing to Turkey.  We expressed our full solidarity with Cyprus in respect of the illegal Turkish drilling in Cypriot waters.  We stated our full support for all efforts to establish truth, justice and accountability for the victims of the downing of MH17 and their next of kin.<\/p> <p> This was the final scheduled European Council for President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, the Commission President, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, and High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Ms Federica Mogherini.  It was an opportunity to thank them for their outstanding work over the past five years.<\/p> <p> Before the first working session on Thursday, I attended a meeting of the Nordic-Baltic group, where I updated my colleagues on Brexit.  Earlier in the day, I had a bilateral meeting with the newly elected Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Kyriakos Mitsotakis.  In addition to participating in the formal discussions over the course of two days, I engaged informally with many of my EU counterparts and with Presidents Tusk and Juncker on the margins of the meetings, using the opportunity, as I always do, to promote Irish interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300024#Z02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571832300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I reiterate the Taoiseach's remarks about Presidents Tusk and Juncker and the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, and thank them for their work.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a couple of points about the budget discussions.

As others have pointed out, the clear signal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson - the Taoiseach might not have picked up on it, but it is self-evident - is that he wants to move Britain into a competitive space where the depression of environmental and work standards forms part of his strategy.  That is why they are not included in the binding treaty element of the deal.  It is also why the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, TUC, in Britain and all other trade unions in Britain have voiced concerns about the deal.  In terms of our narrow Irish focus and ensuring the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement and a frictionless border, though, it is better than no deal.

Has there been a conversation, be it directly with the European Council President or at the Council meeting, of what the implications of the British leaving will be, be that in a couple of years or in four or five years?  We all hope that there will be a reversal of the departure, but if it happens, what will be the impact on the budget?  The Taoiseach cited countries such as Romania and Bulgaria as being poorer than Britain economically and in terms of, for example, workers' rights.  That is true, and it is one of the reasons we regret the UK deciding to leave the EU.  Those countries have received large development packages as part of their joining the EU.  The loss of funds that might now occur will have to be made up by all member states, including Ireland.  It would be helpful if the Taoiseach could provide the House with an approximate evaluation of what those figures are likely to be so that we could have a realistic understanding of part of the economic effects of the UK's withdrawal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300025#AA00800","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1571832300,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Last week when I raised with the Taoiseach the events in Catalonia, he reiterated his view that the imprisonment of Catalonian leaders was an internal matter for Spain.

The suppression of democracy and the internationally recognised right to self-determination by a very aggressive Spanish state is not simply an internal matter.  If claims that the EU is a group of institutions based on the rule of law that puts democracy and the democratic rights and entitlements of citizens front and centre are to be in any way credible, the Taoiseach cannot persist in saying that this is an internal matter and not comment on it.  Did he use the occasion of the Council meeting to raise the lengthy sentences handed down to the leaders?  Did he speak to Dr. S&aacute;nchez on these matters?

In fact, I am sure she is correct.  I thank her.<\/p><p>Regarding the Common Agricultural Policy, my assessment is that it is possible to ensure that it is fully funded for the next period.  The Commission is proposing a 5% cut.  Our objective is to get that cut reversed.  I am not sure we can achieve that but that is going to be our negotiating objective for the next couple of years as we negotiate the next six-year budget for the EU.  Our best chance of getting CAP fully funded is to reform it, because ultimately this is taxpayers' money.  It is voters' money and it is consumers' money.  I think what they would like to see is farmers, rural development and the regions supported but they would also like to see it connected in some way towards a more green Common Agricultural Policy, one that incentivises farmers and the food industry to reduce emissions, do the right things in terms of biodiversity and other such changes.  I think they are up for it if they are properly remunerated.  The best way of protecting the budget is not to ask for the same amount of money for the same policy but to ask for the same amount, or perhaps even more, for a reformed policy that is greener and more climate-friendly.<\/p><p>In terms of the UK, off the top of my head I think the loss of the budget is about &euro;12 billion a year, which is significant, but that will be somewhat offset by the financial settlement which is &euro;30-something billion paid in over a long period.  Ireland will see a considerable increase in our contributions.  It is linked to GNI and because our economy has grown so much our contributions will grow by a lot, by about 45% in fact, between 2021 and 2027.  That is a big increase in our contributions between 2021 and 2027.  We are going from a country that was a so-called net beneficiary a few years ago to probably the third biggest net contributor <i>per capita<\/i>by the end of that period.  We will start to see that politics seep into Irish debate about how much we are sending to the EU every week.

We began on Thursday by meeting the new President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, and we heard about his priorities for his term.  We then discussed Brexit, first with Prime Minister Johnson, and then in Article 50 format, that is to say, as 27 member states.  Over dinner, we discussed EU enlargement, illegal drilling by Turkey in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone and the recent unilateral military actions taken by Turkey in Syria.  We continued on Friday morning with discussions on the implementation of the EU's strategic agenda, the MFF, which is the EU's six-year budget and climate change.  We also adopted a decision to formally appoint Christine Lagarde as President of the European Central Bank.  Finally, we adopted conclusions reiterating our full support for the efforts to establish truth, justice and accountability for the victims of the downing of MH17 and their next of kin.  We called on all states to co-operate fully with the ongoing investigation.<\/p>  <p>  Immediately before the meeting of the European Council, I attended a meeting of the Nordic-Baltic group, where I briefed my counterparts on the new Brexit agreement, agreed that day.  In her wrap-up remarks, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will focus on enlargement, following a lengthy discussion at the European Council.  She will also report on foreign policy issues, including Turkey's unilateral military action in north-east Syria, which the European Council has condemned for the unacceptable human suffering it is causing.<\/p>  <p>  On Thursday, 17 October, agreement was reached between EU and UK negotiators on the terms of a proposed revised withdrawal agreement.  The European Council, when it met later that day, heard from Prime Minister Johnson.  He spoke in favour of the agreement and expressed his determination to win approval for it in the British Parliament.  We then considered the proposed agreement in a meeting in Article 50 format.  The revised withdrawal agreement fulfils the Government's and the EU's negotiating objectives.  It protects the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU and it includes a fair financial settlement.  Importantly, it ensures that there will be no hard border on this island.  The all-island economy will continue to develop and North-South co-operation, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement, can continue.  The agreement secures the integrity of the Single Market and our place in it.  The common travel area between the UK and Ireland will stay in place, alongside all the reciprocal rights and entitlements.  For these reasons, I was able to recommend endorsement of the revised withdrawal agreement to my European Council colleagues, and the Council did so, unanimously.  The agreement now needs to be ratified by the UK Parliament and by the European Parliament before entering into force.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also approved the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  Ireland wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, especially on trade, in order to minimise the impact on jobs and the economy.  At the same time, it is vital to our economic interests that the EU's Single Market is fully protected.  The actual agreement on a future relationship between the EU and UK will only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country, that is after it leaves the EU.  Michel Barnier deserves our thanks for his achievement in getting the withdrawal agreement and political declaration over the line, indeed on doing it a second time, as does the task force for its exceptional work in recent years.  I also thank President Juncker and the Commission, President Tusk and the Council, and the 26 EU leaders for their unswerving solidarity with Ireland over this period, and for understanding our particular concerns and needs.<\/p>  <p>  As I said in Brussels last week, the last few years have demonstrated that the European Union is a union of nations and of peoples, in which small states, like Ireland, rather than being swallowed up, are respected and protected.  This agreement is also evidence of the strength of European unity, of how much we can achieve when the 27 member states think, work and act together in pursuit of a common objective.  Our meeting also looked to the future.  The President-elect of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen attended throughout the meeting.<\/p> <p>On Friday morning, she presented her priorities for the incoming European Commission.  We had a positive exchange on a wide range of issues of strategic focus for the EU and member states.  These include data, the digital economy, trade, climate change and the EU's geopolitical visibility and voice.  I look forward to working closely with President-elect von der Leyen and her team in the coming years.  Due to the delay in appointing some Commissioners, it is anticipated that she will not take up office until 1 December.<\/p> <p> We exchanged views on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, the EU's six-year budget, beginning with a presentation by the Finnish Presidency.  Among the issues discussed were what the overall level of the budget should be and the breakdown across the main policy headings, as well as financing, including revenues and incentives.  The meeting was a good opportunity to discuss with other leaders our shared priorities for the years ahead and to begin to identify where a landing zone might lie.  As I have said many times, it is essential that the Union has a budget that continues to provide for existing successful policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and Cohesion and Structural Funds.  It should help us to focus on new priorities, including security, migration and climate change.  In no way are these mutually incompatible goals but they are competing priorities.  Ireland is supportive of an increased EU budget, provided it delivers additional value to European citizens and once our core interests are secured.  I argued strongly for maintaining CAP funding as a highly successful policy that contributes to rural development and regional development, ensures Europe has food security and high standards in production, and transfers money from wealthier parts of the European Union to poorer parts.  Many colleagues share my view of a modernised greener CAP that can help us achieve our climate, sustainability and biodiversity objectives.  I will continue to advocate strongly for the CAP and for other long-standing and well-functioning programmes such as Horizon, INTERREG and Erasmus+.  We agreed to ask the Presidency to submit a proposal with figures ahead of the European Council in December.<\/p> <p> We discussed the UN climate action summit and the planning for the next UN climate change conference, which will take place in Santiago de Chile in December.  We need to build on the momentum of the UN summit and to finalise a long-term plan that will help us to achieve our 2030 target and our 2050 target of climate neutrality.  We will return to this issue at the December European Council.<\/p> <p> This was the final scheduled meeting for President Tusk, President Juncker and High Representative Mogherini, so I took the opportunity to thank them on behalf of Ireland for their work over the past five years.  I especially thanked them for the remarkable solidarity for Ireland, which we have enjoyed from all EU institutions throughout the Brexit negotiations.  I had a chance to thank former European Parliament President Antonio Tajani for the same at the European Parliament meeting earlier in the day.  I welcomed Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece, President Gitanas Naus\u0117da of Lithuania and UK Prime Minister Johnson.  All three were attending their first European Council meeting.  It was a significant meeting for Ireland as the European Council endorsed the revised withdrawal agreement and political declaration.<\/p> <p> When Europe acts as one, we can be a truly powerful force for good in the world.  The unity we have seen in the past few years on Brexit provides a guide, a template, and an example of how we can work together as Europe to achieve other noble goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300026#BB01600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571833500,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The main outcome of last week's Council is welcome but it is certainly not something which we should celebrate because it brings closer the finality of the Brexit project.  Brexit is one of the most profoundly regressive and damaging projects for many decades.  It is based on an approach to national sovereignty, rules-based co-operation and the protection of the environment, workers and consumers, which seeks to return Europe to a model of competition that brought nothing but destruction in the past.  We need to be very clear that the principal changes negotiated with the Johnson government in recent weeks are a step backwards, though probably unavoidable given the behaviour of London.  This involves a decisive move towards a long-term hard Brexit and the adoption of a final status for Northern Ireland that is welcome but that has serious uncertainty built into it.  As we see in the crisis that has overtaken the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, uncertainty can have a very negative impact in the long run.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach accepted during Oral Questions a fortnight ago, the proposed deal sets out a framework for the UK to leave both the customs union and the Single Market without any legally enforceable rules on fair competition.  When we first discussed this matter in the House in 2016, this was accepted as the definition of a hard Brexit and it was the worst-case outcome for the overall relationship between the EU and Britain.  In acknowledgement of this, both the Taoiseach and T&aring;naiste repeatedly stated in mid-2017 that the east-west relationship was of paramount importance to them because of the scale of Irish trade involved.  They went so far as to directly criticise those of us who were then talking about special arrangements for Northern Ireland.  The political situation in Westminster remains as fevered as ever and we have no guidance on what might change with this final status discussion.  The votes yesterday and the overall direction of events suggest that this deal is probably as good as the final status will get.<\/p>  <p>  It is hard to see how legally enforceable measures come into place that move away from an free trade agreement hard Brexit or indeed a World Trade Organization, WTO, Brexit either at the end of next year or a couple of years later.  The Brexit fanatics who appear to set the limits for how far the Prime Minister is willing to go have decided that ending all legal and financial connections with the EU after 2020 is their absolute red line so it is hard to see how he will move away from that position.  This being so, we need our Government to publish an updated economic assessment of this new deal and a revised list of actions for helping businesses to cope with the reality of what is on the way.  The belated no-deal preparations of recent months come nowhere near to the systematic long-term action we need to cope with the structural problems, which will now impact businesses trading with Britain, with the permanent increase in costs and loss of competitiveness that will come from increased regulatory compliance and sterling volatility.  The situation is more serious again in the services sector, where existing WTO rules and established models of free trade deals offer little or no comfort for many Irish businesses in respect of market access and charges.  We know now that the British Government does not seek the deep relationship with the EU that can only come from agreeing common rules and external trade policies.  We need to move beyond the short term and address the scale of the challenge that is now evident.<\/p>  <p>  On Northern Ireland, the Taoiseach said last week that the deal replaces the iron-clad, all-weather, bulletproof nature of the previous text with something that includes more risks.  It appears likely that this was the most any Tory Government would agree to but we cannot just ignore the reality of these risks.  It has been reported that the withdrawal agreement bill published on Monday night does not address in any detail how the provisions relating to Northern Ireland are to be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The consent mechanism is the most contentious part and carries with it a major problem, which is that if this is not dealt with now we run the risk of losing much leverage with the British Government.  Northern Irish businesses in the services sector are deeply concerned about what they face in the future.  Their trade with the EU is worth hundreds of millions and is disproportionately focused on areas which are high value and significant employers.  Rather than leave this to some later date to be sorted out or for the British Government to be allowed to use it as a negotiating point in the trade negotiations, this needs to be sorted out now.  As my party has been saying since 2016, we strongly support a special status for Northern Ireland and we reject the idea that this threatens anyone's constitutional protections.  It offers the best of both worlds and a potential to develop a new economic model to break the long-term cycle of underdevelopment and disadvantage in Northern Ireland.  It is a good deal for Northern Ireland and it should be supported.<\/p>  <p>  In early 2015, my party first addressed the issue of Brexit and we have been consistent in our position since then.  We have been clear in supporting a euro-positive agenda and seeking ways of reducing rising tensions particularly with the debate about Northern Ireland.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, at key stages, we also directly contacted EU leaders to emphasise the core national unity with regard to Brexit.  This included on occasion having to reassure them that the Government's claim that it might have to have an election to have a mandate on Brexit was simply partisan posturing by the main Government party.<\/p> <p>It has been one of the most consistent features of the past two years that every time there has been positive Brexit news, Fine Gael starts talking about holding a snap election.  I am sure the Taoiseach would like to acknowledge the role of non-Government parties in ensuring a clear message on Brexit, something which is unique in Europe.  I am sure he would like to join us in acknowledging the work done on the negotiating guidelines early in 2017.  It is a wonderful example of European solidarity that at no stage has there been any question of Europe stepping away from the commitments made early in the process.  I would like to acknowledge the support for Ireland provided by governments from the Renew Europe group.  I also thank Michel Barnier for his remarkable openness to opposition politicians since his appointment in 2016.  A delegation from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs made a visit to Brussels early in the process and had a constructive meeting with Michel Barnier, whereby the Parliament set out the aims and objectives we were pursuing in tandem with the Government.  At different times it was striking how we were easily able to get information in Brussels that our own Government did not make available to us.<\/p> <p> Brexit is nowhere near over.  Even if some way of ratifying the deal is manufactured in the next few weeks, the withdrawal agreement just opens up a new phase of Brexit.  Years more of negotiations will follow.  On Northern Ireland, we need to find a way of stabilising a situation where politics is failing, and we face into a series of votes that could mean that Brexit never leaves the agenda.  We must also stop being one of the countries that resists key EU reforms, especially in the realm of fiscal policy.  We need to reverse the policy evident in recent weeks of being one of the leaders in opposing critical new funding to stabilise the eurozone and help countries when they face the most pressure.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that leaders expressed their opposition to the actions of Turkey in Syria, and in particular the mass displacement and attacks that are ongoing in the Kurdish areas.  The Taoiseach dealt with that matter in his contribution.  It is a genuinely shameful situation where a minority is squeezed between Turkey, Syria and Russia.  The Kurds are among the greatest victims of the dissolution of empires in the 20th century.  Denied basic cultural and human rights in the four new countries they are spread across, they have developed a basic approach, which is inherently more moderate and respectful of rights than that of any other group in the region.  I do not see what we can realistically do for them that will make a major difference at this point, but, at the very least, we must stand with those who speak out against the repression to which they are being subject and to show the countries involved that consequences will flow from their actions.<\/p> <p> I look forward to addressing a few more questions to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, at the conclusion of this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300027#CC00200","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571834100,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Crowe.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that agreement has been reached between the European institutions and Britain.  I will reserve the well-deserved and effusive praise for Michel Barnier and others until the agreement is completely over the line and we have some certainty, but I commend Members on their efforts, including the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, An T&aacute;naiste and others for an exhausting and long journey.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied the agreement will ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.  I am satisfied there will be no veto given in respect of the Irish Brexit protections.  It is important to say however, that there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  No part of Ireland has consented to Brexit.  It is being foisted on the North of Ireland against the express democratic wishes of the people.  When we hear some, at the eleventh hour, reaching for the consent argument, it simply does not float.  Those who have a concern about consent would have ensured at every stage that the rights and entitlements of everybody on the island were articulated and protected.  There is no consent as the position of the people is to remain.  What unionism, or at least a section of political unionism, now seeks is a veto.  We have to manage and mediate our political affairs in a way that is civil, democratic and peaceful and in a way that yields protections for all of our people.  That is our priority.  We have to recognise that the unionist veto, or \"the orange card\" as it was called, has been played for generations but the veto days are over.  That ship has sailed.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear about one thing.  The principle of consent, as hardwired into the Good Friday Agreement, is primarily concerned with the constitutional question - the issue of Irish unity.  That question, to be put by way of referenda, will be answered and consented to by simple majority.  The cross-community consents and provisions for petitions of concern relate to devolved matters only.  The intention of these protections is to protect minority rights.  Brexit is not a devolved matter.  The Brexit protections will be codified in an international treaty.  The Brexit protections are necessary to mitigate the worst of Brexit for the whole of Ireland and not just for the North.  Those who claim this agreement breaches the Good Friday Agreement by refusing the DUP a veto on Brexit protections are simply wrong.  They are dangerously wrong and I invite them to study the agreement again and to reassess their positions.<\/p>  <p>  As a party, Sinn F&eacute;in has worked to defend Irish interests from the worst impacts of Brexit.  Sinn F&eacute;in first made the case for a designated special status for the North within the European Union.  The Oireachtas backed that position by way of a motion in February 2017.  Any deal can only reduce the worst effects of Brexit.  It can only every be a least worst option.  The antics across the water in recent weeks and months have done little to allay people's fears around Brexit.  It echoes the chaos we have witnessed for years.  Westminster is undoubtedly a house of dysfunction and farce.  It is clear that Irish interests will never been taken seriously there.  Those who care about our economy, our peace and our future should be under no illusion about that.  Those who argue for any self-respecting Irish democrat to insert themselves into that mayhem are stretching the boundaries of political sense and reality.  None of us here in this country should underestimate for a second the level of division within parties, between parties and across British society, English society in particular, on the issue of Brexit.  It is sad and alarming to see, but only they can fix that.  We cannot fix that for them but we need a decision from them.<\/p>  <p>  Critically, from our perspective, we need an agreement that delivers for Ireland.  Whatever transpires, there will be significant and ongoing challenges for us.  It should be obvious to everybody in this House that will see an increased and sustained move to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  That is under way.  The example of the DeSouza judgment demonstrates that.  This cannot be tolerated.  The Government must be proactive and staunch in defending our peace agreements.  Ireland's interests in any future trading relationship will have to promoted and protected.  We must strategise for east-west trade and relationships to ensure we get the best economic and political outcomes for our island and for our next door neighbour.  Ultimately, we need to start planning for Irish unity.  I invite those who have their heads stuck in the sand to remove their heads without delay.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address briefly the jailing of Catalan leaders for their alleged roles in the 1 October 2017 Catalan independence referendum.<\/p> <p>The European Union cannot turn its face away from the brutal repression of the Catalan people by the Spanish state.  It is not good enough to say it is an internal matter; it is far from it.  It is a matter that tests the democratic bona fides of the European Union in the most profound and important ways.  The Taoiseach and the Government must be to the forefront in insisting that the jailings be ended and that the European Union use all of its clout and influence to ensure dialogue, not prison, is the solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300028#DD00200","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571834700,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I attended the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly at the weekend and Brexit's long shadow had an impact in the sense that many MPs had to leave early on the first day for a vote that in the end did not happen.  That is an indication of how Brexit is impacting on the relationship between the two islands.  The result of last night's vote in the House of Commons means that the uncertainty will continue.  It is welcome that the Taoiseach has informed Donald Tusk that he believes there should be an extension of the Brexit deadline.  A no-deal Brexit would be devastating and must be avoided at all costs.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that the conclusions of the European Council meeting state the European Union condemned Turkey's unilateral military action in north-east Syria, which is causing unacceptable human suffering and undermining the fight against Da'esh.  The European Union also called on Turkey to end its military action, withdraw its forces and respect international humanitarian law.  We know that Turkey's aim is to occupy the Kurdish majority area and attack the Kurdish-led Syrian democratic forces.  The Turkish Government wants to ethnically cleanse the region.  We have already seen the human rights violations the Turkish army has committed against Kurds in south-east Turkey.  It is clear that its brutal tactics will be replicated in northern Syria with the help of its jihadist proxies.  Videos on social media prove these proxies are involved in summary executions, torture, sexual violence and war crimes.<\/p>  <p>  The Government could do more.  Medical centres and hospitals have been attacked and destroyed by Turkey.  Kurdish civil defence and medical organisations are in desperate need of medical supplies and life-saving equipment.  The Taoiseach should ensure Ireland will respond urgently in a positive way to this plea for assistance and other efforts to tackle the humanitarian crisis caused by Turkish intervention in Syria.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that there is no mention of the imprisonment of nine Catalan political and civic society leaders in the conclusions of the European Council meeting.  I attended the trial and saw at first hand the lack of evidence produced against those convicted.  The jailing of these political prisoners is an affront to democratic values and should be a source of huge concern to democrats and all those who believe in freedom.  We have to talk.  We are supportive of the way forward being through dialogue.  What, therefore, will the Government do to kick-start that dialogue?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the European Council's strong statement condemning Turkey's illegal drilling activities in the Cyprus exclusive economic zone and reaffirming its solidarity with Cyprus.

The United States has placed &euro;6.8 billion worth of tariffs on European trade that will directly affect our exports.  The United States is also engaged in a trade war with China that affects the global supply of components for manufacturing, with knock-on effects for manufacturing in Ireland.  Most countries, including Ireland, are not doing enough to combat climate change.  As we have heard, Turkey is taking aggressive military action in Syria, while Russian interference continues in several eastern European countries. These are very difficult and challenging issues.<\/p>  <p>  As we all know, Brexit has cast a shadow over Ireland for more than three years and it will continue if the United Kingdom does leave the European Union as the issue of the future trading relationship will continue for years to come.  Europe faces a range of other serious geopolitical problems.  I was glad to see the European Council condemn Turkey's aggression in Syria and urge Turkey to end its military action.  I also welcomed the ending of arms sales licensing to Turkey by all member states.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated during Taoiseach's Questions, I deeply regret that the European Council failed to give the positive sign required to Albania and North Macedonia on their future membership of the European Union.  As I said, I met Prime Ministers Edi Rama of Albania and Zoran Zaev of North Macedonia in advance of the European Council.  They are passionate about moving their countries towards EU membership and know that it could take decades.  In one interaction one of the Prime Ministers said to an objecting Prime Minister that that person would have left politics by the time his country became an EU member state and asked them to just let them move on in that journey.  Introducing reforms to embed democracy and the rule of law is a difficult journey for them and they should be given every encouragement.  They have made great strides to strengthen the independence of their courts.  North Macedonia even changed its name.  These are major issues for them.  Therefore, I very much regret the stand taken by France, in particular, but also by the Netherlands and Denmark to block their hopes of beginning the journey towards EU membership.  Beginning the process would have been a sign of strength and confidence.  Instead, countries in the Balkans are turning to Russia and China for assistance, something which will create long-term weaknesses for the European Union.  We should not miss these opportunities.  We cannot take for granted that these populations will remain positively disposed to the European Union forever.  After decades of delay we saw how politics in Turkey moved towards much more hostile nationalism, which manifested recently in the unilateral military action taken against Europe's allies in the Syrian conflict.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also discussed the multi-annual financial framework.  There is very little detail in the published conclusions of the meeting and I know that we are at an early stage, but I understand the figures will be discussed at the December Council.  I am seriously concerned about rumours that the European Union will effectively cut its budget following Brexit by limiting it to 1% of economic output.  That would be a mistake.  Europe has serious problems with low growth in economic output, with low growth in job creation in many European countries as a result.  What it needs above anything else is a stimulus.  There is a limit to how long savers can cope with very low or even negative interest rates.  Europe needs major investment in its infrastructure, even in developed economies such as Germany.  According to expert opinion, we have only ten years to make real progress on climate change according.  That requires significant investment.<\/p>  <p>  Brexiteers argue that the United Kingdom would save money by leaving the European Union because it is what they classify as a net contributor.  This gave rise to the infamous myth that the NHS would gain &euro;350 million one week after Brexit.  In fact, the idea of being a net contributor is a myth.  No member state of the European Union is a net contributor.  On a short-term accounting basis, some countries gain more or less in direct EU spending than they contribute to the EU budget, but every member state gains far more from membership owing to economic growth and trading opportunities than they would if they were outside the block.  This realisation has dawned belatedly on some in the United Kingdom.  The British Government's own estimate is that the British economy may grow more slowly, meaning &euro;2 billion per week less in economic growth than would have occurred if the United Kingdom had remained in the European Union.  The loss of potential economic growth far outstrips the cost of any net contribution it was making to the European Union.  The taxes it would raise from &euro;2 billion worth of economic activity per week would easily surpass the so-called &pound;350 million payment to the EU budget.  Unfortunately, Brexit thinking has not just affected the United Kingdom.  Some other EU member states are also complaining that they, too, are net contributors to the EU budget using the same spurious bookkeeping analysis.<\/p> <p>I am glad that the Taoiseach confirmed this morning that our Government is not one of those arguing for a smaller EU budget into the future.  The size of the EU budget should depend on what we want to achieve and what is most economically efficient in achieving our objectives.  If more spending at EU level raised economic growth and created more jobs, we should be open to a larger budget.  <\/p> <p> In particular, we do not have the time to hesitate when it comes to investing in climate.  My socialist colleague, Frans Timmermans, has been nominated as Vice-President of the European Commission for a green industrial revolution.  If we are serious about transforming our societies to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, we must make major investments now.  Some of those investments are best made through the European institutions such as the EIB, environmental changes to CAP, as the Taoiseach outlined, and some regional funding streams such as LEADER.  I call on the Government to discuss the plans of Frans Timmermans for a green industrial revolution and to take seriously the call for additional funding to achieve real and meaningful action on climate change.<\/p> <p> The European Council has appointed Christine Lagarde as President of the ECB, and I welcome her public commitment to take an evidence-based approach to focus on gender, climate and inequality.  Europe and the eurozone need an economic stimulus and the ECB needs to play a role in facilitating and providing the mechanisms for that.  Recent reports highlight the fact that quantitative easing done under Mario Draghi has reached near maximum capacity in buying bonds issued by member states.  Current rules forbid the ECB to hold more than one third of any member country's bonds.  Ms Lagarde has made a useful suggestion for EU governments to co-operate in a stimulus programme by creating an EU-wide market for investment in climate technology.  I call on the Government to examine those proposals and advance them, if possible.<\/p> <p> The Council also discussed the draft strategic agenda of President-elect of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.  I want to make it clear that the Labour Party does not support the proposal in the President-elect's programme based on what was called the European way of life.  When I met Prime Ministers and party leaders from the European socialist parties, they made it clear that socialist members of the Council and the European Parliament will not vote in favour unless that position and terminology changes.<\/p> <p> I have purposefully made very little comment about Brexit in this contribution because God knows we have made long contributions at other opportunities.  I stress that this was a critical Council meeting for the Brexit discussions.  When I met Michel Barnier last Tuesday, I thanked him personally for the solidarity his team and the EU 27 have shown Ireland.  I also expressed my thanks for that solidarity when I met the European socialist leaders.  The solidarity of the European Union has been critically important during the Brexit negotiations but how we go forward is not yet clear.  Contrary to spin from the Conservative Party, the British Parliament has not approved the deal; it has simply allowed legislation to be debated.  It has just got past the first hurdle.  On the basis of saying the British Parliament has passed the deal, we could say that this Parliament has passed 200 Bills that are now in limbo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300029#EE00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571835300,"counter":417,"content":"<p>That is a good point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300030#FF00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1571835300,"counter":418,"content":"<p>It is a different issue.

The Taoiseach earlier called it \"a good agreement\".  That is not the truth.  The Government is supporting the deal to facilitate Prime Minister Boris Johnson pass what is a bad, neoliberal, race-to-the-bottom Brexit deal.  The Taoiseach even went some way along the path of helping Prime Minister Johnson to present it as a choice between no deal and this deal by suggesting that it might be difficult to have an extension of the process that now seems to be coming.<\/p>  <p>  The deal has even more neoliberal content than the one negotiated by former Prime Minister, Theresa May.  It contains the same sorts of provisions as the May deal in its robust and comprehensive framework for competition and state aid control that prevent undue distortion of trade and competition, effectively seeking to ban left-wing policies such as public investment and nationalisation, but it also goes a step further than the May deal, and is worse for it, in the direction that it points for what follows the transition period.  It is true that what follows is not inevitable and that is open for political debate and, hopefully, a future, Corbyn-led Labour Government could point in a different direction.  The direction in which this deal points is very clear.  It points towards a clear race to the bottom and a free trade agreement to be negotiated for the end of the transition period.  As Mr. Corbyn said, \"The deal fails to enshrine the principle that we keep pace with the EU on environmental standards and protections, putting at risk our current rules, from air pollution standards to chemical safety &ndash; all at a time when we face a climate emergency.\"<\/p>  <p>  I have heard Members say that, in the narrow interests of Ireland, this is a good deal.  I will deal with the impact on the North in a minute but even from the point of view of economics, encouraging this deal is accepting this logic of a race to the bottom which will not stop at the shores of Britain but will expand across the EU and exert downward pressure on consumer rights, labour rights and environmental standards across the EU if we go in this direction.  Let us take the example of a US-UK free trade agreement, which is something that Johnson is obviously promoting.  It is clear that a big ask of the US in such trade negotiations, just as it was in Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations, will be a significant undermining and lowering of food standards.  There will be access for chlorine-washed chicken, hormone-fed beef and ractopamine-fed pork.  If Britain signs up to such an agreement and there are other declining standards of regulation, the refrain that will be heard in Ireland and across the EU will be that we cannot possibly compete with the low standards in Britain and there will be a similar downward pressure on rights and regulations within Ireland and across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  It is particularly on the issue of the North that a much more serious look must be taken at this deal and why I think it is such a bad one.  The argument of the Government is that this deal avoids a hardening of the North-South Border.  It does, and guarantees that temporarily, but that is all.  It ensures a significant hardening of the east-west border that will not be some metaphysical border in the Irish Sea but will comprise border infrastructure at ports in Belfast and Larne.  That infrastructure can become the focal point of protest.  The deal also contains the possibility of a dramatic hardening of the North-South Border in future, come a vote in Stormont in four years, or four years or eight years after that again.  <\/p>  <p>  In the very consent mechanism that it sets up, the deal sets up a recurring sectarian time bomb whereby the question will be deeply sectarianised and will be posed in bluntly sectarian terms by unionist and nationalist parties, asking if citizens would rather have a hard border on the island of Ireland or in the Irish Sea.  It has the potential to have a deeply destabilising and sectarianising effect on the politics of the North and it is for that reason that the only good deal that comes out of this is one that avoids any hardening of borders and does not set in train such a recurring and potentially sectarianised vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300030#FF00400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1571835300,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The one redeeming feature of the deal is that for now, temporarily, it prevents the worst of all possible outcomes, namely a no-deal Brexit and a hard North-South Border.  We all genuinely agree that would be a disaster.  That is a redeeming feature of the deal but it is only a temporary guarantee of that because of the consent mechanism.<\/p> <p>As Deputy Paul Murphy rightly noted, and as socialists have argued since the inception of the Northern agreement, which is similar to the one in Lebanon that led to decades of sectarian conflict, is that it institutionalises sectarianism.  The consent mechanism, therefore, is tied up with a form of institutionalised sectarianism, which means the sectarian poison continues to bubble and every issue is seen through the prism of sectarianism.  That is a problem and it means the guarantee there will not be a hardening of the Border is only temporary.  It will also, potentially, be an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare to administer.<\/p> <p> On this tragic day, it might be worth shifting perspective to one of the other consequences of the sort of Brexit that it may facilitate from the point of view of Boris Johnson but which, to some extent, is already being facilitated by the policies of the European Union.  One of Johnson's major drives in his version of Brexit is racist, xenophobic and anti-immigrant, to prevent the free movement of people and to target and stigmatise immigrants and refugees.  We have observed today the horrific, obscene, human and tragic consequences of fortress Europe policies and of the even worse, more racist and more xenophobic policies of Boris Johnson, which he hopes and believes the deal will facilitate.  It is awful to think that Ireland may have played a role in 39 people suffocating in a lorry that almost certainly travelled through this country.  One has to ask what it is about European immigration policy, or fortress Europe policy, that leads people to take such desperate measures.  It is because the policy is racist.<\/p> <p> The policy feeds into matters such as what is happening in Turkey, where Europe does deals and pays money to a regime such as that of Turkey to keep the immigrants out, and then that regime does what it does to the Kurds and invades northern Syria to drive the Kurds back further.  They are the self-same Kurds who fought an heroic battle against ISIS in Koban&igrave; and other parts of the border area, sacrificed on the large chessboard of imperial intrigue, manipulation and so-called pragmatic politics.  That is what Boris Johnson sees this deal as facilitating.  It is a race to the bottom in respect of racist immigration policy, attacking labour and environmental standards and so on, which the deal effectively facilitates.<\/p> <p> It is not difficult for Europe to pose as a relatively progressive bulwark when the antagonist is Boris Johnson, who is obnoxious, right wing and racist, playing to the lowest common denominator.  As Deputy Paul Murphy noted, much of what Europe is doing in respect of immigration policy can result in tragedy, as can trade deals with Bolsonaro, when we know the guy is slaughtering the rainforests, which produce oxygen for the world and allow us to breathe.  Whether it is trade or German manufacturing because Germany wants to sell cars - whatever it is - it overrides the environmental and climate imperatives, and Europe does rotten deals with Bolsonaro or, more recently, with Trump.<\/p> <p> Of course, no deal and a hard border is the worst-case scenario but let us not dress up the deal, what Johnson represents or Europe's own culpability for many of the horrors throughout Europe and the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300030#FF00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571835900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>There has been much debate and discussion about Brexit in the House since the start of the process.  We have said our bit about the most recent deal and there is much point in going back over it, except to say, as we all know, that it will have a severe impact on us whatever way it is decided to be done.  We will have to work our way through it at some stage in the future.<\/p><p>I will address a couple of other items that were covered at the European Council, namely, climate change, the migrant crisis and the EU's defence policy.  I understand that the European Council welcomed the outcome of the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 on ambition, action and solidarity and is determined that the EU will &ldquo;continue to lead the way in a socially fair and just green transition in the implementation of the Paris Agreement&rdquo;.  There are some contradictions, however, between its proposals and its actions, which seems to be common in politics.  There is often a big difference between what is said and what is done.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, for example, has turned on its commitment to divest EU investments in fossil fuel companies, particularly gas companies, due to intense last-minute lobbying.<\/p><p>According to the non-governmental organisation, Oil Change International, this delay tactic is a direct result of Germany and the European Commission pushing to add more fossil fuels, particularly gas, back into energy policy and is a worrying trend that flows in opposition to the sense of urgency for which millions of climate strikers are calling in response to climate change.  What does it say about EU&rsquo;s commitments to climate action if it caves in to the interests of the oil and gas industry?  It sounds familiar.  We must tackle the EU-wide notion that gas is a transitional fuel and its central role in energy policy.  We need to be more ambitious if we are to tackle climate change.<\/p><p>There are widespread divisions on how to go about tackling climate change.  While Germany wants gas to have a central role in the transition, Poland and Hungary are among a handful of countries that oppose the setting of an EU-wide zero-carbon target by 2050.  I am interested to know to what representations Ireland has made in respect of the EU&rsquo;s energy policy in the context of climate change, considering Ireland&rsquo;s own recent divestment from fossil fuel companies, as part of my Fossil Fuel Divestment Act, and the fact that the EIB is owned by EU member states.  We are a co-owner of the bank and it would be interesting to see what role or input we had in the decisions, if we bothered to have any.  Unfortunately, however, I suspect we may not have had any say in the matter.<\/p><p>The EU stated at the Council meeting that it &ldquo;remains engaged in its efforts towards effectively addressing the serious humanitarian and refugee crisis in the light of evolving needs, including by supporting those Member States that are facing the most serious challenges in terms of migratory flows in the Eastern Mediterranean.&rdquo;  The EU is failing, however, to resolve diplomatically the humanitarian crisis that has become so inhumane that on the Greek islands, a total of 28,000 refugees are being held in island camps intended for a maximum of 10,000, while 12,000 people reside in the Moria camp on Lesbos, designed for only 3,000 people.  While migrant arrivals in Europe have declined, so too has co-operation and responsibility sharing within the EU.  The migrant crisis issue is directly related to that of climate change, given that many of the migrants are climate migrants moving from areas of severe climate impact to seek refuge and resources.  Our inaction on the climate will feed into the refugee crisis and we have to accept that now if we are to have any chance of tackling it.  Ireland has to step up to the mark, lead the charge at a European level and tell European leaders that it is what we have to do.<\/p><p>EU member states have drastically reduced their dedication to search and rescue operations and seem to take on informal, <i>ad hoc<\/i>initiatives to deal with migration that have little transparency, as seen in its disembarkation arrangements and the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, which involves the sending back of migrants to north Africa where many end up in camps, tortured or imprisoned.  Meanwhile, EU foreign policy insists on reform in North Africa yet remains fickle in its own international commitments and obligations and even engages in counterproductive migration practices.  We need to normalise the idea of migration to Europe, and to promote inclusion through policies throughout member states and with third countries such as Turkey and those in north Africa.  Only then will we address migration in a humane and sustainable way while also addressing the tide of right-wing, xenophobic narratives sweeping through EU states.  Part of that is our climate action commitment, which is the only way we can deal with the issue properly.  I had intended to talk about EU militarisation but as I have only a few seconds remaining, I will leave that to my colleague. <\/p> <p>The militarisation agenda could take up considerable time.  I am very concerned about the Government's role in that.  I believe it will go down the road of supporting a European army, which is very worrying. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300031#GG00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571836500,"counter":424,"content":"<p>My colleague used the word \"normalise\".  If we are seriously interested in bringing peace to the world, the best way to ensure we do not have war would be for the Council to put on its agenda the 17 sustainable developments goals, including, zero hunger, no poverty, quality education, affordable and clean energy, water, and others.  I do not have the time to read them.  If that was on any Council agenda, I would rejoice and say we were beginning to make progress and we were seriously interested in a Europe that is humane and not interested in building up its own borders.  However, what we are getting is fortress Europe, as the Minister of State and I know.  Language is just being used to confuse and hide that.<\/p>  <p>  On a day 39 people, including one child, were found dead in a container, it is time to reflect on our policy as part of Europe.  I will refer to the number of deaths per year.  In 2014, a total of 3,162 people drowned in the Mediterranean Sea simply looking for a better life.  In 2015 it was 3,522.  In 2016 it was 3,780.  In 2017, a total of 2,843 people drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.  Last year 1,971 people drowned and so far this year 1,078 people have died.  The only positive is that the numbers have reduced.<\/p>  <p>  However, it must be remembered that while we are going off to the Mediterranean to take in the sun, people are drowning in that supposedly blue sea.  The numbers have reduced because of the policies we have pursued by paying Turkey &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion to take in refugees, while at the same time the Council meeting the Taoiseach attended condemned Turkey's unilateral military action in north east Syria.  It also condemned Turkey's illegal drilling activities in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone.  Although the EU condemns Turkey, it continues to do business with it.  We have allowed Turkey a free hand with the Kurds, as my colleagues said.<\/p>  <p>  What does language mean at the end of the day?  As a female politician and a human being, I want to focus on the people who are losing their lives directly  because to the policies being implemented in our name.  My colleague mentioned militarisation.  Without doubt the militarisation of Europe is going fully ahead in the guise of beautiful language: protecting our borders and protecting our way of life as if our way of life was in any way more important than the way of life of those people who have been driven from their homes by wars in which we are complicit.  An airport in this country is being used in those wars in which people are condemned to death or forced to leave their countries and drown on route.  Those are the policies being pursued in our name.  When the Taoiseach comes back and we have an opportunity to look at this, we have a duty to stand up and say, \"Please do not do this in our name.  Please begin to look at what is happening.\"<\/p>  <p>  The EU has become a champion of the military industry.  We are committed to increasing substantially our defence budgets.  Our neutral country of approximately 5 million people is going to increase its military and defence budget at a time 10,500 people are homeless and all the other problems Deputies outline repeatedly in the House.  Just 10% of global military spending would be enough to provide free equitable quality education as per the fourth sustainable development goal.  Eradicating poverty, the second sustainable goal, and the third could be accomplished with just another 10% of the military budget.  All of the sustainable development goals could be met with just under half of the world's military budget.<\/p>  <p>  This neutral country does not look at these figures and say that it should not happen in our name.  Instead, we go across to a Council meeting and we are happy with a page like the one I am holding, which makes a nonsense of the English language, turns it on its head and makes us immune to the deaths in the Mediterranean Sea.  As the number of deaths in the sea thankfully decreases, clearly the numbers are increasing in containers Greece or in the other places where there are camps, yet we are paying &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion to other people to deal with the problems our policy has created.  The Minister of State and the Taoiseach are not doing it in my name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300032#HH00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1571836500,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The United Kingdom has decided that its future lies in diverging from the EU to strike a lone path and to leave a club rather than trying to fix the difficulties it has from within.  However, how much divergence is the UK looking for and how quickly does it want to introduce that divergence?  Ireland, on the other hand, has decided that its future lies in converging with the EU and becoming a more integral part of the EU.  We all know we have differences over how EU laws are applied and interpreted, but Ireland has decided that its future is much more secure in converging with the EU and trying to sort those problems out internally.<\/p>  <p>  What type of Brexit does the UK want?  It is now realising it is difficult to untangle itself from an agreement it entered into 50 years ago.  Unfortunately, the debate at the time of the Brexit referendum never addressed the core issues that are now the subject of debate.  The Brexit referendum debate took place in very simplistic terms, but we now realise that some very complex issues need to be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  On the length of any extension that the EU might offer, the UK missed two deadlines in March and October.  We should offer the UK a prolonged extension for at least nine months, which would allow it to sort out its domestic political issues.  It would allow it to debate the withdrawal agreement in a reasonable manner and not have it rushed through.  It would allow it to hold an election, which will most likely be held in the next three months.  It would allow it to hold a referendum if necessary.  It should be given time and space and not just a short extension; it should be given a long extension.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit is a process and not an end in itself.  Comparing it to the Grand National, which has 30 fences, I think we are at the third fence.  We have not reached Becher's Brook for the first time yet.  We have not even started to look at the future relationship that the UK will have with the EU.  It is a very long process and we need to give the UK the opportunity to have time to do it properly.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit fatigue is setting in and leading to uncertainty over investment, economic activity and employment in Ireland.  This fatigue is very dangerous.  The EU is now having difficulty progressing its own issues; it is being distracted substantially by Brexit.  An EU-US trade war is developing and Brexit is distracting Europe from dealing with such issues.  We also need to examine how a common security policy will be developed should the UK leave the EU.  When fatigue sets in, logical argument becomes much more difficult to make.<\/p>  <p>  In County Clare, Molex has announced up to 500 job losses in the next 16 months and job losses have also been announced in Novartis in Cork.  While I do not believe Brexit was responsible for those job losses, it will make it much more difficult to find replacement industries.  That demonstrates the uncertainty over employment and investment.<\/p> <p>We also have to consider the fragile peace on this island.  None of this was considered in the debate held prior to the Brexit referendum.  There has been an attempt to prevent a gradient across the Border concerning trade, tariffs, regulation, standards and citizens' rights.  A gradient across the Border in these areas would put substantial pressure on peace and it is very substantial.  All of these things feed into the discussion.  We are concentrating a lot on trade and tariffs, but huge divergence is developing in the area of standards and regulation.  This will affect the recognition of qualifications and standards throughout industry.  There will also be increased political divergence.  The gradient across the political divide will increase, with the result depending on what kind of Brexit occurs.  It is extremely important that people in the United Kingdom who are now realising the difficulties presented by Brexit and seeing problems that they never explored before see that these difficulties and problems have to be dealt with in a very logical and calm manner.  An extension of three months will be too short.  We need to give the United Kingdom a prolonged extension to allow it to work through these difficulties and problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300032#HH00300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571837100,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for facilitating these statements.  I start by commending all Ministers and civil servants who have been involved in what has been a herculean task, not just in recent months but in the past two or three years.  During that time Brexit has dominated European discourse and also discourse here.  I would never underestimate the amount of time, energy and goodwill that has been expended in that regard.  I also express my concern that so many domestic issues have been sidelined, if not neglected, because of the time, attention and energy devoted to Brexit.  I do not believe for one moment that Brexit should be regarded as cover for the Government's failures in so many domestic areas.  Having said that, I recognise all of the work done and the really strong commitment of everyone involved to getting the best deal for the country.<\/p>  <p>  I have to express some concerns.  The T&aacute;naiste has been very good at providing briefings for Opposition leaders and spokespersons in recent times.  It was unfortunate when news of the deal broke last week that I received a brief phone call but no briefing.  I am sure others were in the same position.  My assumption was that there would be a substantive briefing on the issue the following day.  Unfortunately, that was not the case; therefore, we did not have any opportunity to tease out some of the aspects of the draft deal.  That puts many of us at a disadvantage and I will raise some concerns about it today.<\/p>  <p>  Several big questions were raised in the past few weeks.  There was massive concentration on whether a draft deal would get through the House of Commons and what the numbers there were.  Will the deal be passed and become law and can this be done within a reasonable period of time?  The other big question was what would the DUP's reaction be.  These two questions have dominated everything.  The question that has not been asked in the last week is whether this is a good deal for Ireland.  There has been cross-party agreement on it and we have all fully supported the Government in its efforts in that regard.  However, whether the deal on the table is actually in Ireland's interests is not clear.  That is not to underestimate for one moment the importance of reaching a deal and recognising the best deal we can achieve.  Having said that, there are serious questions marks over the deal before us, not least of which is the fact that although everybody has been talking for the last two years about the importance of the backstop as an insurance policy to safeguard this country's interests, it was dropped last week, to which very little attention has been paid.  The arrangement that will apparently replace the backstop is very unusual and could be described as convoluted.  I have not yet seen anybody from the Government or at EU level explain how this convoluted arrangement will work.<\/p>  <p>  We have been told that the North will still be part of the United Kingdom's customs regime.  We have also been told that it will be aligned with the Single Market.  These two statements seem to be contradictory and nobody has spelled out what it actually means.  These words and descriptions are being trotted out without explanation of how they will work.  I find it hard to understand.  Perhaps somebody else can explain how it will work.  There are other situations where there is a soft border between two authorities.  It can work reasonably well where there is an understanding between them.  However, what is proposed is a border in the Irish Sea, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where the two authorities are both UK authorities.  Where are the checks and balances?  Who will oversee the operation of that border in the Irish Sea?  As I find it very hard to understand, I ask the Minister to explain it to us.  Who will oversee what is being termed as \"alignment\" with the rules of the Single Market?  We are talking about a third party that will potentially oversee or police these arrangements.  Who will that third party be?  The agreement includes talk about a working group.  How will it work?  How can an EU authority have a policing role between two regions of the United Kingdom?  <\/p>  <p>  This is an especially important question from Ireland's point of view.  Until very recently we were being told that protecting the integrity of the Single Market was absolutely paramount.  It is paramount to the European Union, but it is also paramount to Ireland's interests because our exports depend on the confidence of other EU member states.  We want them to buy our exports with the assurance that the rules of the Single Market apply.  One of the issues on the table leading up to this agreement was the importance of protecting the integrity of the Single Market for our own welfare in order that we would not have a situation where potentially inferior goods could travel from the North to the South and affect confidence in Irish goods.  Given that there is to be no hard border and that the backstop is gone, how do we protect against this happening?<\/p> <p>Given that there is to be no hard border and given that the backstop is now gone, how do we protect against that?  The example of the proverbial chlorinated chicken is especially relevant in the context of a UK which is clearly intent on a race to the bottom in terms of quality standards.  If a load of chlorinated chicken comes into the UK from the US, what will be the mechanism for ensuring that does not travel to Northern Ireland and come to the South?  Confidence in our exports is very much dependent on what happens in the Irish Sea.  There is little or no detail available on that.  That concerns me.  I would like to hear the Minister of State tease that out.  How will the policing of that arrangement work out, who will do it and how can we be assured that inferior goods will not get onto the island of Ireland and make their way into the South?  Other EU states gave warnings during the negotiations that they needed an absolute assurance that Irish goods will have the full protection and will be subject to the full rigour of the Single Market.  My concern is that rigour and protection may be watered down.  Can the Minister of State please assure me that is not the case?<\/p> <p> I have a concern about the political arrangements in the North in respect of consent.  I do not believe that a situation that is up for review every four years is in the interests of Northern Ireland.  That creates ongoing uncertainty and political advantage for interests which may look to collapse the assembly, if it does get up and running again, but also that kind of uncertainty is not good for business confidence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300033#JJ00200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571837700,"counter":429,"content":"<p>There is provision now for questions and answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300034#KK00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1571837700,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I welcome the discussion at the European Council meeting of the strategic addenda, the next institutional cycle 2021-27 and the emphasis on protecting citizens and freedoms, developing a strong and vibrant economic base, building a climate neutral, green, fair and social Europe and promoting European interests and values on a global stage.

On Deputy Haughey's question regarding the enlargement discussion, I was very disappointed that not only the European Council but the General Affairs Council had difficulty reaching a unanimous decision to open up accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania.  I was particularly disappointed because we had this same discussion last June, where we set out parameters for both countries to make adjustments to implement new reforms.  I believe they implemented those reforms, in particular in the case of North Macedonia through the implementation of the historic changing of name in the Prespa Agreement.  While there are significant political challenges in Albania, it is also implemented changes or a range of reforms such that we should have set out a straightforward pathway for it in terms of this process.  The opening up of accession negotiations does not mean they will become members in the next year or two.  It took a decade for Ireland to become a member.  The road ahead is long.  As I said, I was disappointed that we could not open the accession negotiations, which I think reflects badly on us as a Union.  We made a commitment and it is up to us to fulfil that commitment.  My understanding is that this matter will be brought before the summit in Zurich next year, which means it would have to be on the agenda of the European Council in December, or at the latest, March next year.  I sincerely hope that we can get to that stage.  I understand that member states have difficulties and they have their reasons for not allowing this process to open up, but as we gave a commitment last year and we should have lived up to it.  I sincerely hope that we can do so in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to climate change, I cannot say for how long it was discussed at the European Council but it was addressed.  It was also addressed at the General Affairs Council, where I spoke along with my European colleagues.  We outlined that we needed to build on the momentum that was created at the UN General Assembly, the climate summit, and that we need to ensure that the new European Commissioners and the President, Ursula von der Leyen, set out a clear directive for a long-term strategy regarding our climate change objectives and goals.  My understanding is that the matter will come back to the European Council in December and that there will be a lengthy discussion on it.  From a Government point of view, we are very much engaged in reaching our own targets by reducing our overall emissions by 30% by 2030.  We are committed to the climate neutrality agenda for 2050, which we are doing by way of implementing the cross-governmental plan that is being put in place, which was worked on by all Members for over a year.  We are ambitious, but from a European point of view, it is up to us to set an ambitious agenda in the hope that other larger contributors will follow suit.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Crowe's question regarding the timeline for the EU Commission decision, I expect it in the coming days.  I cannot give an exact timeline, but I hope that we will have some response before the weekend.  Obviously, we need to know what is happening next given that tomorrow week is 31 October.  While the threat of a no deal has severely reduced in the past few days, it still remains.  From our point of view, we have always been very clear that if an extension was sought by the UK, we would look on it favourably, which has been the case.  The Taoiseach spoke with President Tusk this morning and relayed that sentiment to him.  The UK has asked for an extension until the end of January.  Our view would be that it should be approved but I cannot speak for other member states as I do not know what conversations they have been having with President Tusk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300035#LL00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1571838300,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Is a meeting required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300035#LL00300","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1571838300,"counter":436,"content":"<p>My understanding is that legally they do not have to meet and that this can be addressed by way of letter but whether other member states might request a meeting or a summit has yet to be determined.  There may be a meeting between now and next Thursday.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Catalonia, I do not know if the Taoiseach raised this issue.  I am sure that he has had conversations with his colleague in Spain and with other leaders.  We had statements in the House last night on this issue.  This is an important matter.  We are concerned about what is happening in Spain but we must, and will, always respect the constitutional and territorial integrity of Spain.  We need to ensure that anything that happens, be it in Spain or Catalonia, is determined by their own citizens through their own institutions and in keeping with the rule of law.  I have no doubt that in any conversations the Taoiseach may have had on the issue, he will have reiterated these sentiments.  <\/p>  <p>  On the migrants issue, I find this quite upsetting.  Where anybody dies in such a manner, it is a failure of all of us.  It is an extremely frustrating conversation that I have been having with my colleagues over the past two years when it arises at the General Affairs Council.  We do, and want to, support any mechanisms that are put in place.  As a country, we are not to the forefront like Greece, Spain and Italy but we have a role to play.  We have a duty to ensure that our voices are heard such that where there are unfair practices, such that people are dying in this manner, we speak up and condemn it as a failure on all of our parts.  It is important that as a Union we work together to ensure that those who are geographically at the forefront of this are supported.  As a country, we have tried to do this through Operation Sophia and by opting-in to taking 4,000 migrants although we are not at that number yet.  We will continue, where we can, to take in as many as we can.<\/p>  <p>  On the particular issue, my understanding is that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his officials are engaging with officials in the UK to determine what happened.  My understanding is that the migrants travelled through Ireland but that has not been confirmed.

From our point of view, no counter-proposals or conditions were expressed in the Taoiseach's conversation with Donald Tusk but again, I can only speak for us.  I cannot speak for other member states or the conversations they may have been having throughout the morning and today.  On the references to a front stop and a backstop; it is on the basis that the backstop was always going to be there.  It was the essential third element of the three proposals, the first and foremost being a future trading relationship that meant it would never come into force, the second being an alternative mechanism and the third being the backstop.  It was always only a last resort, there \"unless and until\".  This is why the question arises as to why have we now changed the backstop and allowed it move into something different.  We have always said that if the number two position, the alternative mechanism, is there, we would be willing to accept that instead of the backstop.  The backstop as it is currently being proposed in terms of this new deal is something that would come into play immediately after the transition period.  It would not be something that would be there \"unless and until\".  That may be why it is being referred to now as the front stop.<\/p>  <p>  On protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Deputy Shortall's previous questions as to how this will work, obviously Northern Ireland will remain fully aligned in terms of the Single Market with goods, not just live animals or plants but in all manufacturing goods, which means they will remain aligned in upholding the rules, regulations and standards.  This will be overseen by the various bodies and by the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  In terms of the customs union, the Deputy is right.  They will leave the EU customs union and they will remain part of the UK's customs union.  There will, however, be a special arrangement specifically for Northern Ireland.  What separates this and where it is important is that when determining goods moving from Northern Ireland into the rest of the UK, obviously there is no difference there, that is, between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.  However, for goods moving from mainland UK into Northern Ireland, there will have to be a determination as to whether they are destined solely for Northern Ireland or are destined beyond that into Ireland or the Single Market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300036#MM00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1571838900,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Who will police that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300036#MM00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1571838900,"counter":442,"content":"<p>At the moment what we have is a minimal amount of checks in the ports and airports in Northern Ireland.

It is important to say that from our point of view and, importantly, from the Commission's point of view, neither the Commission nor other member states will agree to any new negotiation or deal that would in any way reduce the integrity of the Single Market or jeopardise us.  Any mechanism that is put in place will have to ensure that it is protected.  That is extremely important from our point of view but also for the other EU 26 member states.  There will also be something of a rebate scheme, again depending on whether a good is destined for Northern Ireland or further afield.

While there is an opportunity for an extension of four years at the end of the transition period, within that there is an opportunity to extend it to eight years.  While the initial vote is a simple majority, which will not require cross-community support, if there is cross-community support of over 40% within each community within that vote itself, it can then be extended to eight years, which provides a much longer period and greater clarity for communities in the North.  This addresses any suggestion that the backstop or any new deal of its kind is undemocratic, that people in Northern Ireland would be kept in or removed from any setting, either in the Single Market or the customs union, against their own will.  This clearly deals with that issue and very much brings this back to people in Northern Ireland and to their representatives.  Obviously the assembly has not been up and running for some time now, which begs the question as to where this would be determined if the assembly is not sitting.  It can be addressed through a gathering of the elected representatives.  It does not have to be the assembly.

I think the question was asked about funding.  We currently do provide support, assistance and aid to those in Syria.  However, we very clearly said that any areas or any individuals that were involved in the horrendous attacks that have been taking place in recent weeks will not be receiving that support.  We also have made sure that sanctions have been imposed on Turkey.  This was first put in place in terms of their drilling in Cypriot waters but this obviously has not prevented them from continuing what they have been doing.  We have unanimously condemned what has happened in Syria, in particular in respect of the Kurds, who have been left in a very difficult and unacceptable situation.

Many of the workers have been employed in Molex for 20 years or more and are distraught at the news.  They face an uncertain future.  These dedicated workers must be rewarded with a fair redundancy package that firmly recognises their length of service with this profitable global company.

It was hugely significant that all of the stakeholders were present - IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the local authority, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Shannon Group, the regional skills forum, the university and LIT.  There is a willingness on their part to help the workforce.  Last night I called for the establishment of a task force.

As everyone is well aware, Shannon is located very close to Limerick city, from where many of the workers involved come.  Molex has delivered a number of good jobs for a huge number of years, with generations of families working in the industry.  There are also spin-off companies which are dependent on Molex.  My sympathy also extends to the employees of Novartis in County Cork.  It is devastating news for the workers after the recent job losses, particularly in Roche and at Moneypoint, another big hit for the mid-west region.  This is the worst number of job losses the mid-west has seen since Dell closed its manufacturing plant ten years ago.  Some of the same workers are now caught up in the new round of redundancies.  Will the Minister indicate if there are European funds that can be accessed to retrain and up-skill to help the workers affected by the job losses announced yesterday to find new employment, especially those in Molex?  I am aware that in the aftermath of the Dell factory closure European funds were available, but not all of the money was drawn down to help the workers.  The available funds must be drawn down and everything must be done to ensure this will happen.  The required skills are available to enable it to happen.  A number of years ago I was in Brussels when I was informed that Ireland was particularly bad at drawing down funding that was available, if it wanted to access it.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential that the unions be involved in the discussions that will take place in the next number of weeks.  Will the Minister inform the D&aacute;il if she has met the union representatives and can she commit to ensuring they will be involved in all future discussions?  The workers in counties Clare, Limerick and Cork do not want to hear any express of sympathy today; rather, they want to hear what the Minister's clear plan is and how the Government will help them.  Will the Minister inform the House if she has spoken to IDA Ireland to ask it to focus on finding other businesses to locate in the Shannon free zone which may help to alleviate the effect of some of the job losses?  Will the Minister outline the supports the Government and the social protection services will be putting in place for the hundreds of workers affected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300037#TT00600","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1571839500,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.<\/p>  <p>  The announcement yesterday by Molex that it was to close its facility in Shannon was deeply disappointing.  I understand fully how important an employer the company has been and the role it has played in supporting jobs and enterprise in the mid-west since 1971.  Of course, our immediate concern is for the workers and their families who are impacted on by the announcement.  Many of the workers have been with Molex for many years, which makes the news all the more difficult.  The Government is, therefore, determined to act as swiftly as possible to address the closure and help to mitigate, as much as it can, the consequences for the workers and the Shannon region. <\/p>  <p>  I spoke to the CEO of Molex yesterday about the announcement to see if there was any alternative and he assured me that the decision could not be changed.  I travelled to Shannon this morning, together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Breen -  Deputy Carey was also present, with other local representatives - to convene a meeting with representatives from the State's enterprise agencies, Departments, Clare County Council, third level institutions and the local business community to help to determine how best we could respond.  Our discussions were an important first step in responding to the announcement.  The main priority for all involved is to address the short-term needs of the workers impacted on and make every State support available to them.  The supports will include assisting the workers in finding alternative employment and helping them to re-skill to ensure they will do so.  IDA Ireland will also be marketing the building to try to ensure another business will be established in it.  Looking further ahead, we need, as was agreed collectively this morning, to make sure we create new opportunities in the mid-west region that will help to offset many of the job losses.  The mid-west regional enterprise plan which was launched earlier this year wilt be a critical tool in that respect.  It was also encouraging to learn more about the skills of the Molex employees. I am confident that these skills will be in demand from other employers in the area. <\/p>  <p>  While the news is a significant blow for Shannon and the wider area, it is important to say that mid-west region continues to provide a very attractive offering for multinational and indigenous enterprises.  The region has seen significant investment in the last three years and key employers in the region include many large-scale manufacturing employers such as Beckton, Dickinson, Edwards Lifesciences, Analog Devices, Johnson and Johnson, Regeneron, Stryker and Zimmer.  The overall trend in job creation in Ireland - it is important to emphasise this point - remains very positive.  <\/p>  <p>  As difficult as it may be to appreciate now, we have reason to be confident that we will find new investment and opportunities for the employees of Molex.  The Shannon site will not close fully until the end of 2020.  In the meantime, I assure the Deputies that it will be an absolute priority for the Government to help the workers to transition into new jobs.  What we are doing following meeting this morning is setting up a core team of key people who will co-ordinate the response locally.  Deputy Quinlivan mentioned European funds.  A contributor at the meeting, at which 30 people were present from all of the different agencies involved, said the one thing one should not do was to rush in to make an application.  If one is to be successful in obtaining European funds, one needs to identify the skill set required, find out exactly what one wants to do and the application will then need to be made.  The Deputy is correct in saying the money available was not drawn down fully the last time an application was made.  That was because it was a knee-jerk reaction.  It is important, therefore, that we look at this in the whole, make the right application and receive all possible support from the European Globalisation Fund to ensure the workers will receive the right training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300037#TT00700","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1571839500,"counter":460,"content":"<p>It is good to hear the Minister say this will be an absolute priority for the Government because it is a huge blow to County Clare, Shannon in particular.

At the meeting this morning, however, it was very positive to learn there are many employers looking for the skill set in question.  They will be having a jobs fair where potential employees can find out what jobs are available.  There are many highly skilled workers in Molex.  The highly skilled workforce is a great asset to potential investors.  Acquiring a fully trained and highly skilled pool of talent is not always easy.  The talent is available and the employees' skills will be needed in other companies.  We heard that very clearly this morning.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting I convened today was a strong statement of intent by the Government, key stakeholders and local business community to the effect that we will not allow the closure to reverse the progress made in County Clare and the rest of the region over many years.

Many of those workers rely on the wage packet to pay their mortgage.  Many households have not one Novartis wage packet coming into the house but two.  Sometimes this involves two generations.  Retailers, garages and restaurants will be hit, particularly in the harbour area but not just there.  This will reverberate right throughout the city and the region.<\/p>  <p>  The announcement was a scandal.  Yesterday, 24 hours ago, Novartis announced worldwide operating profits had increased by 15%.  That is the name of the game for modern capitalism.  Profit-hungry sharks record massive profits one day and lay off hundreds of workers the next.  Novartis is a company whose market capitalisation is more than $200 billion.  The company has been built up by workers the likes of whose jobs were axed this morning.<\/p>  <p>  There is now a question over the industrial model the State uses, which involves relying first and foremost on foreign direct investment.  We saw what happened at Molex yesterday.  Increasingly, there is a stronger case to base the State's industrial jobs policy on directly State-run investment, including directly State-run investment in the pharmaceuticals and drugs sector.  We need cheap generic drugs, not least in the context of Brexit.

Today's announcement by Novartis represents a really significant blow to Cork, not only to the harbour area and the Carrigaline area, where I live.  The workers come from all parts of Cork.  That 320 employees, out of a total of 550, are affected is a measure of the scale of the reduction to the workforce that is to happen over the coming years.  It is my understanding that there are a significant number of contractors on the site.  The figure I have been given is between 150 and 200.  If one of the two production buildings is to be shut down over the next two years or so, inevitably those contractors will lose their jobs also.  Can the Minister provide any clarity on this?  It is a key issue.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke directly today to representatives of IDA Ireland and the company.  I implore the Minister to make every effort to save the jobs.  This happened before when Pfizer announced the closure of a plan in Loughbeg, Ringaskiddy.  It was bought by a Portuguese company, Hovione, which continues to operate successfully there.  More recently, GSK in Ringaskiddy, Cork, was acquired by Thermo Fisher, which prevented potential significant job losses also.  There may well be a solution within the pharmaceutical industry.  I ask the Minister to become directly involved with the company and IDA Ireland to ascertain whether a solution can be found.  While 2022 is mentioned in the context of the losses at Novartis, 80 of the jobs affected are in the global service centre.  Those redundancies will occur in the middle of next year.  That is only six or seven months away for many of the workers.  The redundancies will start next year and will conclude in 2022.  This is not something that is way out in the distance; it affects individuals here and now.  I ask the Minister to become directly involved.  My party and I will do whatever we can to help her to achieve a resolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300038#UU00800","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1571840100,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  It is extremely disappointing to hear 320 jobs will be lost across two sites operated by Novartis in Ringaskiddy, particularly following the announcement yesterday that Molex is to close its facility in Shannon, resulting in 500 jobs losses there by the end of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said before, our immediate concern, whenever jobs are lost or are under threat at any firm in the country, is for the employees who will be directly affected.  I assure the House that every form of State assistance and support will be made available to them.  These supports will include assisting the workers in getting alternative employment and helping them to re-skill to ensure that they do so.<\/p>  <p>  Novartis has informed IDA Ireland that the decision to make these redundancies is part of a company global restructuring and consolidation strategy.  We understand that the firm will be relocating some manufacturing roles to contract sites and some business services positions elsewhere in Europe and to Asia.  While it does not change the fact that valuable jobs will be lost, it is important to recognise that the redundancies at the Novartis firm will take place over the next three years: 60 in 2020, 80 in 2021 and 180 in 2022.  That does, at least, provide time in which intensive efforts can be made to offset some of these future job losses through the creation of new employment opportunities in the Ringaskiddy and Carrigaline areas.  We should remember also that both of the companies will continue operating in Ireland, with at least 210 employees once all the planned redundancies have taken effect.  We are optimistic that, in time, the firms will be able to scale back up to their current employment footprint in Ringaskiddy.<\/p> <p>Novartis has assured IDA Ireland that its other operations in Dublin will not be impacted by its restructuring plan.<\/p> <p> Ireland has a strong biopharmaceutical industry, with virtually all of the world's leading firms having a presence here.  As Deputy McGrath will be aware, a number of those companies are also present in Ringaskiddy and the wider Cork area, for example, Pfizer, GE Healthcare, Janssen Sciences and BioMarin.  This means that we can be confident that we will be able to find new job opportunities for the impacted workers.<\/p> <p> Every effort will be made to work with the company to see whether there are new opportunities.  Sometimes when things change, one finds that there are opportunities for companies to create more investment and jobs in a region.  I assure the Deputies that IDA Ireland will do everything it can to engage with the company on examining options and maximising what is available in Ringaskiddy.  My door is always open and I am happy to work with Deputies and hear their views or new ideas on what we can do to help.<\/p> <p> When it comes to job losses, we all know what it is like for workers.  One cannot imagine what is going through their heads when they hear about it or the uncertainty they are facing, especially coming up to Christmas.  They are worried about how they will pay their bills and mortgages.  It is difficult for them, and it takes time for them to come to terms with it.

The workers' union, SIPTU, has stated that its focus is on saving the jobs.  That is a positive comment, but one that will need to be backed with action.<\/p>  <p>  There are 124,000 Novartis workers in 60 plants across the world.

However, it has the problems often associated with many built-up urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to have facilities in place for a growing and ageing population.  There is also growth in the number families moving into Finglas and a demand for more.  That is why I welcome the development of the site of the former Church of the Annunciation, which is in a prime location in north and west Finglas and which is due to be demolished shortly.  The adjoining Fergal's Field site up to Fergal's Lane have been included as part of this development.  The Church of the Annunciation has been a well-known and loved landmark for more than 50 years.  Thanks to its iconic spire and elevated site, the church can be seen for many miles, not just across Finglas, but across Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council has purchased the church site and the adjoining Fergal's Field site and has reached an agreement with the HSE to make available a part of the site for a much-needed primary care centre.  The centre has been a top priority for the HSE for many years.  I have fought for it on behalf of the community in Finglas for a long time.  The primary care centre is urgently needed in light of the ageing population in north and west Finglas.<\/p>  <p>  The Church of the Annunciation site is ideally suited for the proposed projects to be located at the new development.

Part of the plan for the development is to include a Tusla service.<\/p> <p>I also welcome Dublin City Council's plans to build accommodation for senior citizens.  That will help to alleviate the housing crisis in the area by allowing Dublin City Council to buy-up the houses of those senior citizens who wish to avail of the senior citizens' financial contribution scheme, thereby allowing such houses to become available to accommodate families on the ever-growing housing list in Finglas.<\/p> <p> Planning has also been sought for a new church that would be more suited to the needs of the community and its population.  I have also requested that for further community gain the Finglas boxing club, which has been in existence for almost 60 years and has had generations of young people from around the area come through its doors, should have its own dedicated premises.  I have also requested a room for the local pigeon club.  It is very important that the community and the residents in the area are fully consulted on all plans for the site and the proposed developments.

The council is now working to develop this land.  I understand that the smaller site at the rear of the church will be developed for social housing and that plans are at an early stage, as the Deputy indicated, to develop 45 homes for older people on that part of the site.  The initial feasibility study is currently under way and it is hoped that the study will be completed shortly.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the council to advance this housing project and the Department will consider its proposal on receipt of a formal capital appraisal and will assess the proposal speedily.

The Deputy referred to Fergal's Lane, which I presume is the artery to link the site known as Fergal's Field to the wider world.  Fergal's Field will be used by the HSE for the construction of a primary care centre.

That includes 83,760 housing assistance payment, HAP, homes, 3,800 rental accommodation scheme, RAS, homes and more than 50,000 new homes under build, acquisition and leasing.  It is positive to see in the latest construction status report for quarter 2 of this year that 6,439 social homes are currently on site.  The delivery of those homes along with the additional 8,387 homes in the pipeline will substantially aid the continued reduction in the number of households on social housing waiting lists.  Those numbers continue to decline, with a 5% reduction of households on the waiting lists between 2018 and 2019, and a 26% reduction since 2016.  This progress has been possible due to the strong delivery under Rebuilding Ireland with 84,147 homes being delivered under the programme since 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300040#WW00600","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1571841300,"counter":487,"content":"<p>The primary care centre, which was promised for Finglas and is a priority for the HSE, is part of this proposal.

I have lived all my life in Finglas and there has not been a GP in north Finglas and most of west Finglas for as far back as I remember and, therefore, we would welcome a primary care centre with all the facilities it would provide.

The school currently caters for 34 children with a 35th child to start in the coming weeks, which will leave it with just one vacancy.  The school has a staff of 26 with 11 bus escorts.  The children catered for are in the severe to profound range of intellectual disability, moderate to severe intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, ASD.<\/p> <p>They require teaching in a specifically-designed premises away from mainstream education schools.  The circumstances of each child attending the school in Tullamore are unique.  Their needs include learning difficulties, communications disorders, physical disabilities and behaviour and emotional problems, to cite some of the many possible issues pertaining to these children.  I was recently invited to the school to meet the staff and some of the board of management members.  I saw first hand the important and sometimes challenging issues that the teaching and support staff deal with every day.  I thank the Minister for his informal meeting with the principal, Ms Denise Cole, and Mr. Frank Brennan, a member of the board of management.  Deputy Barry Cowen and I imposed on the Minister's official engagement when he went to visit the Midlands Skill Centre.  I thank him for that and I thank the centre for allowing our intervention and the hijacking of a few moments of his time.  It is much appreciated.  It is clear that the staff are providing a great service to the children.  I learned how each child will have a fully tailored education and care programme to ensure that their specific needs are met.  The staff provided me with some of the positive outcomes that have been achieved in Kilcruttin for the children.  The ethos of the school is to work towards incremental improvements and learning outcomes at a pace that suits each child's own needs and abilities.<\/p> <p> There are three ASD classes and three classes for severe, profound and multiple disability.  Many of the children have challenging behaviours and they do not have a general purpose room or a playground.  As the Minister may be aware, movement breaks are essential for children with ASD to manage their sensory regulation which, in turn, reduces episodes of challenging behaviour.  Only one room has a break-out room where children can go in the event that a classroom environment becomes intolerable for them.  Pupils may need to take time out during the school day and it is essential that the students can avail of physiotherapy or relaxation and that there are facilities in the school to allow this.  I was advised during my visit that other students can be negatively impacted and upset during events such as this, and that a lack of suitable facilities currently at the school often escalates situations that would ordinarily be more easily managed.<\/p> <p> The school is in a good position to avail of additional rental space directly adjacent to the premises, if the Department would sanction this development.  I am advised that it will cost approximately &euro;16,000 per annum and I call on the Minister's officials to re-examine the proposal, which I understand was received negatively in the context of the significant benefits that this would bring to the school community.  This proposal is also supported by the HSE physiotherapy department, which says that the children need it, and that equipment is required to be moved around and that storage for it is an issue.  I hope that the Minister can give this matter the urgent consideration it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300040#WW01000","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571841900,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Teachta as &aacute;bhar seo na Saincheisteanna Tr&aacute;th&uacute;la a ard&uacute;.

It was a brief meeting but the message was direct and they certainly put on record the importance of this issue.  We are treating it seriously.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House that the education of children with special educational needs remains a key priority for this Government.  Amid the unknowns of Brexit and the constraints that this imposed on budget 2020, we remain dedicated to doing our best for the most vulnerable children including those with special educational needs.  Equality of opportunity is at the heart of our vision.  Currently, &euro;1.9 billion is being invested in special education, almost one fifth of the overall current education and training budget, which includes almost 13,500 special education teachers and nearly 16,000 SNAs.  Some 124 special schools with 1,500 teachers cater for more than 8,000 students and an additional 1,000 special class places have been provided in this school year, with the establishment of 167 new special classes.  The recent budget includes funding for an additional 1,064 SNA posts, which will be available for allocation next year.  This will bring the total number of SNA posts in our schools to 17,000.  An additional 23 posts will be provided for special schools, designed to meet expected increases in enrolments in special schools due to increasing enrolments and demographics in 2020, providing more than 8,000 places.  It also provides for the continued provision of administrative deputy principal posts in special schools with more than 15 teaching posts introduced in special schools for the first time this September.<\/p>  <p>  A pilot of the new school inclusion model approved by Government on 8 February is being implemented in HSE CHO 7 for this school year, with the continuation of the in-school speech and language and occupational therapy demonstration project to provide in-school and preschool therapy services as part of the school inclusion model.  Children who are attending pilot schools and who receive therapy supports from the HSE will also continue to access such services.  The in-school therapy model is designed to supplement, not to replace, existing services.  Children who require therapy services and who are not attending one of the pilot schools will continue to access services from the HSE.  Health therapy supports for children with disabilities, including physiotherapy supports, are provided by the HSE.  These services are currently being reconfigured into geographically-based teams for children and young people aged zero to 18 who have complex needs under the executive's national programme, Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People.<\/p>  <p>  The special school to which the Deputy refers has access to physical and sensory therapy supports, including physiotherapy supports from the HSE.  The executive also provides nursing support to the school.  An application from the school to my Department for funding to rent additional accommodation, including space for physiotherapy supports was unsuccessful as the school confirmed that it does not have an immediate need for the space and my Department would consider the renting of the property in anticipation of the increased need in the coming years.  A further letter from the school seeking additional accommodation has been received by my Department and the school's long-term accommodation needs are currently being reviewed by my Department.  In a nutshell, there is an updated request and I have asked my officials to look at that to see how we can progress it.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's priority, with the limited funding available, is the provision of essential classroom accommodation in areas where significant demographic need has been established, including special class and special school places, to ensure that each child, including children with special educational needs, will have access to a physical school place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300041#XX00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1571841900,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.

The school management knows from the other schools in the catchment area that further students will require its services.  I welcome the fact that long-term accommodation is being reviewed by the Department.  The Department encouraged the school to convert the existing physiotherapy room into a classroom at a time it had lower numbers.  The need for this particular room is more pressing now.  The Minister referred to the HSE's welcome supports.  It is very supportive of the requirement for the daily programme that is required for children with complex needs and says that more space is definitely required.  The HSE has supported the school's application to the Department and outlined the requirement in detail.<\/p>  <p>  I also wanted to raise the fact that I have been contacted by parents in Edenderry who said that they are concerned that there will not be any space at a second level school for children with ASD who will finish primary school next June.

The Labour Party believes that if the Government is to spend over &euro;2.9 billion of public money on a broadband network over 25 years, such a network should be owned by the State.  One would have to look long and hard to find anyone outside of the Government who would disagree with that.<\/p><p>The question of rural broadband is not about whether we should deliver it.  Everyone agrees we should have comprehensive broadband for every home and business in this country.  Everyone wants the benefits that it will bring and Labour desires equality of access to high-speed broadband across the country.  However, this will be nearly &euro;3 billion given to a private monopoly, which will own the network forever, and the proposed contract will last 25 years but what then?  The private monopoly will then be in a strategic position to charge significantly more to users.  We are not so much as selling the family silver as paying someone to take it off our hands.  Generations to come will wonder at the ineptitude of handing over such a strategic asset to the private sector.  Fine Gael will have to answer for this in a general election.  Why is it committing to hand over a network we will pay for, where the risk has been all but removed, to a private operator?<\/p><p>The purpose of this motion is for the D&aacute;il to make a clear statement on where we stand on ownership.  In a D&aacute;il where decision-making has become debased, this is an opportunity for a meaningful vote on Thursday.  We will give due consideration to the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  The Government's amendment neglects to mention the gap funding model would only work if there was strong competition between bidders, rather than the farce of a tender process we have had.  The other possible ownership structure that was left on the table was discarded by this Fine Gael Government and is not mentioned in the Government amendment.  That option was a full concession model where ownership would revert to the State.  We know the choice was made by Fine Gael Ministers to pursue this flawed model where the price was trebled from &euro;1 billion to &euro;3 billion.  In terms of public procurement seeking value for money on behalf of the public, what happened under this Government was not serious.  It was a joke.<\/p><p>Let us remind ourselves of how we got to this point.  There cannot be a competitive process with only one bidder.  The argument that the remaining bidder is there simply because it outlasted its competitors is not true.  First, Labour left two options on the table, namely, a commercial stimulus model and a concession type arrangement.  Following a recommendation by the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, the Government chose the commercial stimulus model or the so called gap funding model.  Under this model, the private sector would finance, design, build, own and operate the network under contract to the Department.  In other words, the Government rejected the alternative full concession model in which the asset would be handed back to the State after 25 years.  The then Minister, Deputy Naughten, said in his explanation at the time:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am advised that under a Full Concession Model, the entire cost of the project would be placed on the Government&rsquo;s Balance Sheet, with serious implications for the available capital funding over the next five to six years.  Given that both models will deliver the same services and be governed by an almost identical contract(s), I cannot justify reducing the amount of money available to Government for other critical priorities such as Climate Change, Housing and Health, over the next six years. <\/blockquote>  <p>His advice turned out to be completely wrong.  The then Minister, Deputy Naughten, chose a model that surrendered a publicly funded asset to the private sector and yet the cost of the project is still on the public balance sheet and eats into the funding available for the rest of our capital programme.<\/p><p>Second, the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, decided to allow Eir to split out 300,000 profitable households from the rest of the population.  Eir withdrew once it had secured this prize.  The ESB-Vodafone bid, or SIRO as it was called, withdrew after that was allowed to happen.  The truth is that the terms of the State&rsquo;s offer were fundamentally changed once Eir was allowed to redraw the map.  SIRO was more than entitled to leave at that stage.  What was left was Granahan McCourt bidding for the 500,000 hardest-to-reach households.  We saw this consortium reconfigure itself in various ways, including a State purchase of the remaining private shares in Enet from the consortium for an undisclosed price.  Then we found out about a series of meetings and dinners.  Now we are sleepwalking into confirming a disastrous deal, on no other justification than that we have started so we will finish.  That deal pours public money into private pockets.<\/p><p>What the Minister needs to do, even at this 11th hour, is to take this service in-house.  He should cancel the bid and instruct the officials in his Department to get on the phone and talk to the ESB about how the State can deliver broadband itself.  As a former bidder, the ESB will know exactly what is required to deliver broadband to the remaining 500,000 households, and will have detailed knowledge of how it can use its own publicly-owned infrastructure of masts and other infrastructure to deliver this.  We have every right to use the State&rsquo;s own resources to deliver this plan.<\/p><p>No one doubts the importance of getting this plan delivered for households and businesses.  Given the central importance of access to information and knowledge for social inclusion, personal development, equal access to goods and services, and a range of economic opportunities, the importance of providing broadband Internet to the whole population cannot be understated.  The Government talks up the risk of an unacceptable delay if the national broadband plan collapses, but equally unacceptable would be a situation where private enterprises have so much monopoly power that the people end up paying far too much for the delivery of this vital service when State companies could have delivered it for a lower cost.  I would also refer those interested in further reading on this issue to the work and expertise of Dr. D&oacute;nal Palcic and Professor Eoin Reeves from the University of Limerick.<\/p><p>In respect of our motion, I also want to put on the record that our preference was to bring a Bill to put in law our view, and that of the members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, that a broadband network we will pay for must remain in public ownership.  However that Bill was deemed not in keeping with Standing Orders.  Standing Order 179(1) states &quot;A Bill which involves the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys, other than incidental expenses, shall not be initiated by any member, save a member of the Government.&quot;  We were not proposing to appropriate money.  The Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling on our Bill is based on an assumption that, if the contract is signed but is frustrated because of a change in the law, then the State becomes liable to pay compensation.  However, if no contract was signed before the Bill became law, it would be in keeping with Standing Orders.  I do not see how it is possible to say, as Standing Order 179(1) appears to require, that the Bill does involve the appropriation of public money unless and until we know as a fact whether such contracts have been signed.  Incidentally, if no contracts had been signed by the date of introduction of the Bill, it would take a great deal of persuading that the actions of third parties subsequent to that date could make a Bill that complied with Standing Orders out of order.  It seems to me it would lead to an impossible situation if private Members, in drafting legislation, and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle, in ruling on compliance, had to take into account not only the existing factual state of affairs, but what may be a future factual state of affairs at the time a Bill is passed, but without evidence any factual inquiry has been made to ascertain what the facts are or are likely to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300042#YY00400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1571842500,"counter":498,"content":"<p>If the Deputy has a difficulty with my ruling on that particular matter-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300042#YY00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1571842500,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I hope the clock is stopped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300042#YY00600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1571842500,"counter":500,"content":"<p>-----I would be more than happy to meet with him to discuss the reasoning behind it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300042#YY00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1571842500,"counter":501,"content":"<p>A well-regulated market economy requires a strong regulator and a genuine competition among multiple enterprises.<\/p> <p>When it comes to network infrastructure, whether an electricity grid or, in this case, a network of fibre optic cables, it is often not possible to have multiple competing firms.  It is simply prohibitively expensive and patently inefficient to have two overlapping networks.  There is a natural monopoly situation.  Where network infrastructure is concerned, it makes sense for the State, that is, the people, to own and manage any given network.  Networks are too strategically important to be under the control of private sector organisations.  They have too much market power to limit the ability to charge high rates of access to the network.  The EU has extensive rules to promote competition and limit state aid.  From a Labour Party perspective, we are sometimes at odds with these rules, but when it comes to rural broadband there is no European impediment - we have checked this out - to State ownership.  There are volumes of specific European reports and policies to promote and support the extension of broadband Internet into rural areas.<\/p> <p> What Fine Gael has done with rural broadband is completely at odds with sensible economic decision-making.  What was proposed by Labour Party Ministers at the beginning of the project was a competitive process with five bidders seeking to build a national broadband network to serve almost 1 million homes and businesses.  The former Minister, Deputy Naughten, then collapsed the competitive aspect of the bidding process by unilaterally taking 300,000 premises out of the procurement process and giving them to Eir.  This led to all of the bidders dropping out except for Enet, which formed and reformed new consortia that ended up being led by Granahan McCourt, with various other partners entering or exiting the bid.<\/p> <p> We all know about the fiasco of the informal dinners between the former Minister, which led to his resignation from the Government.  Not only did Fine Gael press on with a grievously flawed process that should have been halted, but then Fine Gael came to the conclusion that it was okay to pay &euro;3 billion for the rural broadband network, far more, as my colleague has said, than the original estimate, to deliver a network to fewer homes and then give ownership of the network to an entirely private entity.  To add insult to injury, the new entity is to be called National Broadband Ireland, even though it is not a publicly owned national company.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael proposes to give &euro;3 billion of the people's money to a private monopoly that will own the network forever.  The proposed contract will last 25 years but at that stage the private monopoly will be in a strategic position to charge whatever it likes for access to it.  This is a major strategic risk for the taxpayer.  If the network becomes very expensive to maintain, the private operator can simply cut and run.  If it is profitable, consumers will pay more than they need to access the Internet and it will hold back job growth throughout rural Ireland.  It is clearly the best proposition to have the rural broadband network in public ownership.<\/p> <p> The purpose of this motion is to be very clear in our statement as a House that we want rural broadband but we want it in public ownership.  We want people in businesses in small towns and rural areas, such as my county, to have access to fast Internet connections for all of the many positive reasons, from education to commerce and health purposes to entertainment, that we can all recite.  Rural broadband deserves to have the infrastructure and the Labour Party has no issue with the need to make a major public investment for this to be delivered.  However, let us not set up something that will cost more money in the long term.  Let us not give &euro;3 billion of public money to a private operator.  It is not as if that operator will provide broadband free of charge.  It will thank the taxpayers very much for the &euro;3 billion and then charge for the use of the network.  The only way to keep control of the cost for rural homes and businesses is for it to be State-owned.  The view of the Labour Party is the State can create a marketplace using the broadband network.  Internet service providers can compete to offer people connection to the Internet using this network and they can compete through different television station offerings or pricing.  In that model, the State would keep control of the network and would provide certainty that the market can be kept well regulated and focused on the need to serve the public good.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael can argue all it likes about the commitment of those proposing a private monopoly on rural broadband but the private venture capital company involved in the Government plan will be able to sell its shares in nine years' time.  This means the Government has no idea who will ultimately own the network beyond nine years' time.  The proposed contract will only allow the Minister to block the sale of shares in the first nine years.  We know the sole bidder in the national broadband plan is a venture capital company and not a telecoms company.  It seems obvious it sought and was given the option of selling on Ireland's broadband network at some point in future because that is what venture capitalists do.  This is why ownership of the network is so important.  We saw what happened when Eircom was bought by vulture funds.  They stripped the assets from the company and sold it on.  There is no doubt that vulture funds could buy up National Broadband Ireland, squeeze what money it could out of it and then sell it on.  It would be an entirely different matter if the public was to own the network rather than it be a private monopoly.<\/p> <p> What exactly are these venture capitalists bringing to the project?  What is their stake in it that could not be provided by a publicly owned company?  From the perspective of the Labour Party, we must restore the confidence and ability that Ireland had in earlier times when the country was only beginning to develop economically.  There is no reason we cannot set up a national broadband company as a commercial semi-State body.  It is how we delivered water to every home.  It is how we delivered electrification.  It is how we delivered natural gas.  It is how we first delivered television and telephones.<\/p> <p> After 2008, we rescued the public finances so that Ireland can borrow once more at competitive rates on the international markets.  National debt is under control, meaning we can now afford to build and own our own vital infrastructure such as broadband.  Given the private investor is paying significantly less than 50% of the cost, as seems to be the case and nobody denies this, and the State is paying more than 50%, the project, therefore, will be on the State's books regardless of who owns the network at the end of the day.  The Minister might confirm this point in his response.  As my colleague has said, this negates the argument to keep it off the public books and in competition with schools, health expenditure and climate expenditure.<\/p> <p> Why on earth, after 25 years, would the people not own the network for which they paid?  Almost all previous public-private contracts involved the public ownership of the asset at the end of a set period.  Why is this project different?  This is a purely Fine Gael Government decision taken in July 2016, two months after the Labour Party left government.  I believe it is an ideological decision that flies in the face of good economics and sound management of the public finances.  We have seen Fine Gael mismanage the national children's hospital, the funding for the metro and other projects.  It has mismanaged several mid-level capital investments and it certainly has mismanaged investment in the national broadband plan.  It is not just the Labour Party saying this represents very poor value for money.  Senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have said so too.  The Secretary General of that Department, a man known to be clear in his thoughts, has described the level of profit to the investors as very high for the level of risk they are taking.  They are getting a great deal.<\/p> <p> We established that Department to safeguard the public's money and we thought we had moved into an era of greater political responsibility with the public finances, having learned from some of the disastrous mistakes of the past.  The Labour Party wants to see high-speed rural broadband delivered as soon as possible and we are committed to ensuring the State ponies up the necessary costs to achieve this, as long as the network that is built with public money remains in public ownership.  In 25 years' time, access to broadband will be even more essential than it is now.<\/p> <p>All of us, in our daily lives, will be more dependent for all services on fast, effective broadband access.  <\/p> <p> We delivered the rural electrification scheme through a public enterprise that has served the country well and faithfully for generations as a quality employer and profitable company that has paid &euro;1.5 billion in dividends to the State since the 2008 crash.  Modelled on the rural electrification scheme, we should have an ESB-style national broadband company to retain control over prices into perpetuity and eliminate the possibility of ruthless investors taking over rural broadband services.  The Minister can give no guarantees after nine years.<\/p> <p> The motion simply states public moneys should not be expended on any proposed broadband network until it is to be owned by a Minister or a public body on behalf of the people.  I hope Deputies across all sections of the D&aacute;il will support this important motion in order that we can deliver rural broadband services without trapping future generations in unseen costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300042#YY00800","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571843700,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:  \tagrees that:<br \/><br \/>- without high speed broadband, 1.1 million people, mostly living in rural Ireland, will not have access to high speed broadband, and will be left behind;<br \/><br \/>- without high speed broadband it will be significantly more difficult to attract new jobs to rural areas and develop new enterprise opportunities and it will be more difficult to retain the jobs that currently exist in these areas;<br \/><br \/>- you cannot sustain a healthy democracy if there are major groups of people who feel they are being left behind;<br \/><br \/>- without high speed broadband, it will be impossible for rural Ireland to take advantage of the opportunities that are presented by the digital economy, from healthcare to farming, and from education to agriculture, rural development and tourism; and<br \/><br \/>- without high speed broadband, remote working, which would allow people to have more flexible working arrangements, and to reduce their carbon footprint and urban sprawl by reducing the numbers commuting to large cities, will not be possible;<br \/><br \/>notes that:<br \/><br \/>- the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is considering the recent report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in relation to the National Broadband Plan (NBP) and will revert<br \/><br \/>to the Government shortly in relation to the recommendations in the Committee report;<br \/><br \/>- the advice of the Attorney General is that it is not legally possible to change the 2016 ownership decision within the current procurement process;<br \/><br \/>- cancelling the current procurement process, starting again and getting to the point at which contracts can be signed could take at a minimum three years and up to five years, with no guarantee of a successful outcome, in which case the roll-out of high<br \/><br \/>speed broadband may not commence until 2026 and may not be completed until 2032, which would only serve to deepen the digital divide that exists in this country;<br \/><br \/>- in appointing a preferred bidder, the Government considered a number of alternative options to delivering the NBP, including changing the ownership model, and that from that work, it was clear that the analysis showed that all of the alternative options<br \/><br \/>identified would take longer to reach 100 per cent of the Intervention Area premises compared to the current plan (or in some cases 100 per cent would never be achieved), and that:<br \/><br \/>- it may be more costly;<br \/><br \/>- in most cases would require a consultation on a new strategy as well as a new procurement process and State-aid application; and <br \/><br \/>- it may not provide the level of future proofing required under the European Commission&rsquo;s strategy, Connectivity for a European Gigabit Society; <br \/><br \/>- the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, commenced a public consultation in July 2015 on the Intervention Strategy for the NBP, which included consideration of five alternative ownership options, and that the then<br \/><br \/>Minister in December 2015 recommended to the Government two possible ownership options, one of which was the gap-funded model, and then established an interdepartmental group to recommend the best way to proceed;<br \/><br \/>- an inter-departmental group reviewed the appropriate ownership model and based on this review the Department recommended the gap-funded model, and that it was then adopted by the Government in July 2016; and<br \/><br \/>- the State can receive 40 per cent of the value of the National Broadband Network at the end of the contract, without any of the risk associated with owning 146,000 kilometres of fibre wire that have been hanging on rented infrastructure for 25 or 35<br \/><br \/>years; and <br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to proceed to sign the National Broadband Plan Contract as soon as possible, as the 1.1 million people mostly living in rural Ireland have waited long enough to get connected to a service which is, or will be, freely available to virtually every person in towns and cities across Ireland.  <\/blockquote>  <p>The reason we are implementing this plan is that there are more than 1.1 million people who would be left behind if we did not make a decision to deliver broadband.  They would include 100,000 businesses, 540,000 premises and nearly 25% of the population.  The process in which we have engaged has been open.  Any company, public or private, could have entered that process.  They had equal opportunity to do so.  The implication of the Labour Party's motion and Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment is that we scrap this process and start all over again.  It has been made clear by the Attorney General that it is not open to the Government to pick the ESB, or any other public utility, and gift it with the opportunity to implement the plan.  Starting again would mean having a new procurement process.<\/p><p>We face a choice.  I see no scenario in which rural Ireland will prosper without access to high speed broadband.  The motion and Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment state rural Ireland must wait another three to five years before it can have access to this technology.  The reality, as Deputy Howlin admits, is that it is a transformative technology that will change the face of health delivery and education.

In July 2015 the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Alex White, engaged in a consultative process on what the model should be.  He considered a number of options, including a public utility, as Deputy Howlin is advocating today.  He also considered an option in which the State would own the asset throughout and there would only be a concession for five years.  A commercial stimulus, gap-funded model was also considered, as was a concessionaire agreement, under which ownership would revert to the State after 25 years.  The then Minister ruled out a public utility, a State-owned asset which would be owned throughout the process, and narrowed down the options to either the commercial stimulus model or the model under which there would be a reversion to the State after 25 years.  That, in turn, was referred to an ownership sub-group which consisted of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA; NewERA; the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with which Deputy Howlin is very familiar.  KPMG Group was adviser to the group.  A very detailed evaluation followed the public consultation that had occurred on the model that was to be picked.  In 2016 the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, came back to the Government and recommended that we follow the commercial stimulus model.  The reason was that it would be better on cost and non-cost grounds and because of how the capacity of the add-on to the existing privately owned network could best be delivered to the advantage of those who would use it with the least risk to the State.  As the reports have been published, people can view how the decision was taken.<\/p>  <p>  Far from it being an ideological view of Fine Gael, as the Labour Party seeks to portray it, it was an iterative process in which various options were considered.  They included the wholly-owned public utility model, the gap-funded model, the concessionaire agreement and so on and a decision was made that the best option was to go with the so-called gap-funded model which would seek to stimulate the commercial sector to do something that it was not otherwise going to do.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin said the then Minister unilaterally removed 300,000 premises from the process.  The reality is that, if one is to go the State aid route, it must be on the basis that the commercial sector is not willing to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300044#AAA00400","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1571843700,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Does the Minister accept the competition collapsed as a result?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300044#AAA00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1571843700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>We were always going to have to provide State aid if rural Ireland was to have access to high speed broadband.

The reality is that the State needs to provide, with State support, access to high speed broadband in the most cost effective way possible.  We have to rent 1.5 million poles and 15,000 km of duct.  We need a company to string fibre along that private network in order to reach those who would otherwise not be reached.  That is the reality.  The asset being developed by National Broadband Ireland is to deliver fibre to areas that would not have it otherwise and, naturally, the State has to substantially subsidise it.  The technology for use in the exchanges in the metropolitan area network, MAN, must also be provided privately through National Broadband Ireland putting in its technology to light up the system.  That is what National Broadband Ireland is delivering.  <\/p>  <p>  We must be honest.  The Deputy is suggesting National Broadband Ireland can charge what it likes, but that is not the case.  It is bound by a contract and a regulator.  The contract we have put in place has checks and balances built in because National Broadband Ireland is privately owned.  That is why we have very strong governance arrangements in place, with key performance indicators, stringent penalties and a claw-back of 40% of the value of the asset if it has value at the end of the process.  Members who attended the hearings of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment on this matter will know that ComReg presented the case that the 25 year old fibre and electronic equipment used by National Broadband Ireland would not have a high depreciation value.  The only value will be in the business that will have been built.  That is why ComReg was always of the view that there should not be an asset reverting to the State that had been run into the ground, as will be the case.  What is needed is an asset that will be kept up to a standard because the company will have a continuing interest in delivering a service to rural Ireland and maintaining it to the highest quality, future proofing it, adding new technology and pushing it from the figure of 30 Mbps that we sought initially when Deputy Howlin and I were in government together and looking for this to 50 Mbps.  We are offering and delivering a future-proofed approach with this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  It is simply not true that there were cheaper alternatives.  At every hand's turn, we looked at the alternatives the Deputies are now advocating.  They were looked at after Eir exited the process.  We looked at having a universal service obligation and utilities such as the ESB.  We looked at all of the options and one would have had to scrap the process and start again.  There would then have been another procurement process of three to five years in going down those routes.<\/p> <p>There was no expectation that other options would deliver at a lower cost.  The ESB was in the process but dropped out of it because it did not believe it would be as competitive in delivering with its network as could be delivered using the rented Eir network.  It had every opportunity.  People were not excluded.  The Deputy is correct that the EU does not preclude a public utility from delivering broadband.  Any utility can do so but this approach was taken.<\/p> <p> I strongly recommend to the House that we continue with the process.  We have gone through a competitive dialogue.  We sought the best technology and we got it.  We sought the best approach and are building the infrastructure on an existing network to keep down the cost.  We have integrated it into the existing telecommunications network.  Rural Ireland will grow with the technology and will have full access to a national technology, which is why this is a national programme.  At every hand's turn, we re-evaluated the process, in accordance with public expenditure rules.  None of the options for which Deputies now advocate was better but instead they had the added disadvantage that they would push the whole process back to the start.<\/p> <p> That is the choice we have today.  Either we decide we will provide national broadband and give rural Ireland access to this asset or we say there will be another report, another assessment and start from scratch all over again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300044#AAA01000","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571844300,"counter":514,"content":"<p>There are people who would love to watch the debate online at home, at their business or on their computer today but they cannot because their Internet speed cannot support streaming.  That is the reality in 2019 but it is entirely unacceptable.  It is despite all the lofty rhetoric, cast-iron promises, the debates going back to 2011 and the long-held concerns about costs, bidders and tendering processes.  The Minister spoke about not being able simply to gift the tender to a State utility but the irony is that under Fine Gael, a suspicious gift that is shrouded in concern has been given to a venture capitalist in New York, which all the reports have underpinned, even though it could have given it to a public utility.  Hundreds of thousands of homes throughout the country have nothing but there have been dozens of consultants&rsquo; reports, even more unminuted meetings, a ministerial resignation, countless missed deadlines and overspending on a level matched only by the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The net result is no proper broadband service and a deeply held distrust that the Government will finally deliver for rural Ireland.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Labour Party's motion.<\/p>  <p>  The report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment is important work that clearly highlights the utter failure of the Government and its predecessor to deliver on broadband.  In addition to the motion, which emanated from the committee&rsquo;s report, it is important to note some of the other important findings not mentioned.  They include an external independent review on whether the current proposals and the costs of the national broadband plan are the only viable option at this stage; the need for a new cost-benefit analysis; and an update on the Smyth review, which examined a raft of issues with the national broadband plan.  Considerable information has come to light since the review.  The committee&rsquo;s report also called for the update to be given within a month of its publication in August.  Like the people in rural Ireland, still we wait.  Likewise, we are still waiting for action from the Minister following motions tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il regarding the plan .<\/p>  <p>  We have all lost count of the number of promises we have heard in respect of broadband.  In 2011, we were told high-speed connectivity would be rolled out to 90% of homes and businesses by 2015 but a year later, it was to be 100% of homes and businesses by 2020.  In 2016, there was another commitment, this time that 85% of the country would be covered by 2018.  Most recently, we have been told a contract will be signed by Christmas.  After so many promises, it seems the people of rural Ireland are not the only ones who are sceptical and running out of patience.  The private sector, too, no longer believes the Government.  Imagine has announced plans to cover 234,000 of the 540,000 premises in the intervention area, while Eir has announced plans for 80,000 premises.  The Government intends to allow National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to lay fibre in the same spots, which means the Government will pay Granahan McCourt to overbuild past 300,000 homes where fibre already has been laid by commercial operators.  Whatever about the inherent lack of wisdom of that decision, it will have clear state aid consequences the Government has ignored and that it contradicted in its argument in response to the motion.  As it stands, NBI will provide just &euro;220 million, comprising &euro;175 million in equity and &euro;45 million in working capital, for a project that will cost &euro;3 billion to deliver.  Despite claims to the contrary, the State holds all the risk.  NBI can afford to walk away within a decade and will recoup its money within seven or eight years, carry little risk thereafter and retain full ownership.<\/p>  <p>  As the communications committee found, there is no justification for the resulting network to be owned by the minority investor instead of the majority investor.  When the Government has previously spoken about ownership of the network, it stated it was merely a wire on somebody else&rsquo;s pole and some brackets.  It is far more than that.  The Oireachtas committee indicated it would be worth approximately &euro;500 million to the consortium.  It concerns potentially 400,000 wholesale customers, jobs in rural Ireland and is the result of massive investment on the part of the State.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the strategic value of broadband in areas commercial operators will never cover and that the network should be retained. <\/p>  <p>  I will conclude with the stark warnings from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which must be heeded.  I implore the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, whose Department is worried about a raft of aspects of the plan, including cost, affordability, value for money and risk.  Officials from that Department have labelled the cost-benefit analysis on which the Government has based its decision as &ldquo;not credible\".  The protracted history of the national broadband plan is a case study of the Government ignoring clear warning signs.  It appears the warnings of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, too, have been ignored.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the best indicator of how likely it is the Government will deliver the national broadband plan is the funds that have been made available, and how much are needed.  To date, the funds required to deliver the national broadband plan have not been set aside.  An additional &euro;1.3 billion must be found in the coming years, over and above the &euro;800 million allocated for the plan.  Despite the promises, the Government has not done that.  It is bizarre that it claims that the roll-out will soon begin, given that the necessary funds have not even been put aside.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, must urgently clarify the Government&rsquo;s plans to fund the contract he intends to sign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300045#BBB00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1571844300,"counter":515,"content":"<p>There is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>about the debate.  In the short time during which I have been a Deputy, we have had numerous discussions on the matter.  Since 2011, when the previous Fine Gael-led Government assumed office, the first promise was made, and here we are almost in 2020.  Two themes have emerged.  The bill keeps multiplying but not a scrap of fibre has been laid under the contract, which is not yet even in place.  I, along with many colleagues on this side of the House, have highlighted the wastefulness, the dogged delays, the obfuscation, as well as the failure to grasp the nettle in respect of the issue and to examine the ways the process could be completed without having recourse to the current arrangements.<\/p><p>I am the Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment and during the summer, we scrutinised and studied the proposal in detail.  Without outlining all the recommendations of the committee, it made more than a dozen recommendations for direct action that arose from detailed scrutiny of the proposal.  None of the recommendations was to endorse the tender or the Government's plan, and in fact, endorsement was rejected by a majority vote of the dedicated Oireachtas committee tasked with scrutinising the tender.  To give a flavour of the findings of the committee, we noted that the State proposes to throw &euro;3 billion at a consortium, or what appears to be a finance house with a couple of subcontractors hanging off it, with no proven track record of delivery of broadband or other infrastructure.  While I carry the flag for no particular bidder, this is at a time when Eir has appeared before the committee to tell us it could have delivered the project for less than &euro;1 billion.  If nothing else, therefore, we are paying treble for a project when there has not yet been a line of fibre or even a duct yet dug.  The entire project has been obfuscated, misapplied and mismanaged from the outset, yet nine years later we are no closer to a decision.<\/p> <p>All the while the interminable negotiations and the unseemly tender business have been progressing, the technology has been advancing.  The very purpose of the tender has now been called into question.  While these interminable negotiations have been ongoing, the private sector has been penetrating those areas of its own accord with different technology mixes.  Firms have rolled up their sleeves and got on with it.  A few moments ago the Minister talked about the 540,000 houses still to be connected.  A previous Minister would have talked about 800,000 homes to be connected.  Perhaps the next Minister will tell us about 300,000 houses, and so on <i>ad infinitum<\/i>.  I am not sure what the final number will be but it is clear that the number of homes to be targeted by State intervention is decreasing at exactly the same time that the cost of that intervention is multiplying exponentially.  On the matter of cost, we know the views of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as my colleagues have already mentioned.  Mr. Robert Watt has done the State some service by putting those views on record.  I have commended him in the committee and I commend him again tonight on stating on record that the cost-benefit analysis does not stack up.  This project could break the bank, especially when added to the children's hospital and all the other wasteful and wanton projects commissioned by this Government. <br\/><br\/>Regarding the raw figures, I note that Imagine Communications Group is now posing a challenge.  That group has now rolled out 5G solutions through alternative technologies.  It is well documented that Eir took 300,000 homes out of the group of 800,000 because it could do so.  Every step of the way, a new provider with a new system and a new technology comes into the intervention area and offers to do it commercially, saying there is no need to throw hard-earned State money at the problem when other solutions exist.<br\/><br\/>We have missed the opportunity to take positive practical steps along the way.  There have been many different initiatives and the Minister's predecessors and the Department have formed multiple task forces.  There have been three different task forces on the delivery of rural broadband and mobile telephony, which is a related concern.  There have been many practical recommendations, very few of which have actually been enacted.  Each Minister seems to come along and reheat them as if in a microwave, take the report out again a year later and announce it to great fanfare without actually doing anything about it.  I have drafted legislation which tackles many practical aspects of these issues, such as planning permission requiring fibre to the doorstep rather than the roadside.  Ducting is so expensive to lease from the likes of Transport Infrastructure Ireland that it is actually cheaper for homeowners to dig up the road themselves than to hire ducting, even within two State agencies.  I refer to absurd anomalies, conflicting local area plans, arcane planning processes and the lack of a streamlined fast track for this kind of infrastructure.  These factors all combine to make it more difficult for the private sector to get into the market yet it is doing so anyway, more quickly and more cheaply than the State infrastructure, which has yet to pass &quot;Go&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>I will make one final point before I conclude and yield to my colleagues.  My party passed a motion on this 18 months ago and I introduced legislation on this two years ago.  There have been multiple attempts to tackle these issues on this side of the House, through legislation, Private Members' motions and other methods.  We have all heard sorry sagas from all sides of the House about voting in the last few days.  However, it is beyond doubt that the Government has debased the voting system.  It has done a disservice to democracy by ignoring every motion, vote and Private Members' bill that has been introduced from any other side of the House.  That is a disservice to democracy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300045#BBB00300","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571844900,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

The overspend could be as high as &euro;3 billion, and what the State will own at the end is extremely questionable.  This will match the huge overrun on the national children's hospital and it will cause many capital projects around the country to be delayed, with some ultimately abandoned.  My own constituents in Tipperary are concerned that the project at St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel will be seriously delayed because of these overruns.  It must be asked if the delay in providing acute mental health beds in Tipperary, which were promised by the Minister on numerous occasions, was caused by the massive project overspend I have outlined.<\/p>  <p>  Last month the Taoiseach announced yet another delay to the broadband plan as it emerged that commercial operators rolling out products in the intervention area had queried the State subsidising a competitor.  Even if the contract is signed by Christmas, not a single metre of fibre will be rolled out in 2019.  This stands in stark contrast to the Government's previous commitment that 85% of premises would be covered by 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Our position on the roll-out of broadband is clear and simple.  High-speed broadband should be provided to the intervention area as quickly as possible, to the same standard as is commercially available in other parts of the country, at the same cost to consumers as elsewhere and at best value to the taxpayer.  The Government cannot deny that rural Ireland is not benefiting from any perceived growth in the economy.  On the contrary, this Government has introduced policies that have actively damaged economic growth in rural communities.

In 2012 Fine Gael promised to deliver high-speed broadband to 100% of homes by 2020.

This is despite Fine Gael's promise to deliver broadband to everyone by 2015, the first of many broken promises.  That was four years ago.  The national broadband plan has failed utterly.  A contract has not even been signed with a provider.  Once again, Fine Gael is hoping to announce, announce and reannounce while failing to deliver.  The deadline keeps moving.  Some 85% of homes were supposed to be connected by 2018.  That commitment has not been delivered.  We know now that not a single metre of fibre will be rolled out in 2019 but nobody is surprised.  There is yet another delay.  Why is rural Ireland left at the back of the queue by this Government time and time again?<\/p>  <p>  People can see the lack of local services and investment and the impact this has on their lives and for themselves.  It might come as a surprise to the Minister that the north-west region has been downgraded to a region in development by the European Commission while the rest of the country is considered developed.  We are now officially a developing region in a First World country in 2019.  There was no alarm on the part of the Government, no sense of urgency and no reaction whatsoever.  Where is the Minister's sense of urgency in addressing the infrastructure deficit in Mayo and the north west?  How much longer are we supposed to wait for the Government to get its act together?  <\/p>  <p>  The plan was initially intended to cost &euro;800 million, which for everybody outside of Fine Gael is a lot of money.  However, as with every other major capital project managed by Fine Gael in government, there have been massive overruns and the Government has spent and spent.  Fine Gael has basically lost millions of euro of taxpayers' money because it simply cannot stick to budgets or properly plan capital projects.  We now need an additional &euro;1.3 billion to roll out a project that was supposed to cost &euro;800 million.  That is more than double the initial cost, and more than the entirety of the fiscal space available to this country in 2020.<\/p> <p>It is a colossal overspend that Fine Gael considered to be nothing.  Is there no alarm in the Government benches at this massive reckless overspending once again on a major capital project?  The Taoiseach told the House that this will not impact on services and will have no budget implications.  How is that possible?  How can the Government overspend by &euro;1.3 in the coming years without having any implication on services?  Is it planning on pulling the extra &euro;1.3 billion out of a sock somewhere?<\/p> <p> We get the same line with the national children's hospital, another major capital project that has gone millions of euro over budget.  Initially supposed to cost approximately &euro;650 million, we now know the cost is &euro;1.7 billion and rising.  That is an overspend of &euro;1.1 billion.  It will be the most expensive hospital build anywhere in the country.  It speaks to the fairy-tale economics practised by Fine Gael, the massive overspends and telling the country, \"It's okay.  It's not our money.  We'll spend it anyway.\"<\/p> <p> We can see the impact of this overspend in services throughout the country.

I also want to quote from a letter he sent to his counterpart at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  In a letter he wrote in April 2019, he stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHaving expressed our concerns on a number of occasions at this stage in relation to the affordability and value for money of the proposed contract for the National Broadband Plan, I wish to re-emphasise one further time this Department's fundamental concerns in relation to the unprecedented risk that the State is being asked to bear in the event that the current NBP contract is recommended for approval by Government. <\/blockquote>  <p>In this letter the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - not the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in or anybody else - is saying there is a risk to the taxpayer and it is not the best model.  That has happened on the Minister's watch; it is his decision.  I also agree with Deputy Howlin who has said this is ideological.  The Government had a number of options and decided not to choose them.<\/p><p>Many of the providers who had been in the bidding process appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  They also talked about the origins of this process and its failures which led to some of them dropping out of the process and led to others not entering the process in the first place.  This was an inherently flawed model that was always going to fail.  It was always going to lumber the taxpayer with an enormous cost while not owning the infrastructure at the end of it.  That is on the Minister's watch.  We will not continue to support this simply because Fine Gael made a mess of it.

We have wasted public money.  Any progress made by the private companies, Eir, Vodafone or Imagine has been in spite of Government's plans and actions.  The Government has failed rural areas with this national broadband plan.<\/p>  <p>  In Laois, 12,720 homes are still waiting for broadband and the number for Offaly is similar.  Some 11,500 people commute from Laois every day to go to work.  Some of them could work from home if they had broadband and the same is true for those in Offaly.  For the sake of job creation, carbon reduction, better community and family life, we ask the Minister to consider taking a step back from the plan and realise that it is a reckless squandering of taxpayers' money.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the House that the plan is to give &euro;3 billion of taxpayers' money to an American investor with little or no experience in broadband or telecommunications.  It is economic madness.  The Government needs to recognise that its plan has been banjaxed for a long time.  It is obvious to everyone that the plan is on the road to nowhere.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sounded warning bells in the strongest terms possible.  I served on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment for three years.  That committee went through this painstakingly and recommended clearly that the Government halt the process it is going through and change tack to doing a public model.  There is only one beneficiary of this so far and that is the consultants.  If the plan proceeds the beneficiary will be the private entity with which it finished up.<\/p>  <p>  Our amendment proposes that the Government approaches the ESB, a State-owned utility company with a proven track record.  It has the infrastructure connected to every home in the State.  It is a utility that is already in the broadband game.  It is in a position to start rolling out this.  We need Government to re-engage with it.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the state aid rules and the 300,000 picked out by Eir damaged this process as I said on the day it was announced.

For a long time I had been happy to go along with the Government thinking that at least we would get broadband at some stage to the people of rural Ireland.  I am beginning to doubt that will happen, especially when I see Eircom going about rolling out this so-called expansion to meet the customers it was given by the previous Minister at a late stage in negotiations.  We get calls from members of the public asking why is it not being extended.  It is because of the fiasco at the hands of the Government.  Eircom will deliver so far down the road then stop and say that it is for the national broadband plan from that point on.  The calls move around from place to place as Eircom rolls out its process.  It is a fiasco and while I imagine it is hard for the Minister to stand over it, sometimes I wonder.<\/p>  <p>  This fiasco started in 2000 or whenever it was that Fianna F&aacute;il privatised Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  That is the crux of the problem.  We have been dealing with that privatisation ever since.  We know that ordinary members of the public got shafted then because they were encouraged to buy shares that collapsed in price.  Then we come to this Government's national broadband plan.  The Government put it out to tender and got a response from private bodies, Eircom, the ESB and Vodafone came together as SIRO, and the third project came in as well.  The Minister then turned around and gave the cream of the crop to Eircom.  These are the places Eircom should have been connecting but did not bother its arse because it knew nobody was going to come after it.  When it became obvious through this tendering process that it might not get those places, it said they were within its sphere and that it would supply them anyway.  Therefore the Government rolled over and gave them to Eircom.  Then the ESB and everybody else pulled out and the whole project collapsed again.  That led to the situation we are in today and to this motion. <\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party motion probably makes sense but at this stage we will obviously have to stop the whole process, cancel it and throw it out, retender and do it in such a way that it remains in public ownership.  That may be fair enough.  I welcome the Labour Party's bringing this forward but I wonder if Labour were in government would it do this.  I doubt that very much, unfortunately.  It is the way we should be going because it is too late at this stage. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister said the EU would not stop a public utility from getting this but that is not the road we have gone down.  The Government has gone so far in this process that it is not going to change.  That is wrong and the people of rural Ireland would be better served by stopping the process and restarting it.  That would make a bigger difference.  Maybe we should buy back Eircom because that would be cheaper than the tender that the Government is awarding now to add to the tail of the process.  It should just bite the bullet and say the mess was made when Telecom &Eacute;ireann was sold and buy it back.  Then we could deliver broadband that would be of benefit to everybody and we the people would gain from that in the future.  It is an ideological problem and question and it certainly would not be in Fine Gael's remit to decide to do something like that, which is the problem.  That is probably the only solution to deliver broadband for everybody and keep it in the ownership of the people.  Fine Gael will not go down that road but that is the only viable option left. <\/p>  <p>  If it is retendered it will go through public procurement and there will be some weird anomaly of Eircom owning it to a certain stage and the public owning it from another stage and it will be a fiasco.  The Government will probably spend the next couple of years working on that, putting together a contract and tendering it for a cost of &euro;5 billion when we should buy Eircom.  The owners of Eircom would probably take &euro;3 billion for it.  That would deal with the issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300048#EEE00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1571846100,"counter":528,"content":"<p>When will this contract really be signed?

It provides significant growth opportunities for businesses that trade online and a global market for rural tourism and small artisan producers.  It is also an important resource for schools, private homes and organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen is a fantastic facility, with 1 GB of super-fast broadband and state-of-the-art facilities.  Outside of this, towns and rural areas in west Cork, including Schull, Goleen, Durrus and as far away as Inis Orga in Bandon are struggling with no, or subpar, broadband.  We are told the NBP will take seven years to roll out and will cost &euro;3 billion, but we can take that estimated cost with a grain of salt.  Without broadband, expensive electronic equipment such as whiteboards purchased by primary schools and efforts by Age Action to promote computer literacy among the elderly in rural areas, are undermined. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Farmers' Association has said that broadband is an essential tool for the business of farming but many farmers are still struggling with dial-up connection speeds, never mind fibre broadband.  In our cities, we have world-class Internet speeds, but rural areas rank among the worst served regions of Europe.  Rural broadband is no longer a luxury; it is a social and economic necessity.

People who built homes in west Cork are being quoted extortionate amounts to connect to the wired grid.  There is a universal service fund in America.  Congress created a mandatory charge for carriers of voice service and Internet providers.  It requires a contribution of a percentage of their revenues for providing these services.  This was first implemented in 1988 to ensure affordable access to telecommunications services to help provide Internet access for rural healthcare facilities.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has failed the people in broadband service provision.

In addition to the work of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Committee of Public Accounts also did work on the NBP and its forerunner the metropolitan area network, MAN, contracts.  The main concern is how the State will fund the system and if, when complete, it will be handed over to a private entity.  While we initially were told that the cost would be approximately &euro;500 million, the cost has escalated to in the region of &euro;3 billion, which is a small fortune.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we are, or could be, heavily subsidising the construction of a network that the private sector will own.  I refer to an observation by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the draft memorandum to Government on the national broadband plan.  It refers to a contingent subsidy for encroachment, but the figures are redacted.  I have been told that this is likely to mean that where the provider in place is tasked with providing broadband to an area that later becomes part of the intervention area, the provider will be entitled to a subsidy because of encroachment.  The Minister might address that point.  If that is the case, we need to know the amount set aside for such a subsidy.  <\/p>  <p>  Even though there was always only one bidder, the make-up of that bidder has changed substantially and it is difficult to figure out who exactly is involved.  Enet was involved, as was Granahan McCourt.  It is worth noting that when Enet managed the MANs contract, several complaints were made about the lack of transparency in pricing.  During that time, we had some of the most expensive broadband in Europe, as set out in the Analysys Mason report.  Can the State afford to heavily subsidise infrastructure only to hand it over to a private entity, the sole concern of which will be profit margins?  What will be the cost of broadband to the people who want to take it up?  It is worth noting that the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Robert Watt, described this as an unprecedented risk for the State given the amount of public funding being tossed around, with no guarantees in regard to value for money.  He said he found it difficult to believe that a convincing case could be made for this project.  He went on to list a number of key infrastructure projects that would not be delivered as a result of proceeding with the NBP in its current format.  This may well impact on rural Ireland.  It may be that some projects will not be delivered on foot of the delivery of a service that is way more expensive than it needs to be and that we may not own.  We have to look at this in the round.  It is unusual for somebody in Mr. Watt's position to be so forthcoming with his views.  It is essential we do not ignore that.<\/p> <p>Potentially, we are being bounced into something that now looks as though it will cost billions rather than hundreds of millions because we are supposedly too far into a flawed process.  The Department has to question itself about how we could have ended up in a situation where there is only one bidder.  That does not lead to an optimum outcome.  The Social Democrats brought a motion to the House, which was passed, that the national development plan be reviewed.  There have been massive overruns on the national children's hospital.  The amount projected for the national broadband plan was not anything like the amount it is being projected to cost now.  We have also declared a climate emergency and we really need to reconfigure our priorities in that context.  We can only spend money once.  If this is the amount it will cost, we need to look at the national broadband plan and be honest about what cannot be done if we go ahead with it as proposed.<\/p> <p> We got a number of assurances about the amount of information that would be given to the D&aacute;il in advance of signing any contract.  What we are hearing now seems to be deviating from that.  Can the Minister give us an assurance about what we are going to see?  Will there be a D&aacute;il vote in advance of the signing of any proposed contract?  I also have a concern about how much due diligence has been done in respect of the entities involved.  Should this proceed, we certainly do not want to be back here doing an inquiry and saying we were told this and it did not work out.  We have to be given absolute assurances.  I hope this motion will pass and that we will have a publicly-owned network.  We need to be absolutely assured about the due diligence in respect of the entities involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300049#FFF00400","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571847300,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I am from the heart of rural Ireland, Ballynacargy, and I am acutely aware of the vital importance of the delivery of broadband to many hundreds of people who reside in areas like Rathowen, Legan, Ballymore, Drumraney, Carrickboy, Abbeyshrule, Milltown and so many other rural areas.  Many in those areas could set up telecottage-type industries and work productively from their homes.  I acknowledge the importance of this online infrastructure in sustaining and revitalising rural Ireland.  Although it seems it is too late to control the scandalous cost overrun of the national children's hospital, when built, the hospital will at least belong to the people of Ireland.  This project for the provision of a rural broadband network is costed at &euro;3 billion despite being originally estimated at &euro;500 million.  There is only one company remaining, Granahan McCourt, which is willing to implement the national broadband plan.  The deal that this single, monopoly bidder is being offered is incredible.  The preferred rural broadband bidder will get its money back within seven or eight years and will carry very little risk thereafter, while the State, which has invested &euro;3 billion, will have no ownership rights.  To ensure maximum control and maximum profit for Granahan McCourt, the State has agreed to nominate only one member of the national broadband board that will oversee the delivery of the project.  In the light of these figures, it is hardly surprising that the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recommended that the network when completed should remain in public ownership.<\/p>  <p>  The rural broadband strategy has been dogged by confusion and underestimation of costs since its inception.  Providing broadband to low-density rural households is inevitably costly but technology has moved on dramatically since the national broadband plan was formulated.  Since Granahan McCourt submitted its tender, two companies, Eir and Imagine, have announced their willingness to provide high-speed broadband to many of the households and businesses that do not have it.  Of the 540,000 premises which do not have high-speed broadband, Eir is offering to connect 80,000, while Imagine is offering to connect 320,000.  If Imagine can deliver on its promise, only 140,000 premises will remain to be connected by Granahan McCourt, which would result in an exorbitant cost per premises connected and would be unlikely to be commercially viable.  The connection costs for these remaining houses would then be so high that few would be willing to pay for the cost of connection.  While the Eir and Imagine proposals are based on existing technology, by the time the broadband network is built an emerging technology which does not require a wired network, low Earth orbit, LEO, satellites, may be delivering broadband at gigabit speed globally.  They could also play a role in Ireland's national broadband plan.  LEO satellites are an emerging disrupter in global Internet communications, which is now progressing rapidly.  If it goes ahead with the present broadband plan, the State may be committing &euro;3 billion to invest in technology that will soon be outdated and surpassed.<\/p>  <p>  At the communications committee debate in August last, Fine Gael tried to put through a motion calling for immediate implementation of the &euro;3 billion plan.  There is clearly an ideological commitment by the Government that wherever possible, the private sector should be allowed to reap the benefits of public investment.  We have seen this with Deputy Noonan encouraging vulture funds to acquire NAMA properties and ensuring that they pay no tax on the profits they are reaping.  Fine Gael is an enthusiastic supporter of public private partnerships, PPPs, where the Government bears all the risk and the private company gets all the profit.  We have seen this in the case of the Shannon tunnel and the last section of the M3, where the taxpayer must make up the revenues of private companies running these facilities if tolls do not reach a target level.  We seem to have learned nothing from the negative consequences of previous privatisations and PPPs.  The privatisation of Eircom is now largely blamed for the losses incurred by people who bought shares in the company.  A much more serious consequence was the loss of control of the network.  Eircom was asset-stripped, sold and resold and today its successor, Eir, owns a network of poles and ducts outside towns.  If the national broadband plan goes ahead, the State will have to pay Eir for access to them.  This will add hundreds of millions in additional costs to the rural broadband provision, which would not be incurred if the network was still State-owned.  Fianna F&aacute;il bears responsibility for that.  If the network was State-owned, it could have been expanded as part of the State's strategic infrastructure but Eir and its predecessor, Eircom, were interested only in maximising profits by increasing charges to existing customers and invested very little in the network.  <\/p>  <p>  A large part of the cost of this project will be profit for the venture capitalists who are providing some of the capital.  When built, the network can be sold to private equity companies and control of vital infrastructure will be lost.  As happened when Eircom was privatised, the broadband network can be managed so as to extract the maximum profit from those depending on it.  With no alternative supplier, the ball is at their foot.  When the M50 was being built, it was known from the outset that it would have to include a bridge across the Liffey valley.  I go home that way every evening.  The Government of the day decided that a motorway built at taxpayers' expense would have a toll bridge and the tolls on this bridge, instead of being used to fund the motorway, would be assigned to a private company that would fund the bridge.  National Toll Roads had recouped its investment in the West Link bridge within ten years and by 2007, it was earning more than the &euro;43 million it had invested in a single year.  The State was eventually forced to buy the bridge back at a cost of &euro;1.15 billion from National Toll Roads, which had built the bridge for &euro;58 million.  One could not make it up.  We are heading the same way with this.  The State will eventually have to buy back the rural broadband network from Granahan McCourt for a huge multiple of what the company has invested in it.  It is vital that we learn from the mistakes made in privatising Eircom and the fiasco of the West Link bridge.  We must retain the rural broadband network in public ownership.<\/p>  <p>  The argument I heard the Minister make that revisiting the Granahan McCourt plan would set back provision is specious.  If it had been known ten years ago that the cost of building the national children's hospital would eventually be ten times the original estimate, nobody would have accepted the argument that building should commence at once regardless of the escalation of cost.  The current proposal for rural broadband should be subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis and whatever scheme is implemented, ownership of the network should remain in the hands of the taxpayers who will bear all of the risk and a substantial part of the funding.  I am strongly fortified in my viewpoint, which no doubt is that of my party, that while PPPs were once the way to go, especially in the context of a severe economic downturn when Exchequers worldwide were empty, this no longer holds true.  There has been a significant turn back from PPPs as people and governments realise that they are a way of having the taxpayer carry all of the load and all of the risk while the developers are the non-risk takers scooping all of the profits.  If governments across Europe are shying away from PPPs, we should wake up, smell the coffee and join the band.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300050#GGG00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1571847300,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy forget about Pat Rabbitte?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300050#GGG00300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1571847300,"counter":536,"content":"<p>Pat Rabbitte was not there giving out money to National Toll Roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300050#GGG00400","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1571847300,"counter":537,"content":"<p>Or privatising Eircom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300050#GGG00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1571847300,"counter":538,"content":"<p>There has been great frustration expressed in the context of this debate.

Essentially it meant that servicing the critical mass remaining of what the State had left to divvy out would not be cost-effective.  There has also not been an adequate response to the advice of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has referred to the fact that some of this advice was blacked out, thus preventing access to public information, although we really know why the view of the Oireachtas committee was rejected, which seems to happen all the time with the Government.  The majority view here no longer seems to matter.  We have not received a proper answer to the question as to why the Government continued to proceed at a time when there was only one bidder left.  Essentially, it was not a competitive process, with bidder being a venture capitalist organisation.  We have not received adequate answers and are left with valuable State infrastructure in private hands.  <\/p>  <p>  Various speakers have referred to the Eircom debacle, from which we should surely have learned some lessons, and also from overspending in many other areas.  I certainly want to refer to the overspend on the national children's hospital project, as a vital project in my constituency will obviously be affected by it, the 96-bed unit at University Hospital Limerick, the most overcrowded hospital in the country.  It matter when there is an overspend because other projects suffer.  That is just one example that we cannot afford to allow linger any longer.  No adequate explanation has been offered as to why the Government continued to proceed down this road and why this vital piece of infrastructure will not remain in State hands.  As Deputy Penrose said, we may well end up having to buy it back, but we surely cannot go down that road now.  The Government has to consider the fact that we need this vital infrastructure in public ownership.<\/p>  <p>  On ideology, the same is happening in housing provision.  We have public land being given over to private companies.  That clearly is Government policy when what we should have is the retention of public land in public ownership to build affordable and social housing, but that is not happening either.  Ideology is clearly at work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300051#HHH00300","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1571847900,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach.<\/p>  <p>  I am struck by the irony as I listen to the debate, given that for the last couple of years Opposition parties have continuously accused the Government of being against, not in favour of, rural Ireland, yet it is the Government that is pushing for the delivery of high speed broadband to every house in the country.  The Government just does not understand is a comment I hear regularly.  The comment in my head is that it does not want to understand because Opposition parties want to set a certain narrative for political purposes.  Fine Gael plans to deliver high speed fibre broadband to every home, farm, business and school in rural Ireland.  It wants to do so for very good reasons as it does not believe we can afford to allow the digital divide to continue and there is no cheaper or quicker way to do it.  If we were to do as the Opposition asks and change approach, it would be people in rural Ireland who would be left behind without high speed fibre broadband.  The Government does not want to do that.  Historically, there was a legacy of under-investment in broadband provision by the State since a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government sold Telecom &Eacute;ireann in 1999, for which we are still paying the price.<\/p>  <p>  There is no question that the cost of the national broadband plan is high, but the cost and impact on rural Ireland of not implementing it would be even higher and bigger.  We need to put the cost of the plan in context.  Between 2002 and 2016 the State invested &euro;400 million in the roll-out of high speed broadband.  We will have invested &euro;36.9 billion in roads and &euro;10.8 billion in water infrastructure between 2002 and 2021.  It is vital that we now act to counteract the historical under-investment, even throughout the biggest boom the country has ever seen in the Celtic Tiger era.  The Government of the day decided to sell Telecom &Eacute;ireann, leaving it to the private sector to roll out high speed fibre broadband, but what did that sector do?  In order to make a profit, the companies involved cherry-picked the most populated areas.  They went for the towns and cities, leaving rural dwellers behind.  There are 540,000 premises, with 1.1 million people living in them.  We have the maps on which the 540,000 premises are clearly marked by the private sector, to which it will not deliver a service.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a very good reason we need the national broadband plan.  We need to progress the conversation.  Broadband provision is not about Netflix but about having a decent quality of life.  Because there are comparisons, people talk about broadband provision in the context of the rural electrification scheme.  People initially thought the purpose of the rural electrification scheme was to bring light to their houses.  They never envisaged the myriad uses to which electricity could be put, with sockets all around our houses to power an array of electronic devices.  They simply thought the purpose was to bring light to their houses and yards.  Similarly in the case of broadband, we cannot identify all of the uses to which it will be put in the future, but in respect of the rural electrification scheme, nobody in the country would dream of living in a house without electricity.  Similarly, we are not far from the time when no one will dream of living in a house without high-speed fibre broadband which is needed for online shopping, remote working and e-health services.  We will very quickly move into a space where it will become a necessity, not a luxury.  If we do not invest to ensure every home in rural Ireland has access to high-speed broadband, we will see the abandonment of rural Ireland, something about which many in this House are genuinely concerned.  That is why we have Project Ireland 2040, the biggest investment by the State in rural Ireland, through the town and village renewal and urban and rural regeneration schemes, of which broadband provision is a key part.  We do not want people to move from small rural communities to live in villages and bigger towns because they are the only places in which they can have the quality of life in their home that they seek.  <\/p>  <p>  What is contained in the motion would set us back a mile, drive the digital divide and leave those living in rural Ireland behind.  The opportunities are in having flexible remote working arrangements and smart health programmes, with online GP, nursing and medical monitoring services, particularly for older people who live in isolated areas. The opportunities are also in having cloud-based and connected devices, smart farming programmes for those involved in the agriculture sector, digital learning programmes, reliable electronic payment and booking services, as well as online shopping which could be seen as a luxury but which in many ways is a necessity for so many.  The point is that for too long we have had a muddying of the waters, with the Opposition trying to state this is an awful thing to do, but this is the right investment for rural Ireland.  The biggest mistake would be not driving on with it.  I cannot stress enough that at its special meeting in September the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party unanimously passed motion stating we needed to see delivery of the national broadband plan as soon as possible.  As chairman of the party, I back that motion and want to see the plan delivered as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300051#HHH00400","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1571847900,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Having listened to the debate it is clear that there is support on all sides of the House for delivering high speed broadband to the 1.1 million people living in the national broadband plan intervention area.  My fellow Clare man, Deputy Harty, asked three questions.  He asked when the contract would be signed?  I hope it will be signed before the end of the year.  He asked what the cost would be?  It will be &euro;2.14 billion, plus VAT, with a contingency figure of &euro;480 million.  He asked what the cost to the consumer would be?  It will be the same as that of the retail offering in the commercial area, with a &euro;100 connection fee for retailers.  <\/p>  <p>  Access to a high speed broadband service is important tor everyone in Ireland, no matter where he or she lives.  High quality, reliable connectivity allows us to harness the economic and social benefits of participating in a digitally-enabled society.  When it comes to the availability of high speed broadband in Ireland, there is a growing urban-rural digital divide.  The national broadband plan aims to eliminate that digital divide and ensure it will not re-emerge in the decades ahead.  The clear commitment of this and the previous Government is that everyone in Ireland should have access to high speed broadband.  The Government has encouraged investment by the telecommunications sector.<\/p> <p>Commercial operators have invested more than &euro;2.75 billion in upgrading, expanding and modernising their networks in the past five years.  In 2012 fewer than one third of premises had access to high speed broadband.  The investment made since by commercial operators has resulted in three quarters of the population having access to high speed broadband, which is very welcome.  It makes it all the more important that we move ahead without delay with the national broadband plan to make sure those in rural areas will not be left further behind.  Without the national broadband plan, many homes, schools and businesses will be left behind in a two-tier digital society.  <br\/><br\/>While there has been a lot of focus on the ownership question, the reality is that the decision to divest the State of its telecommunications infrastructure was taken 20 years ago.  Against that reality, the national broadband plan cannot result in a new State-owned network emerging.  Instead, connectivity will be achieved by leveraging existing infrastructure to the greatest degree possible.  That is the most efficient and cost-effective way of bridging the connectivity gap.  Connectivity will be delivered by deploying fibre on poles and in ducts owned by Eir or the ESB and by locating equipment in exchanges owned by Eir or the MANs.  NBI will own fibre cable and electronic equipment deployed on rented infrastructure.  There will not be a single network owned by a private company or the State.  <br\/><br\/>The value in the national broadband plan to the State is that it guarantees the provision of a future-proofed, high speed broadband service for 1.1 million people who would otherwise be left behind.  The gap-funded model will achieve this, while incentivising NBI to invest continually to improve the service.  There are 1.1 million people, 56,000 farms, 44,000 businesses and 674 schools waiting on the plan which will ensure those living and working in the intervention area will be able to avail of the many and varied benefits of high speed broadband.  It will enable the creation of new enterprises and businesses to expand.  New remote working opportunities will increase the talent pool available to employers.  High speed connectivity will create new opportunities for education, smart farming, tourism and health.  It will also be critical in promoting more balanced regional development and achieving the goals of the climate action plan.  High speed connectivity for all is a goal we share.  Delaying the national broadband plan, or steering it off course, would serve only to delay achieving this objective.  It would disadvantage those living and working in predominantly rural areas covered by the State intervention area.  We have spent the time necessary to consider the strategy and develop the plan.  This is the time to move forward to the delivery phase.  It is time to tell the 1.1 million people living and working in the intervention area that we will not accept a digitally divided Ireland.  I urge the Members of this House to send a clear signal to them that the national broadband plan should proceed to the deployment phase without delay, bringing much needed connectivity to rural Ireland.  The time for talking is over.  The time for implementation is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300051#HHH00500","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571848500,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague Deputy Sherlock for bringing forward this important motion and allowing us once again to debate the pros and cons of this vital national resource.  I thank all of the speakers who contributed, particularly those from rural areas, who said, as we all agree, that broadband was totally necessary to be able to lead a modern life, run a modern business or farm, have a modern family home and allow children to use the resource.  There is no disagreement on either side of the House on the necessity to have broadband in every community, including, insofar as possible, homes in very remote areas.  Obviously, the technology will improve and change.  However, it is arrogant in the extreme for Fine Gael Members to stand up with their Independent partners and say they will not review the costing or learn from all of the committee discussions, other discussions and television debates.  Who is the man who really says, when he hears costs that he regards as amazing, that he will not review them on the grounds that the money is not his own but that of the public?  This is not a sound economic decision.<\/p>  <p>  In modern accounting there is a process called zero-based budgeting, whereby one feeds in all of the data in reviewing the budget to look at everything again.  Fine Gael's form of zero-based budgeting is actually zero budgeting because it is stating, with a degree of arrogance, that it does not need to look at the figures and does not care about them.  I find this absolutely astonishing.<\/p>  <p>  A really famous quotation from Hamlet reads: \"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.\"  It screams to the high heavens that there is something wrong with this contract.  The very respected and careful man with the money, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has seriously questioned its value.  As a senior public servant, he is required to call it out.  In the past, somebody such as Deputy Richard Bruton, now the Minister, would have defended a public servant who would have called something out in all honesty as he or she saw it.  It is not pleasant for politicians holding office to be told such a thing by civil servants, but it means that, at the least, a serious, detailed examination is required of all that has happened since the figures were first worked out.  Changes in technology and the fact that further changes are coming should be considered.  It is also a matter of examining the history of assets that are not publicly owned but that are vital to the public for their lives, businesses, schools and community centres.  This is a valid and sensible approach.  The Government should not be so arrogant as to state it will not go there.<\/p>  <p>  We know from the recent discussions between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, that the Taoiseach has been testing to great effect some of his knowledge of the classics on Mr. Johnson who is a bit of a Greek scholar.  There is one statement in the classics that every politician should know, that is, that after hubris, or arrogance, comes nemesis.  That is actually what the Government is facing, except by the time it happens it is unlikely to be picking up the pieces.  Once again, it will be the taxpayer who will do so.  As the taxpayer pays, rural areas will pay on the double for a project that clearly requires re-examination, recasting entry budgeting.  I question proceeding given all of what we now know. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of this argument, there has been a lot of discussion about the benefit of public private partnerships.  It is an important discussion in Ireland.  I have never been a fan of public private partnerships because they are costly and expensive.  Very often they cost more than a public investment held in public ownership, as the motion demands.  They cost an awful lot more.  That is because Governments, including in small countries like Ireland, are very large institutions.  They can borrow at a very low rate by comparison with the private sector.  With a public private partnership, however, there is a private sector investment vehicle.  Essentially, the private sector has to offer a significant return to the investors in the private financial model which costs way above what it costs most governments on the planet.  That is the basic problem with public private partnerships.<\/p>  <p>  With public private partnerships comes the ownership model.<\/p> <p>The problem with that is that, when the 25 years of ownership under the contract finish, or perhaps even beforehand, a project can be sold off to someone else.  We are living in a highly financialised world where the financial model counts enormously in terms of security.  The Government has chosen a financialised model.  Against all the rules, we know that there were contacts from the final bidders in the project.  Initially, there were a number of bidders.  For various reasons that I will not recite, they fell away until we were left with just one.  We then heard about wining and dining, dinners and contacts, a series of events that led many people to feel that the relationship between the bidder and the contractor - the Government - was too intimate and deeply inappropriate, so much so that one Minister resigned as a consequence.  We accept the bona fides of everyone in the House, but there are serious questions about the way in which the contract proceeded.  We do not want to commit another couple of million euro to some judge down the road to offer us a detailed evaluation of why this contract was over the top.<\/p> <p> Deputy Heydon spoke about the need for broadband in rural Ireland.  There is not a person in the country, and certainly not in the Houses, who does not accept that need or does not want it  happen.  Today, I read the announcement in respect of Strokestown Park House and the further development of the National Famine Museum there by making the most up-to-date interactive technology available for use by adult visitors and, in particular, schoolchildren.<\/p> <p> The Fine Gael line is that one should essentially throw caution to the wind, ignore all of the economic evaluations of the project that raise significant questions and just go with it because it is only &euro;3 billion.

The Labour motion is a genuine attempt to help the Government to rescue and finance this important project properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK00700","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571849100,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571849100,"counter":554,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 24 October 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK00900","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1571849100,"counter":555,"content":"<p>And no fingers on any button.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK01000","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1571849100,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Flashing red buttons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK01100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1571849100,"counter":557,"content":"<p>We could use the Internet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK01200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1571849100,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Would we use broadband over electronic voting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK01300","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n Seanad - Message from Seanad","time":1571849100,"counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK01400"},{"type":"speech","time":1571849100,"counter":560,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Family Law Bill 2019 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK01500","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Finance Bill 2019: Order for Second Stage","time":1571849100,"counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK01600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571849100,"counter":562,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571849100,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK01800","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571849100,"counter":564,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Finance Bill 2019: Second Stage","time":1571849100,"counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK02000"},{"type":"speech","time":1571849100,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  Two weeks ago, I made my Budget Statement and outlined the many challenges that our economy had gone through.  Despite those challenges and issues, we have economic growth that is broadly based, public capital investment will increase by 22% and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.3%.  Tax revenues are largely in line with forecasts and we expect to meet our revised target of &euro;58.6 billion this year.  The Department of Finance is forecasting GDP growth of 5.5% for this year, up from 3.9% in the stability programme update.  We have eliminated the deficit and are projecting a surplus of 0.2% of national income.<\/p>  <p>  That said, we cannot for a moment underestimate the challenge that Brexit poses to the economy.  In the event that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement, we will continue to build on this surplus.  Brexit is the main immediate threat to the Irish economy.  It is a threat to the wider European economy and, ironically, it is a threat to the UK economy, in particular the Northern Ireland economy.  Similar to today's events, that communities are grappling with the consequences of planned job losses in the coming weeks, months and years reminds us of the many challenges materialising before us.  We find ourselves facing an uncertain situation over which we have relatively little influence.  This is all the more reason to take care with policies that we can control and influence.<\/p>  <p>  Due to recent actions, we are in a strong position to mitigate some of the worst effects of Brexit if we are forced to do so.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, we will intervene in a sustained and meaningful way to support jobs and our economy.  We have a package of &euro;1.2 billion to be called on if needed.  If we must intervene in this way, our surplus will move to a deficit of 0.6% of national income.  We hope that the withdrawal agreement is ratified, but it is only prudent to remain cautious until it has taken place.  This is the context within which budget 2020 was framed, and the Bill sets out the legislative provisions required to give effect to the budget.<\/p>  <p>  I will begin with income tax and enterprise supports.  The Bill provides for a number of significant enterprise taxation supports by way of broadening access to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, the employment investment incentive, EII, and the research and development tax credit.  The Bill extends the special assignee relief programme, SARP, and the foreign earnings deduction, FED, to the end of 2022.  The Bill further provides for income tax measures announced on budget day, applying increases to the home carer's credit and the earned income tax credit.  It also provides for the extension of the help-to-buy scheme to the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The House will be aware of, and has adopted, the decisions that I have recommended in respect of carbon prices.  There is broad support to move to the target of &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  However, we know that this change will not be easy for everyone.  Instead of a large increase in any one year, therefore, I am committing to a &euro;6 increase as a first step towards the 2030 target.  It is my ambition to increase this move each year.  This &euro;6 increase applied from budget night to auto fuels, but I have decided to delay its application to other fuels until May 2020 after the winter heating season.  The increase will raise &euro;90 million in 2020, all of which will be ring-fenced to fund new climate action measures that will protect the most vulnerable in society, support sustainable mobility projects, deliver new agri-environmental schemes and invest in our low-carbon future.<\/p> <p>This approach is supported by the Climate Change Advisory Council, the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action and the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change, which also point in that direction.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly summarise other climate-related tax changes.  I am replacing the 1% diesel surcharge introduced last year with a nitrogen oxide, NOx, emissions-based surcharge, to apply from 1 January 2020.  In addition, in this Bill, I am introducing an environmental rationale to benefit-in-kind for commercial vehicles from 2023.  The Bill will also extend the benefit-in-kind zero rate on electric vehicles to 2022 and extend VRT reliefs for conventional and plug-in hybrids to 2020, subject to CO<sub>2<\/sub>thresholds.  The Bill will reduce qualifying CO<sub>2<\/sub>thresholds for reliefs in respect of capital allowances and VAT reclaim on commercial vehicles, and provide additional relief through the diesel rebate scheme to hauliers to compensate that sector for the increased cost of fuel.  I am equalising electricity tax rates for business and non-business.<br\/><br\/>One of the main strengths of Ireland's corporate tax regime is the certainty we offer investors through a stable, consistent and transparent policy regime.  Investment decisions that bring jobs to Ireland are long-term decisions and, therefore, certainty is important.  It also worth reflecting that often the problems in the international tax system have come not from the actions of governments but from advisers and business designing complex plans to exploit mismatches or gaps in legislation.  Those days must come to an end.  While governments worldwide are doing their part but, globally, tax advisers, lawyers, and the professional services industry must also play their part.  It is in the long-term interests of all.  The Bill includes a number of significant changes to address the issue of tax avoidance.  I am making changes to Irish real estate funds, IREFs, to address aggressive tax planning activities identified by Revenue on examination of IREF accounts filed this year.  I outlined in my Budget Statement that analysis of these structures is ongoing, and I intend to make some further amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that the aggressive activities of some entities do not negatively impact on bona fide, third-party lending in vehicles funding much-needed development projects.  I am also making amendments to the real estate investment trust, REIT, regime and to the taxation of securitisation vehicles to strengthen anti-abuse measures and ensure appropriate taxation is collected.  I am also updating existing transfer pricing rules and extending their scope and application.  The changes take account of the latest 2017 version of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines and significantly extend the scope of the rules in line with the recommendations in the Coffey review.<br\/><br\/>As part of our commitment to implementing the anti-tax avoidance directive, ATAD, I am introducing new anti-avoidance measures this year in the form of ATAD-compliant, anti-hybrid rules.  The purpose of anti-hybrid rules is to prevent arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an instrument or entity under the tax laws of two or more jurisdictions to generate a tax advantage.  They will apply to all corporate taxpayers from 1 January 2020.  The Bill makes amendments to the treatment of investment limited partnerships, ILPs, and puts the long-standing treatment of stock borrowing and repurchase transactions on a legislative footing.  These amendments are being introduced in conjunction with the introduction of ATAD anti-hybrid rules to ensure that the existing treatment of ILPs is clear in legislation.  As well as tackling avoidance, these reforms enhance the legitimacy of our corporate tax regime internationally.<br\/><br\/>I will now refer to each Part.  Part 1 deals with income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax and the universal social charge, USC.  Section 1 is the interpretation section.  Section 2 provides that the reduced rate of universal social charge, USC, for full medical cardholders whose individual annual income does not exceed &euro;60,000.  It will be extended for a further year until the end of the 2020 tax year.  Section 3 deals with the increased value of the home carer credit.  Section 4 deals with the earned income credit.  Section 5 deals with benefit-in-kind on employer-provided vehicles.  The exemption for electric cars and vans with a market value of less than &euro;50,000 is extended to 31 December 2022.  A new charging regime for employer-provided cars will take effect from 1 January 2023.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 extends an exemption from tax for payments made to compensate individuals for expenses incurred in the donation of a kidney to also include those who donate a lobe of a liver.  Section 7 makes a technical amendment to the Magdalen restorative justice <i>ex gratia <\/i>scheme.  Sections 8 to 10 deal with SARP, KEEP and FED.  Section 11 seeks to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>for qualifying UK residents by allowing them to retain entitlement to certain allowances.  Sections 12 to 14 deal with payments, including certain payments to foster parents, training allowances and student grants.  Section 15 extends the help-to-buy scheme.  Section 16 provides tax relief for pension contributions made by a company to occupational pension schemes set up for employees of another company in certain circumstances.  Section 17 extends the living city initiative.  Section 18 is the adjustment of the qualifying CO<sub>2<\/sub>thresholds for capital allowances.<br\/><br\/>Section 19 makes two technical amendments to the general rules on deductions for tax purposes.  Section 20 includes Children's Health Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, which is a designated activity company, DAC, in the list of specified non-commercial State-sponsored bodies that qualify for exemption from certain tax provisions under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 21 amends section 845C to extend the treatment afforded to additional tier 1 instruments to comparable instruments with equivalent characteristics issued by companies other than regulated financial institutions.  Section 22 deals with certain corporation tax measures.  Section 23 increases the rate of dividend withholding tax, DWT, from the standard rate of income tax of 20% to a rate of 25% and increases the rate for distributions to certain non-residents in a similar manner.  Section 24 amends Chapter 2 of Part 29 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of additional supports for micro and small companies.<br\/><br\/>Section 25 makes a number of amendments in respect of the Ell scheme.  I covered sections 26 to 31 earlier.  Section 32 amends section 1035A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 33 inserts Chapter 3 into Part 28 of the Act.  It relates to the tax treatment of stock borrowing and repurchase, repo, arrangements.  Section 34 amends section 604B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The section provides for capital gains tax relief for the purposes of farm restructuring.  Section 35 amends section 616(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide interpretations for the purposes of Chapter 1 of Part 20 of the Act.  Section 36 amends section 621 to correct an inconsistency in the treatment of an allowable loss in comparison with a chargeable gain.  Section 37 makes changes to the exit tax.<br\/><br\/>Part 2 deals with excise.  Section 38 confirms the budget day increase.  Section 39 confirms the budget increase in the carbon component of mineral oil tax on mineral oils used as auto fuels from 9 October 2019.  Section 40 makes a number of amendments to the Finance Act 1999 to bring national law concerning fuel oil used for private pleasure navigation in line with EU rules.  Section 41 provides for an enhanced relief under the diesel rebate scheme.<\/p> <p>Section 42 provides for an increase to the production threshold for eligibility to claim 50% relief from alcohol products tax for beer brewed in small breweries.  Section 43 provides for the equalisation of the rates of electricity tax referred to earlier.  Sections 44 and 45 provide for an increase to the natural gas carbon tax.<\/p> <p> Section 46 amends section 64 and section 77 of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 2002 and inserts a new section 68A to that Act to provide a relief from betting duty and betting intermediary duty.<\/p> <p> Section 47 amends the definition of the European Union in respect of Italy to exclude certain territories.  This amendment transposes a legal measure that has been approved at EU level.<\/p> <p> Sections 48 and 49 refer to the nitrogen oxide emissions that I referred to earlier.  Section 50 deals with extension of the vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief for hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids until 31 December 2020.<\/p> <p> Part 3 of the Bill deals with VAT.  The first section is the interpretation section.<\/p> <p> The second section, which is section 52, reduces the carbon dioxide threshold from 156 g to 140 g per kilometre for business vehicles qualifying for a VAT deduction.  The section also removes the possibility of deducting VAT on services used to effect a transfer of the ownership of goods within the scope of transfer of business relief.<\/p> <p> Section 53 amends section 108 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 to ensure that the powers contained in section 108 can be used in respect of mutual assistance requests received by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p> Section 54 amends Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 by inserting a new paragraph 3A to provide that food supplements will be subject to VAT at a rate of 13.5%.  I should make it clear that foods for specific groups such as infant formula, vitamins and minerals such as folic acid licensed as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and fortified foods such as fortified cereals, will continue to benefit from the zero rating for VAT purposes.<\/p> <p> Part 4 deals with stamp duties.  Section 55 is the interpretation section.<\/p> <p> Section 56 amends Schedule 1 to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to give effect to the budget increase in the rate of stamp duty applying to conveyances or transfers and lease premiums of non-residential property from 6% to 7.5%  It amends section 83D to take account of the new rate of 7.5%.  The 6% rate will continue to apply for purchasers or lessees with binding contracts in place before 9 October and where the sale or lease is executed before 1 January 2020.  Sections 57 and 58 provide that Gibraltar-regulated insurers will continue to be liable to the current levies on insurance policies on their Irish business in the event of the UK leaving the EU.<\/p> <p> Section 59 amends the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to maintain the fixed annual levy of &euro;150 million.  The levy is charged on the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, paid by the relevant financial institutions in a series of base years.  This measure came into effect on budget night.<\/p> <p> Section 60 imposes a stamp duty charge of 1% where the acquisition of a company is effected by means of a particular type of scheme of arrangement under Part 9.  The usual stamp duty charge in respect of the sale or transfer of shares did not apply, as this type of arrangement does not involve a conveyance or transfer on sale.  This measure came into effect on budget night.<\/p> <p> Part 5 deals with the capital acquisitions tax.  Section 61 is an interpretation section.<\/p> <p> Section 62 amends the section of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, which deals with the information to be supplied to Revenue and the Probate Office.  Section 63 amends section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, which provides for an exemption from inheritance tax for beneficiaries inheriting certain dwelling houses.  Section 64 increases the group A tax-free threshold from &euro;320,000 to &euro;335,000.<\/p> <p> Part 6 is the final part and deals with miscellaneous matters.  Section 65 is the interpretation section.<\/p> <p> Section 66 gives effect to certain provisions of an EU directive to introduce a mandatory disclosure regime for certain cross-border transactions.  Section 67 makes several amendments to the tax appeal procedures contained in Part 40A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 68 will allow the collection of disputed tax to be suspended in cases subject to a mutual agreement procedure.  Section 69 removes the requirement that the hard copy of an electronic tax return should be approved by Revenue.  Section 70 allows the Revenue Commissioners to reduce a PAYE assessment downwards without the taxpayer having to formally appeal.  Section 71 amends section 1001 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to allow entities to which a fixed charge on book debts has been transferred to notify Revenue of the transfer.  Section 72 amends a Schedule to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which lists all international tax agreements entered into by Ireland.  Section 73 and Schedule 2 provide for minor technical amendments to a selection of Bills.  Section 74 deals with the care and management of taxes and duties.  Section 75 contains provisions related to the Short Title, construction and commencement of the Bill.<\/p> <p> As is customary with the Finance Bill, there is still a number of small matters under consideration that I may bring forward on Committee Stage.  I hope that the debate on the important provisions contained in the Bill can be conducted in its typically constructive way.  I will always listen to other views and to suggestions to improve the Bill, and to Committee Stage amendments.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300053#KKK02100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571850300,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2019.  It was nearly 12 months ago that our party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty, decided to extend the confidence and supply arrangement to ensure that there was no general election in this country in 2019.  I welcome the Brexit agreement reached recently.  I commend all those who have worked so diligently, patiently and professionally in Ireland's best interests over the last number of years on Brexit.  I commend the negotiating team in Brussels, led by Michel Barnier, and our European counterparts who stood by Ireland and did all that was possible to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.  Regardless of what happens in the coming days, weeks and months, there is no mistaking that Brexit still represents one of the challenges of our age.  The uncertainty, so pervasive across the water last December, persists to this day.  As we sit here, we still do not know entirely what will happen by 31 October and we do not know precisely what kind of Brexit will materialise in the end, if any at all.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il decided to facilitate the passage of this budget, and subsequently this Finance Bill, because it was clear to us that Ireland needed a stable Government at this time.  We must all continue to do everything in our power to protect jobs from the cold reality of Brexit.  People up and down the country, in urban and rural areas alike, are rightly concerned over the future of their livelihoods when Brexit, no matter what form it takes, materialises.  A no-deal Brexit, though now unlikely, is still possible.  That means the assumptions underpinning this budget still stand.  With more than &euro;16 billion in goods exported from Ireland to the UK, a no-deal Brexit would represent a step change in Ireland's economic relationship with the UK.  A no-deal Brexit brings with it job losses and a return to deficit spending.  It will not only lead to east-west checks on goods moving between our two countries but would also inevitably mean checks going north and south.<\/p>  <p>  The Brexit deal announced last week is no doubt better than a no-deal scenario.  However, it would be a mistake to call a Brexit under this existing deal a soft seamless Brexit.  A hard Brexit is still a possible outcome, especially when one considers the changes from the deal agreed with Theresa May, in that the UK will, in effect, leave a customs union in a scenario where no free trade arrangement is agreed, so tariffs could potentially apply from the end of 2020.<\/p>  <p>It will be difficult for those businesses importing goods from Great Britain as the reality of regulatory divergence comes to pass.  At the end of it all, we could be back here again at the end of 2020, still finding ourselves on the precipice of the UK walking away, essentially without a deal.  Free trade agreements can take many years to finalise and oftentimes can take over a decade.  Yet as it stands under this deal, the EU and the UK will have just 12 months.  I do not believe anyone thinks that is a realistic timeframe.  Brexit is not going away, regardless of whether this deal is ratified by the House of Commons or not.  I would urge the Minister and the Government to be forthcoming when time permits with an economic impact assessment of the deal reached last week and what that means for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>At the outset of negotiations for budget 2020, Fianna F&aacute;il wanted assurances the industries most impacted by a no-deal Brexit would be protected insofar as is possible.  Those sectors are as follows: the tourism sector, which relies heavily on UK tourists coming here and spending their hard-earned cash; the agrifood sector, which exports most of its produce to the UK; and the small businesses throughout the country that find it far more challenging to adapt to an ever-changing environment.  Fianna F&aacute;il insisted these sectors were given the support they needed to get through the potentially choppy waters of a no-deal Brexit scenario.  While the budget day announcement of a Brexit fund, principally for these three sectors, is to be welcomed, we have concerns about whether this funding can be deployed in a timely manner if a no-deal Brexit comes to pass.  The various loan schemes announced in the past year or so have not had a significant uptake.  They are tied up in too much red tape to be deployed in an efficient manner.  Of the funding announced on budget day for a no-deal Brexit, it is unclear whether it has been granted state aid approval.  Perhaps as the finance Bill moves through the Oireachtas, the Minister can provide clarity on that issue.  It is critical that if a no-deal Brexit were to materialise at the end of this month or at the end of January, that this funding be deployed quickly and effectively to the businesses that need it most.<br\/><br\/>I would like to know what happens if this deal is ratified by the House of Commons.  Based on our understanding of the Minister's speech on budget day, the &euro;650 million in funding will not be deployed if a no-deal Brexit is prevented.  Aside from Brexit, Ireland faces many risks in the coming 12 months and beyond.  Growth in our economy is set to slow, regardless of Brexit happening next year.  Globally, we are seeing more protectionism and a ratcheting up of trade tensions.  As we speak, tariffs are set to increase on certain goods being exported from the EU to the US.  As a small and open economy, Ireland is particularly vulnerable to changes in global trade.<br\/><br\/>In my budget day speech, I outlined the risks Ireland faces in terms of our reliance on corporation tax receipts.  We know 45% of our receipts in 2018 come from just ten companies.  Undoubtedly, these companies are all foreign-owned multinationals.  That is about &euro;4.7 billion in tax from ten companies alone.  Let us be in no doubt the global corporate tax regime is changing rapidly, and this has the potential to have very significant impacts on Ireland.  The OECD has recently released details of the new base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, roadmap that could change the way corporation tax rights are allocated between countries and could well pave the way for a global minimum effective tax rate for companies.  While Fianna F&aacute;il will always defend our 12.5% corporate tax rate, there is little doubt these changes will reduce its effectiveness in attracting foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland.  In the past 24 hours alone, we have seen moe than 800 job losses confirmed in Shannon and in my constituency in Cork South-Central, so there is no room whatsoever for complacency.<br\/><br\/>We need to rebalance the economy towards the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector.  We will always support the FDI that comes to Ireland and we need to work hard to continue to win new business for our country.  However, we also need to ensure we have a supportive tax and enterprise environment for SMEs throughout our land.  The Minister announced various changes to the KEEP scheme, the employment and investment incentive scheme, EIIS, the SARP scheme, the foreign earnings deduction scheme and the research and development tax credit.  These changes, I hope, will reduce the amount of red tape and open these incentives to more firms, whether they are pre-trading start ups or developed companies seeking to grow.<br\/><br\/>While I welcome the changes announced, I regret to say we have been here before.  Tax schemes are proposed that in principle would assist SMEs, but when we get down to the nitty gritty in the finance Bill, what was proposed as a tax incentive can turn into an administrative nightmare.  Business owners applying for these schemes need to put in a lot of hard work or spend a large amount of money on expensive tax consultants and accountants.  The logical conclusion therefore, is that SMEs will sometimes walk away and not apply for these reliefs.  Take the KEEP scheme for example.  It was sought by industry for quite some time.  SMEs, particularly in the tech industry, were looking for a mechanism by which they could compete with larger companies for talent.  In budget 2018, the Minister first announced the KEEP scheme and the subsequent finance Bill placed that scheme into law.  The hope at the time was that the scheme would do what it said on the tin.  Unfortunately, the reality was different.  In budget 2018, it was anticipated the KEEP scheme would be a game changer for many of these firms.  However, we stand here today and only 87 employees have signed up for it.  I note the changes to the various tax schemes announced by the Minister on budget day, but we must ensure the provisions in this finance Bill do exactly what they are supposed to do and help, not hinder SMEs to progress and grow.<br\/><br\/>I note too the areas that were not covered in this budget.  The self-employed are still waiting to be treated equally with PAYE workers.  We are seeing some progress again in this budget, but we are not seeing equalisation.  The entrepreneurial relief has been left unchanged.  As the UK gets ready to leave the EU, our relief stands in contrast to the UK offering, and not in a positive light.  We still have the lifetime limit of only &euro;1 million, which is paltry when compared to the &pound;10 million limit that operates in the UK.  The capital gains tax, CGT, rate in general stands as among the highest in the EU at 33%.  I note just last weekend in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>, the Irish Medtech Association made it clear Ireland's high capital gains tax rate is proving a big challenge for the sector.  According to that article, there has been a notable increase in the number of entrepreneurs looking to invest abroad due to our CGT environment.  Not only do we need more progress on entrepreneurial relief, we also need to see progress on the headline CGT rate.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the introduction of the <i>de minimis<\/i>relief for the betting duty.  l, along with many other Deputies, raised issues around the application of betting duty last year during the budget and the finance Bill.  What has been announced does not go far enough and it will not stem the tide we are witnessing of small and independent bookmaking firms having to close many outlets.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the issue of VAT on food supplements.  I note section 54 of the Bill, which moves to provide that food supplements will be subject to VAT at a rate of 13.5%.  The story behind the VAT treatment of food supplements is a long one.  Food has a 0% rate applied to it, and food supplements were previously also treated in this way.  That is the historical context.  Back in 2018, issues were raised with many of us on how the Revenue Commissioners was treating food supplements at a regional level for the purposes of VAT.  There seemed to be confusion and inconsistent treatment on what was food and what was a food supplement and what was the difference.  I raised this in last year's finance Bill.  We made it clear then this was an emerging issue that had to be dealt with.  At the time the Minister accepted there was an issue and committed to having it reviewed in the tax strategy papers.  After the commitment was given, the Revenue Commissioners made a separate decision and indicated that from the end of March 2019, food supplements would be subject to the 23% VAT rate.  Its determination in this regard stems from its contention that there is no specific reference in legislation that warranted the 0% treatment for food supplements.  This was a huge change for the industry and instantly put many businesses at risk of closure.  At that time, along with others, we called on the Revenue Commissioners to put off the application of the 23% VAT rate, pending the outcome of the work of the tax strategy group, TSG.  It did not help matters when the Taoiseach rose to his feet in this House and referred to food supplements as &quot;snake oil.&quot;  The Taoiseach's glib response was insulting to the people who use food supplements and the businesses that sell them.  Thankfully, at the time, the Revenue Commissioners agreed to defer its decision until a public consultation took place and the tax strategy group had an opportunity to examine the issue.  The issue, as it stands, revolves around the reason a zero rate of VAT was applied to food supplements.  One side of the debate argues the Revenue Commissioners originally deemed food supplements to be food. which under legislation, is zero rated for VAT.  The Revenue Commissioners argued this was a concession, though it only started using that term in the past year or so, and therefore, in its view, there is no basis in legislation for food supplements to be zero rated.  Consulting with the sector, I have been briefed in detail on the state of affairs.  I have seen documents released under the Freedom of Information Act 2014, which indicate food supplements were classified by the Revenue Commissioners as food products.  I understand this case will end up in the courts next year and we await the outcome of that process. I understand the Revenue Commissioners is independent and cannot be instructed by this House or the Government except of course through the laws we enact here.<\/p> <p>The Minister might clarify why he is not in a position to legislate for food supplements to be zero rated.  I have no doubt this issue will be debated at length on Committee Stage.  Why was the particular rate selected?  Why was the 9% VAT rate, which sits within our VAT code, not selected?<\/p> <p> A legacy issue has also resulted in confusion.  Many businesses have applied a zero rate of VAT and were cleared as being tax compliant by the Revenue Commissioners.  Suddenly, Revenue changed its view and these companies found they had large tax bills.  They received threatening letters and their businesses were put at risk.  We need this issue to be dealt with in a comprehensive and fair manner because it has been all over the shop until now.<\/p> <p> Here we are again in 2019 having to close loopholes for certain fund structures operating in Ireland.  No matter how many amendments we make to the law, these funds continue to be one step ahead of the curve.  Highly paid lawyers and accountants are continuously finding ways of extracting money out of these funds without paying significant taxes or any tax at all.  First, we had the section 110 structure that we and others highlighted over time.  Loans with artificially high interest rates were used to extract money out of these funds without tax being paid.  We always seem to be a number of steps behind the curve and we desperately need a mechanism that identifies these aggressive tax structures to close the loopholes much quicker or, ideally, ensure we design laws whereby they are not there in the first place.<\/p> <p> I welcome the changes made in the budget on IREFs and REITs.  These funds are earning large profits in Ireland and they need to be taxed appropriately.  The introduction of limitations on interest expenses for IREFs based on debt-to-property costs and on an income-to-interest ratio is to be welcomed.  The system has also tightened for REITs.  Under the legislation, proceeds distributed from the disposal of a rental property will be subject to DWT.  These two anti-avoidance measures alone are projected to bring in &euro;80 million a year.  One must ask how much would have been brought in if these loopholes had been identified and closed much earlier.  We need to deal with this matter comprehensively on Committee Stage.  The Minister has indicated he intends to table amendments and we will study them closely.<\/p> <p> The home carer's tax credit was again increased in the budget and we very much welcome this.  It was a key issue for us in the confidence and supply agreement.  It has increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,600 and this is to be warmly welcomed.  In the past, I have raised the issue of what I regard as a low drawdown of this particular credit.  Revenue has made some progress in automatically extending the credit to people entitled to it but I continue to come across people whom I believe are entitled to it but who are not claiming it because they are simply not aware of it.  We need to deal with this issue.<\/p> <p> I want to raise the issue of how VRT is applied to hybrid vehicles.  I welcome that the Minister has pushed the proposed VRT changes until 2021.  The new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure, WLTP, while welcome, would distort the current VRT system and reform will be needed.  It would counterproductively penalise people buying newer cleaner cars.  We need to take time to fully look at the impact of the WLTP changes and then reform the VRT system and widen the bands in a manner that is appropriate for 2021.<\/p> <p> Section 50 makes a subtle change to the VRT rules that could have a significant adverse impact on hybrids.  It stipulates that hybrid electric vehicles with CO2 emissions in excess of 80 g\/km will not qualify for VRT relief.  With a new VRT system coming into place in 2021, this is an issue that will impact 2020 sales only.  According to the people in the industry with whom I have discussed this, 70% of hybrids sold in Ireland are above this threshold and, therefore, in 2020 will not qualify for the VRT relief the Minister is extending on a restricted basis.  The real issue is that for the first quarter of 2020 cars have been ordered and are in the system.  If people in the industry had known this change was coming they could have changed the product mix being brought to the Irish market to ensure more cars qualified for the VRT relief.  We will discuss this issue with the Minister in detail on Committee Stage.  He should consider pushing it out by a couple of months to allow what has been ordered to wash through the system.  Otherwise, it will be distorted.<\/p> <p> Changes were made on budget day by way of financial resolution that addressed certain stamp duty issues relating to share transactions.  Financial Resolution No. 5 and section 60 of this legislation impose a stamp duty charge where there is an agreement to acquire a target company and that target company enters into an arrangement whereby the shares in that company are cancelled.  Under previous provisions, this was a method to sidestep the 1% stamp duty charge.  While I am totally in agreement with the change made by the Minister, in the interest of tax certainty he should consider including a provision that would exclude transactions where shareholders have been notified of this transaction.<\/p> <p> Issues have also been raised about the rebate scheme announced for the haulage industry as a consequence of the increase in carbon tax.  It was announced on budget day that this scheme would compensate the industry for increases in the tax.  Section 41 outlines how the scheme will work.  There are concerns that the parameters put in place by the section still leave hauliers in a worse-off position.  We will tease it out on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of backdating the provisions to when carbon tax was increased on budget day.<\/p> <p> Almost 12 months ago, Fianna F&aacute;il decided to extend the confidence and supply arrangement to ensure there was no election in 2019.  The backdrop of that decision was the uncertainty and chaos that was evident in Westminster.  As we gather this evening to discuss budget 2020 in legislative form, that uncertainty persists and is equally relevant.  We still do not know what Brexit will materialise or when it will materialise.  As a party, we will engage constructively, as we have done on previous budgets, on Committee Stage with all Members to tackle the issues I have outlined and many others I have not had an opportunity to cover in a short Second Stage contribution.  We look forward to engaging with the Minister and all Members on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300055#MMM00200","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571851500,"counter":572,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo inniu sa Teach.

As I said then, and reiterate now, Brexit was always going to have an impact on the budget but it should not have defined it.  As I said then, Brexit did not set the parameters for the budget; those parameters were set by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  As we discuss the Bill in great detail in the Chamber and in the coming weeks on Committee Stage, we will have a greater opportunity to debate those choices the Government took.  The budget was an opportunity to give workers and families a break as they faced out-of-control rents, rip-off insurance premiums and unaffordable childcare costs but it did nothing to deal with any of those issues.  Instead, it hit households with the hike in carbon tax, a policy that will not change behaviours but will just make those families and households poor.  I will go through certain aspects of the Bill before offering greater scrutiny on Committee Stage.  There are some parts I would like to touch on but will not have an opportunity until Committee Stage, and the Minister knows I will go through each one of them thoroughly.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 was a bad day for workers and families but a great day for multinational executives because the Government chose in the Bill to extend SARP, a wee scheme that very few of the public know about but with which many of wealthy executives are all too familiar.  The scheme allows them to write off one third of their salary against income tax.  It means a multinational executive who moves to Dublin on a salary of &euro;1 million is able to dodge more than &euro;123,000 in tax, which anybody else would have to pay.  As people out there were wondering what they gained from the budget, and \"Prime Time\" put up slides showing that people gained little if anything and that they lost as a result of the carbon tax, up to 1,000 people were rubbing their hands with glee, popping the champagne corks and toasting the Minister because they will be &euro;123,000 better off next year as a result of a measure in the legislation that every member of Fianna F&aacute;il will endorse and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300057#OOO00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1571851500,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300057#OOO00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1571852100,"counter":574,"content":"<p>Let people hear that clearly.  This was not a budget that changed the fortunes of the many but did change the fortunes of the few who always have the ear of the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il and are always accommodated in legislation such as this.  Other workers will have to pay tax of 40% on their salary above the standard rate band while these multimillionaire executives will pay tax of 28% above the standard rate band.<\/p>  <p>  We do not even know the cost of this tax break but we can make some predictions.  In 2016, 793 people, 18 of whom were millionaires, used this tax break and it cost the State &euro;18 million.  In 2017, 1,084 people, 31 of whom were millionaires, used this tax break and it cost taxpayers &euro;28 million.  If that increase of 55% in the cost of the tax break between 2016 and 2017 is mirrored into 2018, 2019 and 2020, this tax break will cost the Irish people &euro;100 million next year.  At the same time, the Government is handing out only &euro;5 million for lone parents and &euro;18 million to increase medical card thresholds for the over 70s.  Those were the choices of the Government and, in other areas, it did nothing.  Despite the risk to the public finances posed by Brexit, the Government thought it appropriate to provide a tax break to executives, some of them millionaires, which could cost the State up to &euro;100 million annually.  <\/p>  <p>  Despite all of the expert advice on another measure, the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il have decided to press ahead with the help-to-buy scheme, extending it for another two years in section 15 of this Bill, at a cost of another &euro;100 million in 2020 alone.  That is &euro;40 million more than was allocated for additional social housing.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke in this Chamber last week and, speaking to the T&aacute;naiste, I raised the issue of Sam, a five year old child who was eating his dinner from a piece of cardboard on the streets in this city.  There are other children sitting outside the GPO and doing likewise because they are not allowed hot food in emergency accommodation.  Children are being provided with sleeping bags instead of emergency accommodation and a safe home.  I spoke about how the nation wants to reach out and comfort those children and there was an opportunity in this budget to do that.  This nation and State, particularly us in this House as the representatives and voices of the people, could do that by making the right choices but the only outstretched hand from this Government reached out to comfort multinational executives who are getting the tax breaks in this Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300058#PPP00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1571852100,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300058#PPP00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1571852100,"counter":576,"content":"<p>The Government has sold out the children of this nation who need a helping hand now.  The Minister has reintroduced this tax break by extending the scheme.  More than one fifth of houses that were bought through this scheme were bought at a cost of more than &euro;375,000.  Worse still, 40% of the people who availed of this tax break already had the 10% deposit that was needed to get the mortgage to buy the house.  That 40% equates to &euro;40 million that was handed out to people who did not need it to get the deposit to buy a house and yet Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il think that money is better spent in their pockets than it would have been spent in reaching out to people like Sam and many others who deserved a break in this budget.  This is not an affordable housing scheme no matter what way it is wrapped up.  The report by the Parliamentary Budget Office made it quite clear that it has done nothing to reduce house prices and has failed to help low and middle-income earners onto the property ladder.  This is the affordable housing strategy of the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, the party of home ownership for only the wealthiest in society.<\/p>  <p>  What has the Government done for the self-employed in the Finance Bill?  Quite simply, not enough.  The Government promised, in the programme for Government, to equalise the earned income tax credit and PAYE tax credit, bringing it to &euro;1,650 by 2018.  We will soon be entering 2020 and the self-employed are still waiting because it is only going to reach &euro;1,500, &euro;150 short of the amount promised to be delivered in 2018.  Sinn F&eacute;in has shown clearly that equalisation should have happened and the Government has still chosen not to do it.<\/p>  <p>  Section 64 of this Finance Bill provides an increase on the capital acquisitions tax, CAT, threshold from &euro;325,000 to &euro;335,000 at a cost of &euro;11 million.  That increase is unjustified and amounts to nothing more than a giveaway to the wealthiest in society.  For the average family, the new threshold is still set above the average house price in the State, which stands at approximately &euro;257,000.  If we are to be honest with ourselves and the people, this was a gift from the Government to the wealthiest households in Dublin.  Its sole policy outcomes will be to increase inequality, narrow the tax base and reduce available resources for our public services.<\/p>  <p>  I will come to some of the issues that I welcome in the Finance Bill.  We welcome the move in the Bill to heed Sinn F&eacute;in's calls to tackle the serious tax avoidance among property investors through REITs and IREFs.  The Minister will know that I have continually banged on about this issue in this House and have submitted parliamentary questions.  We have dealt with this matter in Finance Bills over a number of years and it has, unfortunately, fallen on deaf ears until this point.  I welcome the move on that, particularly the provisions of section 28 which seem to close the re-evaluation loophole that was present upon REIT cessation by requiring that the relevant REIT must be in operation for over 15 years before enjoying preferential treatment.  I would make the point that there should not be a CGT exemption even if a REIT was in operation after 15 years.  If these properties are sold to a company after that time, the REIT should still not avail of a CGT exemption.  <\/p>  <p>  For example, Green REIT has latent property gains of over &euro;100 million.  It seems that this move should restrict the ability of the recent buyer of Green REIT, Henderson Park, from utilising the tax exemption that existed before and the Minister will be well aware that I have raised this case in particular with him on a number of occasions, both on the floor of the D&aacute;il and through parliamentary questions.  However, I ask the Minister, as I have before without answer, if the recent sale of Green REIT to Henderson Park will be caught within the change of this tax legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Section 60 seems to close the tax loophole on stamp duty that has existed for investors for far too long.  This Government decision is based on its listening to Sinn F&eacute;in on this issue but, unfortunately, a bit too late.  The provisions of this Bill do not go far enough.  Property investors have for too long been allowed to aggressively invest in property and avoid serious tax.  They should be subject to the new 7.5% rate of commercial stamp duty just like everybody else.  If somebody buys a sweet shop in my parish in Gweedore, they have to pay 7.5% stamp duty.  When Henderson Park buys Green REIT, holding &euro;1.34 billion of commercial property, it will pay 1% stamp duty.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will be familiar with what we did in the Finance Bill in 2018.  At my instigation, we brought in an anti-tax avoidance measure where companies are able to sell shares at a rate of 1% but the anti-tax avoidance measure meant that gains derived from commercial property would be subject to a 6% rate.  The idea and interpretation of legislation that means Green REIT is exempt from that anti-tax avoidance measure makes no sense and goes against the spirit of what I argued and for which I got support from the Government in bringing in that measure.  That loophole should be closed in this Finance Bill.  The sale of commercial property worth &euro;1.34 billion under the control of Green REIT should be subject to stamp duty at the same rate as every other property that is sold in this State.<\/p>  <p>  I have run out of time for my contribution but there is much more that I want to raise.  I particularly want to make a point about the increased dividend withholding tax and Sinn F&eacute;in argued for its introduction in the first instance.  After a period of time, the Minister agreed to that at a rate of 20% and that was welcome.  Sinn F&eacute;in argued for that rate to be increased and, unfortunately, the Minister has not gone all the way to 33% but a move has been made, although we will argue it ought to go further.<\/p>  <p>  As for the research and development tax credit, Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued that there needs to be a research and development-light scheme, which the Government is now introducing, and for SMEs to have preferential treatment for research and development at a 30% rate.  I welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other aspects of the Finance Bill that I will not get to because my colleagues want to come in on this debate but we will go through this in detail on Committee Stage.  The closure of the loophole for Henderson Park, which will bring in millions of euro to this State, must be enacted in the Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300058#PPP00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1571852100,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill and to again offer a critique of the Government's budget, some of the measures included in it, and more importantly for Sinn F&eacute;in, some measures that should have been included and were not because the Government made the wrong choices and failed to give workers and families a break that they needed.<\/p> <p> I will begin with the increase in carbon tax.  In my speech on budget day, I made the point that the tax was unfair and regressive, that it would make many working families poorer and that the analysis before the budget from the Minister's Department, accepted by him, was that carbon tax was regressive and that those on the lowest incomes would have to pick up the tab and pay the price.  We have to win people over in order to reduce carbon emissions.  We have targets to meet, and the only way we will do so is by ensuring that people change their behaviour and reduce their carbon footprint, but there is also a responsibility for large corporations and polluters.  The point that the Minister has missed is that increasing carbon tax will not change people's behaviour.  It will make people poorer, and if they do not have alternatives that is all it will do, but it will not make the State any greener or cleaner, which is the fundamental flaw in his argument.<\/p> <p> In the Minister's closing remarks on budget day, after which there was not an opportunity for us to respond, he argued that those who opposed carbon tax were against taxes that change people's behaviour, but that is not the case.  As he knows, we supported the introduction of sugar tax and the plastic bag levy.  We did so because they work and because there is an alternative for people.  If one drinks Coke, there is also Coke Zero, or if one drinks Fanta, there is also Fanta Zero.  If there is an alternative, people have an opportunity to use it, and the same is true in the case of the plastic bag levy.  It is not the case, however, in respect of carbon tax because the vast majority of people, as the Minister will be aware, do not have the means to change from heating their home with oil and gas to doing so with alternatives.<\/p> <p> The vast majority of people cannot afford electric cars.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has indicated that the target in the Government's climate action plan of having 1 million electric cars on the road in the next ten years cannot be met.  Even if it is possible, people will not be able to afford them unless the price falls dramatically.  There are people living in rural Ireland who do not have access to public transport.  I live in a rural village through which no bus, of any description, passes.  People depend on their cars because they do not have an alternative.  If they did, we could consider increasing carbon tax to change their behaviour.  The way the Government chose to increase it, however, will do nothing more than increase revenue.  The Minister should not tell us the Government will ring-fence the money for proposals that will reduce people's carbon footprint or be good for climate change mitigation.  That can be done in any event, through progressive taxation and the other options the Government had, many of which we presented to him.<\/p> <p> Teachta Pearse Doherty spoke about the convoluted schemes in place for executives who can avoid paying income tax.  Moreover, banks make large sums of money and secure corporation tax exemptions, and the bank levy is not what it should be.  That is because Fine Gael represents a cosseted, privileged class.  I stated that on budget day and I firmly believe it.  If it was interested in the plight of ordinary working people and had even the remotest understanding of what many families throughout the State go through weekly, it would have presented a different budget.  The homeless people to whom Teachta Pearse Doherty referred, and the child seen eating food from cardboard, are not the only ones in such circumstances.  There are families who no longer rent homes but rooms, and there are landlords who no longer let houses but rooms in houses.  Some people, including families, pay &euro;800 or &euro;900 per month to rent a room in the capital city.  That is the reality for many families but I do not believe that the Minister grasps that.  There was zilch in the budget for them.  The Government did nothing for families who need a home.  <\/p> <p> The health service is an issue that needed significant attention.  I have on numerous occasions raised the lack of capacity at University Hospital Waterford.  There are pressures at University Hospital Galway, University Hospital Limerick and in acute hospitals throughout the State.  Record numbers of people lie on trolleys.  It is not that Sinn F&eacute;in or anybody else is making up what I have outlined.  The Government knows about it and the figures speak for themselves.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, releases the figures monthly and they show record numbers of people lying on hospital trolleys but the budget did little to mitigate that.<\/p> <p> It was the same last year.  There was another stand-still budget, although it may have been worse, with less money going into the health service in real terms, when increased demand, demographics and so on were taken into account.  The same will happen this year.  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies will waltz into the Chamber, and Fine Gael Deputies will probably do likewise, crying crocodile tears about the record numbers of people on hospital trolleys or without a home.  The time to deal with such issues is on budget day, when the Minister should put his money where his mouth is, tax those who can afford to pay a bit more, raise the necessary revenue and provide for citizens, but that is not what he did.  As the Government always does, it pretended there was no alternative.<\/p> <p> We proposed an emergency freeze on rents for three years, and Berlin introduced a five-year freeze yesterday.  The Government turned its back on the proposal, however, because it does not believe in helping tenants, although it certainly believes in supporting landlords.  We sought a refundable tax credit of one month's rent, with a limit, to help tenants but the Government said \"No\".  We sought a package of measures to reduce the cost of childcare but the Government said \"No\".  We sought the provision of two free GP visits for every citizen in the State, to enable us to get to the point Sl&aacute;intecare promised, but the Government said \"No\".  It has committed to Sl&aacute;intecare in theory but in practice and delivery, it is nowhere to be seen.  The stand-out unfair announcement in the budget, which the Economic and Social Research Institute called a deeply regressive budget, was the increase in carbon tax.  It did not take all the other steps that would have given workers and families a break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102300058#PPP00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571852700,"counter":579,"content":"<p>The income tax section of the Finance Bill, and in the explanatory memorandum, has to be one of the shortest I have seen in any budget.  In most years, some attempt is made to index tax bands and allowances to the level of the expected wage increase in the next year.  While I accept that the Minister had to act with some caution in respect to Brexit and to give it significant consideration, it is nonetheless astonishing.  As the Minister has noted on many occasions, including perhaps on budget day, he expects low income increases for most workers, at approximately 3% on average or, in some cases, up to 4.5%.  The failure to index tax bands in any way means that for the majority of ordinary workers, the budget is highly regressive.  Given the Government's previous commitment to developing greater equality in Irish society, the conscious decision to opt for a regressive budget at a time of a threatening Brexit is wrong.  The budget could have made proper provision for Brexit but it need not have penalised ordinary workers at the lower levels of income in the way it did.  The only increases, welcome and all as they are, were in the home carer credit, from &euro;1,500 to &euro;1,600, or an increase of &euro;100, while section 4 provides for an increase in the earned income credit for self-employed people from &euro;1,350 to &euro;1,500, or an increase of &euro;150.
