The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask members and all others in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending the meeting physically and to use the sanitisers provided.  They should maintain an appropriate level of social distance and masks should be worn at all times, except when speaking.  I ask people to co-operate with these measures.<\/p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  This morning, we engage with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine: the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 32 - Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 6 re Covid-19 restart grant schemes.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment: Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General; Ms Pauline Mulligan, head of corporate services division; Mr. Declan Hughes, head of indigenous enterprise, SME and entrepreneurship division; and Mr. Cathal O'Gorman, finance officer.  From the Department of Public expenditure and Reform, we are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Georgina Hughes-Elders, principal officer, and Ms Jessica Lawless, assistant principal, from the Department the of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote section.  They are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Vice Chairman to ensure the privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if the statements of a witness are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, that witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that such a direction is complied with.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions under Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.<\/p><p> I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. S&eacute;amus McCarthy, to make his opening statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#A00600","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637227800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 32 Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicates gross expenditure of &euro;1.76 billion was incurred in 2020.  This represented an increase of 89% over the 2019 level of expenditure, due mainly to the provision of funding for Covid-19 related schemes.  In a number of expenditure areas, the level of funding provided for Covid-19 related spending was significantly more than was actually required in the year.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 spending was distributed across three expenditure programmes of varying size.  The largest expenditure programme was in jobs and enterprise development.  This accounted for &euro;1.3 billion, or 72% of the total spent in 2020.  Key areas of spending under the programme included &euro;652 million for Covid-19 related business restart grant schemes which was routed through Enterprise Ireland; &euro;192 million in other funding for Enterprise Ireland including its normal programmes; &euro;198 million provided to the IDA; &euro;79 million for local enterprise development; &euro;48 million transferred to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and just under &euro;25 million transferred to Microfinance Ireland, to fund various business loan schemes. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the innovation programme in 2020 was &euro;414 million, which was similar to the level of spending in 2019.  This included spending of &euro;332 million on the science and technology development programme; &euro;24 million on the programme for research in third level institutions; &euro;24 million on subscriptions to international organisations; and &euro;19 million for the &lsquo;disruptive technologies&rsquo; fund.  Expenditure on the business regulation programme was &euro;77 million in 2020, again, similar to the 2019 expenditure level.  This funding supported the direct operation by the Department of certain regulatory functions including the Workplace Relations Commission, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Companies Registration Office and the Patents Office.  Funding was also provided from the programme for independent bodies, such as the Health and Safety Authority, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p> <p>  Receipts into the vote amounted to just under &euro;50 million in 2020.  These substantially relate to fees for services operated by the Department, including employment permit fees in respect of foreign workers; Companies Registration Office filing fees; and trade mark and patent fees.  Receipts also include retained staff pension contributions, both from the Department&rsquo;s own staff, and the staff of agencies under its aegis.  The surplus remaining unspent at the year-end was just over &euro;182 million.  The Department secured the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;106 million in unspent capital funding to 2021.  The balance of &euro;76 million was due for surrender to the Central Fund of the Exchequer. The appropriation account records the cash transactions related to the vote in the year of account.  In addition the vote has incurred a contingent liability arising from the operation of a number of credit guarantee schemes.  This is explained in note 2.9 to the account which indicates that, at 31 December 2020, the Department&rsquo;s maximal exposure under the guarantee schemes was &euro;80 million on outstanding loans totalling &euro;113 million.  This was up from a maximum exposure of &euro;5 million at the end of 2019 on outstanding loans of &euro;30 million. <\/p> <p>  As outlined in chapter 6, small to medium businesses received grants from Vote 32 totalling around &euro;633 million in respect of interruptions to trading as a result of Covid-19 related restrictions in 2020.  The schemes were operated and funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with the payments being made by the relevant local authorities. The funding was routed to the local authorities via Enterprise Ireland.  The purpose of the grant was to assist businesses with costs arising from the restrictions.  Under the scheme provisions, businesses were invited to self-declare their eligibility.  Conditions of the grant included that the business was a commercial enterprise operating from a premises liable to local authority commercial rates; had incurred, or expected to incur, a 25% or more loss of turnover between April and June 2020; intended to retain staff on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and committed to remain open for trading or to reopen.  Businesses were not required to explain how the money was to be used, and vouching for the manner in which the grants were applied was not required.  <\/p> <p>  A grant scheme that relies on self-declaration should have a number of key controls.  One of these is the completion of post-payment checks to ensure that claimants had satisfied the conditions of the scheme and were accordingly entitled to the payments they received.  The conditions of the scheme were such that a significant number of businesses were likely to qualify for the financial assistance available.  Nevertheless there is a risk that claims were submitted and paid where the prescribed conditions were not met.  The Department signalled at the outset of the scheme that reviews of eligibility for the grants would be undertaken, but these have not yet occurred.  As a result, there is no basis of assurance about entitlement of grant recipients to the amounts paid.  At the time of completing this report the Department was in the process of procuring an independent audit of the scheme.  Subsequently, the Department plans to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1637227800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I understand this is the first appearance of Dr. Quinn as Accounting Officer before the committee so I take the opportunity to particularly welcome her and wish her every success in her brief.

I am pleased to be here before the committee this morning.  The Chair has introduced my team and her thank her for that.<\/p> <p>  As members know 2020 was a year like no other and Covid-19 had an immediate impact on the Department, on the economy and on our citizens, while dealing with Brexit at the same time.  Our budget, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, increased hugely to &euro;1.95 billion which was double our allocation of &euro;977 million in 2019.  This allowed us to roll out significant and targeted supports for enterprise, including the restart and the restart plus grants, the sustaining enterprise fund, the Covid products scheme and the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  It also allowed us to significantly expand other supports such as the working capital and future growth loan schemes and the Microfinance Ireland Covid loans scheme.  In addition we responded with a large number of non-fiscal measures in areas of company regulation, health and safety, workplace relations as well as new advisory supports.  One of the most significant measures was the restart grant scheme.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his report, grants to the value of &euro;640 million were paid to enterprises of which &euro;633 million was paid out by ourselves and &euro;7 million by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The local authorities were used to specifically and quickly get that money out to businesses and we provided those businesses impacted by the pandemic with modest amounts of cash.  The aim was to meet the additional costs that all firms incurred due to Covid-19 and to preserve, in particular, economic activity in our country.  It was delivered in conjunction with other Government supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment.  <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report makes two specific recommendations on auditing and evaluation.  The Department accepts both recommendations and is committed to implementing them.  I should emphasise that any consideration of the oversight of the restart schemes must have due regard to the circumstances in which those schemes were designed and launched, and in particular the need to have them available as urgently as possible.  I am very pleased that those schemes, after a Government decision in early May, relaunched on 22 May, which took huge effort by the officials of the Department, and others.<\/p><p>Apart from the restart schemes, we also rolled out other measures.  Some &euro;98 million was allocated for the sustaining enterprise fund, which assisted 340 businesses to stay in business and contribute to the recovery of our economy.  The online retail scheme was hugely successful.  The business planning voucher, the enterprise centres and the Brexit ready for customs grant were all very important.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland had an overall net loss of 872 jobs but created 16,500 new jobs, with 65% of those jobs based regionally.  IDA Ireland also got specific grant aid for Covid.  That scheme has considerable potential for us into the future.  Notwithstanding the pandemic, IDA Ireland continues to win new investments, with 246 new investments secured last year and 20,000 new jobs.  I am pleased that half of those went to regional locations, which is one of our policy aims.<\/p><p> The local enterprise offices were very important.  We increased their funding by 170% last year.  The business continuity voucher scheme supported more than 12,000 businesses at a cost of &euro;20 million.  The trading online voucher scheme would, in the recent past, have involved 1,000 vouchers annually.  Last year, vouchers were sent to 13,000 recipients to allow companies to go online.  That was hugely successful for small businesses.  I am delighted to report that employment in that regard totalled 35,000 at local level.<\/p><p> We also responded significantly in terms of liquidity to business, which was a considerable factor, particularly at the time when banks were not lending.  We provided almost &euro;50 million for the Covid and Brexit working capital loan schemes and the future growth loan scheme.  Those schemes included 3,000 loans to businesses, worth &euro;548 million.<\/p><p> Probably the most significant was the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  In the first four months it was open, 1,890 loans were given out to a value of &euro;98 million.  The scheme has continued to grow strongly.  We are now at almost 8,000 loans with a value of just over &euro;550 million.<\/p><p> Microfinance Ireland was key.  It was the first agency to market with a Covid loan fund in March 2020 and 1,300 firms availed of it.  That involved a six-month interest and repayment holiday, as well as reduced interest.  It supported 3,000 jobs.<\/p><p> We also looked to innovation.  I will later touch on the disruptive technology fund, which funded 43 innovative projects.  We see that as the future for Ireland.<\/p><p> Apart from direct financial supports, we established a call centre and provided guides for business and a whole range of communications material.  Legislation was to the fore.  We changed company law and employment rights.  We recently introduced a new examinership-lite process, the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, to assist our small and micro companies.<\/p><p> The Health and Safety Authority is important. It is at the forefront of workplace safety.  It developed the Return to Work Safely Protocol and has revised it several times since.  We are working on it now.  It also took on a new role as the lead agency in co-ordinating compliance right across Government.  All of our agencies and bodies, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Companies Registration Office and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement played vital roles.  They adapted their services.  They were agile and flexible.  They responded, postponed regulatory requirements and provided advice.  <\/p><p> While the challenges of Covid remain, the reopening of our economy and the return to the workplace has allowed our businesses to get back trading and to remain in business.  Unemployment has fallen from a high of 31.5% in April 2020 to 7.9%.  We are not where we were before the pandemic but we certainly feel that our supports have been key to achieving this progress.<\/p><p> I note that, with the exception of &euro;6 million provided to the Department at the end of 2020, all of the additional funding was expended solely on business supports.  There were no additional administrative or staffing resources incurred in the Department.  These schemes were developed and delivered under enormous pressure by staff in the Department with our offices and agencies.  The combined efforts were such that we were able to deliver in a timely and efficient manner.  I must put on my record my thanks for the commitment and dedication of those teams.  I am happy to take any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637227800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Quinn.

She has outlined a couple of the key points around the gross expenditure of the Department and its growth in 2020 in comparison to 2019 as the Department reacted to the situation around Covid-19.  Looking at the restart grant, there seems to be quite a number of concerns around the whole process to test eligibility and the effectiveness of its implementation.  That has caused some concern.  The restart grant was important for many businesses and provided them with the financial support they required to reopen.  One could argue that many businesses which felt outside the criteria for that support needed it while others which may not have needed it received the support.  I will ask a couple of questions about the restart grant.  How did it come about in terms of the Department's operations?  How did the notion of providing this type of support arise on day one?  Could Dr. Quinn outline that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#C00300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637227800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I absolutely will.  It arose as a result of many of the meetings we had with stakeholders at that time.  Our advice to Government was that companies were really struggling.  They were struggling to provide the type of Covid equipment that would allow them to remain open.  They were struggling with their banks.  They were struggling with their cash flow because many of them had closed due to Government restrictions.  There was an immediate need to cover fixed costs and the cost of opening, reopening and adapting their businesses.  One of the conditions we were very keen on and that was built into the scheme was that companies would maintain employment.  That was an important factor.  We did not want to wipe out a whole range of small companies.  There are approximately 250,000 small companies in Ireland.  Very many of those are sole traders so they did not come into that scheme.  We were intent on trying to maintain employees in their jobs.

Under the criteria, companies had to be rate payers to qualify.  They had to have a turnover of less than &euro;5 million.  We were aiming this at small businesses and, in the first round, it was for companies with 50 or fewer employees.  It was aimed at the small business sector.  We expanded that in the second round, the restart plus grant.  Eligibility was expanded to include companies with 250 employees because we picked up from our feedback that companies were struggling.  We expanded the scheme to cater for that.  It was based on self-declaration and we made it simple.  We are quite satisfied that the companies which applied were eligible under the criteria we were maintaining.  A huge number of people are listed as small businesses but work in the construction sector or are sole traders.

Approximately two months after its introduction, the scheme was replaced by the restart grant plus scheme.  In terms of that process, why did it negate the requirement to complete a review from the Department's point of view?  Dr. Quinn outlined that there were some teething problems and issues.  She referred to tourism.  I was going to use that example because there were many non-rate paying businesses there which were excluded that perhaps should have been given that support.  In my view, their exclusion was a great shame.  Many businesses fell by the wayside as a consequence.  On the fact that the Department stated that the process negated the requirement to complete a review, would Dr. Quinn mind outlining to us why that happened?

From our perspective, we reviewed on a weekly basis.  We sat down and looked at who was gaining and who was not, and that allowed us to adapt the scheme, as the Deputy pointed out, for other cohorts very quickly.  In the normal course of events, it would take us more than a year to design and roll out a scheme like this.  We did it in a matter of weeks.  I am quite satisfied that the review kept control of the numbers and that we were plugging gaps.<\/p> <p>  I would also mention again that we adapted it on a number of occasions for various counties that went into lockdown, such as Laois, Offaly and Kildare.

There is an opportunity here for the Department to look at the geographical breakdown in terms of the different local authorities' administrative areas and examine the ability to work with areas where the Department feels that there are teething problems that we need to be dealt with.  If we are going to be dealing with a situation - I hope it does not happen, but it would be prudent for us to plan in this direction - whereby businesses may be forced to close again because of Covid restrictions, then I am of the view that this should be the subject of close scrutiny and analysis by the Department.  Depending on where a business is located, and in the context of the remits of certain Departments, it is not fair that it would not be given the same level of support that colleagues in other local authority areas would be when money is being drawn down from the national schemes.  I am not having a dig at my own local authority - to be fair to Cork County Council, it has been excellent to deal with - but this matter has been raised to me by other elected representatives from across the country.  It can be seen from the data and the analysis that are available to us, as public representatives.

We rely heavily on colleagues in other Departments and in the industry sector who head up those plans to keep us in the loop on them.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, from our perspective, we keep this matter under review.

Many areas in the Cork East constituency, which I represent, and in other parts of the country that are outside of the greater Dublin area suffer from high unemployment and do not have sources of local employment.  I refer to the town of Youghal, from which I originally come.  Deputy Sherlock is beside me, and Mallow is in a similar situation, as are Fermoy and other towns in our constituency.

IDA Ireland has been successful in regional balance in recent years.  I mentioned that more than 50% of all jobs are now outside of Dublin.  I will mention a number of features.  First, IDA Ireland runs the regional action plan.  That takes a regional approach and is led by businesspeople in the regions, which gives us a good oversight role.  Enterprise Ireland's latest figure is that more than 60% of new jobs are being created outside Dublin.<\/p> <p>  We do not tend to think about a particular area, for example, Youghal, which the Deputy mentioned.  We tend to think of it as a region because there are opportunities for people to commute and travel.  We focus strongly on the region and to the forefront of our policy and aim is to have regional balance.  I should say, particularly from the IDA Ireland side, that companies coming into Ireland make their own decisions.  Quite often, they want to be beside an airport, water source or other feature, depending on their needs.  We cannot control that but we encourage them by providing regional sites.  IDA Ireland purchases advanced sites.  We have advanced manufacturing coming up in Limerick and we try to work that closely on a regional basis which provides a basis for companies to come in, create employment and take up opportunities in other areas outside Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1637227800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming the Secretary General and her officials.

They are important questions for us to be able to stand over, not least in case, though hopefully not, of future schemes of this nature.

The point we make is that when we send money into the European Space Agency, the companies get contracts to the value of what we invest, so it is a very important approach for us.  More recently, we saw &euro;13 million won by them.<\/p> <p>  The number of companies has grown by 60% in the past five years.  It is small.  It is up from the 55 companies we had in 2015 and it is now at 87, but they are key, niche companies.  The important part about them is that because they engage across with the IDA sector as well, quite often there can be partnerships and other areas we can then exploit for Ireland to be at the leading global edge on innovation.<\/p> <p>  For us, where we have additional funding, we have put it in there.  In 2020, for example, three Irish companies were selected by the European Space Agency to develop solutions on satellite and satellite systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1637227800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Excuse me, did I miss the figure of how much we have contributed to the European Space Agency?

In Covid, the HSA initially started off with a relatively small staff and we needed to expand the inspectorate for Covid.  The HSA took on the lead role in co-ordinating other resources.  We now have inspectorates working collectively from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Education and any of the Government agencies that have an inspectorate.  The environmental health officer is very important.  In total, there are about 700 inspectors now working on the protocol as part of their normal inspection duties.<\/p> <p>  For the HSA, more than 15,000 investigations and inspections were carried out but, overall, there were in the region of 50,000 inspections of Covid compliance.

It is just to have an overview and an understanding of it.  Another issue, which probably is not to do with the accounts, relates to page 23 of the Department's Covid-19 and Brexit planning document, specifically the permits section of the Department and delivering employment permits.  I understand the Department concentrated on the health sector, which I very much appreciate, and any interaction I had with the Department in regard to that sector was brilliant and immediately taken care of.  However there are other sectors, such as the road transport sector, which has been applying for an employment permit for four stipulated countries and I am told the process has taken between six and nine months.  There is the added difficulty whereby the Department must correspond with the Department of Transport in regard to the driving licence, but Dr. Quinn will have heard and noted, particularly of late, that there is an even further difficulty and crisis within that sector.<\/p> <p>  Will Dr. Quinn outline for me how she correlates with the Department of Transport to try to speed up the process?  I note the Minister of State, Deputy English, said the quota requirement has been removed.

However, the hours cannot be delivered so, essentially, the funding will never be used.  I hope Mr. Hughes understands me.

In the healthcare sector, for example, we have a difficulty in the nursing home care area.  Have there been discussions with the Department of Health in dealing with that?

In the private nursing homes, there are about 23,000 residents, so a fairly substantial number of staff are needed.<\/p><p>Quite a number of people who worked in the area have retired for very genuine reasons.

Five items of correspondence have been flagged in this category.<\/p> <p>  I will move to consider correspondence from Accounting Officers, Ministers, or both, and relating to follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No. 872B was received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 5 November 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from the fact that the Revenue did not accept certain recommendations in the committee's most recent report on its engagement with Revenue.  The committee asked Revenue to clarify to what extent it can investigate the financial and sectoral implications of a voluntary PAYE system agreed by Revenue and courier firms in March 1997, as well as a copy of the 2019 European Commission inspection report on the control strategy for customs values and repayments.  I have flagged this item for discussion, as have Deputies Carthy and Stanley.  I suggest we hold it over until next week as I know it is of interest to Deputy Stanley.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 873B is correspondence from Ms Marie-Claire Maney, chairperson of the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 8 November 2021.  It responds to the committee's request for information relating to tax settlements between the Revenue Commissioners and Perrigo.  The chairperson states that due to its statutory obligations around the confidentiality of appellants, rather than any reluctance to respond to oversight, the commission cannot provide such information.  The chairperson goes on to detail the relevant statutory provisions, stating that if a settlement is agreed at any stage before the commission makes a determination, the appeal is treated as having been withdrawn and the parties need only notify the commission of the settlement.  As such, the commission has no role in the tax settlement agreed between Perrigo and the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  The chairperson also provides an update on the current status of the top ten appeals by quantum.  The most recent update was provided for our meeting with the commission on 8 July.  It is worth noting that the aggregate quantum of tax under appeal has reduced from &euro;4.5 billion in January 2021 to &euro;1.55 billion on 8 November 2021.  We have also requested detailed information from Revenue relating to this settlement, which is due today.  It is proposed to note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Carthy and I have flagged it.<\/p> <p>  No. 974B is correspondence from Ms Cliodhna Guy, interim chief executive officer of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, dated 8 November 2021.  It provides further information requested by the committee about the installation of CCTV cameras at racecourses.<\/p><p>The interim CEO states that it has concluded the evaluation of the tenders for the installation of CCTV systems in racecourse stable yards, and that the board continues to work to the previously stated timeframe for installation to be completed at each racecourse prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  The interim CEO also notes that the cost of the system is considerably higher than what had been allocated by Horse Racing Ireland previously and on that basis the matter is currently with the Horse Racing Ireland board for approval.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Deputy Imelda Munster and I flagged this item, but I do not think she is present.  It would be useful to get a breakdown of the cost of the new system to include the installation costs and an update pack when the sanction to the purchase is granted.  I presume it will do that, but it would be no harm for us to request it.<\/p><p> No. 875B is correspondence from Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 8 November 2021 in which he provides information on updated arrangements for public bodies presenting their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, following their audit, the arrangements for laying them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It arises from a 2018 report of the last Committee of Public Accounts, which highlighted the inconsistency in the obligations of when public bodies must present their financial accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.<\/p><p> The new arrangements, as set out in Circular 24 of 2021, require that, unless otherwise specified in legislation, annual accounts should be presented to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit no later than three months after the close of the financial year.  As the accounts are laid before the Houses and brought to the attention of this committee by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the circular also removes the need for audited bodies to arrange for copies of audited accounts to be submitted to the committee.  This requirement was not being complied with in the majority of cases in any event.  In most cases, once the Comptroller and Auditor General has certified accounts, the accounts must be laid before the Houses within three months.  Members will be aware that this committee has a standing agreement to write to any bodies that are late in laying their audited accounts before the Houses.  However, this circular, as was the case with the one it replaces, includes a requirement, at paragraph 9, that the clerk to this committee be notified where there is an unavoidable delay beyond these time limits.  In practice, this is not being done.  If it were, it would remove the need for us to write to bodies to request explanations for late laying of accounts.<\/p><p> It is proposed to note and publish the item, to thank the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for providing the updated circular and to request that it remind Departments of the requirement to inform the clerk if statutory accounts are being presented later than the specified time limits and to explain the delay.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I hope our consistent following up where accounts were late had a role in putting that onto a more formal footing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#S00600","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637227800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>It is very welcome that the Department has taken the effort to refresh the instructions to Departments to remove certain anomalies and so on.

It is proposed to provide Nursing Homes Ireland with the updates the committee has received in respect of the implementation of its recommendations and to advise that the Department of Health will appear before the committee on 16 December.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Deputy Munster flagged an item of correspondence.  We could hold it over.  That is probably the fairest thing to do, so she has an opportunity to address it.  If we can move on to the work programme, it is agreed until the end of the year.  We previously agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November.  It is suggested that we do so next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Does any member wish to raise anything in respect of the work plan?  We will be coming back to it next week anyway.  Is there any other business?  I take it there is not.  We will briefly go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 25 November, when we will engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#T01200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637227800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 2.52 p.m. and adjourned at 2.53 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 November 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach","time":1637193600,"counter":292},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Roghchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 10:30<\/p><p>The Select Committee met at 10:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Dara Calleary,* Pearse Doherty, Paschal Donohoe (Minister for Finance), Francis Noel Duffy,* Mair\u00e9ad Farrell, Neale Richmond.<\/p><p>* In \u00e9agmais \/ In the absence of Deputies John McGuinness and Steven Matthews, respectively.<\/p><p>Teachta \/ Deputy Bernard J.

Amendment 158 introduces section 653AM to deal with situations where nobody has come forward as the owner of a site that is within the scope of this tax.  This measure provides that where the owner of such a site does not register with Revenue the site may become the property of the State.  If an owner has registered with Revenue, Revenue will use its normal collection mechanisms to collect the tax and interest due.  This provision only applies where no owner has been identified.  It will only apply where the tax and interest owing and charged on the land exceeds 110% of the market value of the site.  Once the amount of unpaid tax and interest exceeds 110% of the market value, the first step is that Revenue will place a notice in<i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>setting out that this process is commencing.  After six months, if nobody has come forward and registered as the owner of the land, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can make an application to the High Court to have the site concerned made property of the State.  The High Court can then make such directions as it thinks are appropriate in relation to publication or otherwise before making the order sought.  While it is envisaged that the Revenue Commissioners will rely on this measure only in limited circumstances, its inclusion is an important tool in targeting non-compliance in circumstances where the tax due on a site within the scope of residential zoned land tax is not paid and the landowner is not forthcoming in meeting its obligations. <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 131 and 133 place two additional requirements on owners of a site where they are making a submission to the local authority on either a draft map or a supplemental map.  These two additional requirements are, first, that the owner's submission includes a map from Ordinance Survey Ireland that clearly identifies the site and, second, the owner may be asked to provide evidence of ownership to the local authority.  Both of these additional requirements are necessary to ensure that the appeals procedure, where a landowner can appeal a decision of the local authority, can operate as intended. <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 160 and 161 seek to provide for reports in regard to the RZLT.  On amendment No. 160, the Deputies may note that in setting the initial rate for this tax great care needs to be taken to get the balance right between it achieving its essential purpose of encouraging the release of land for home building purposes, but at the same time not being too penal that it runs the risk of being challenged in the courts.  If I were to apply a rate of 25% from the outset, it would change significantly the economics of making a return on capital invested in the land as a business asset and this could make the business model unviable, which would be counterproductive and damaging to the goal of meeting our house building objectives over the next number of years.  It is important to see how the tax operates and to then make an assessment as to whether it is working.  If it is not leading to an increase in land being released for housing purposes, I will have no hesitation in reviewing the rate, if I deem it likely that this will help the situation.  In summary, I believe the 3% rate is an appropriate rate to apply when this tax comes into force in two years' time, as I am of the view it will encourage landowners to either develop their land or sell it to others for development purposes.  In doing this, the supply of land available will increase.  This should be reflected in a stabilisation of land prices.  It is for this purpose, I cannot agree to the amendment seeking this report.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 161 and the Deputies' wish that I produce a report estimating the likely financial impact of the exclusions, exemptions, deferrals and abatements from the residential zoned land tax contained in this section with a view to removing any or all of them before the tax comes into effect my views are as follows.  In order for this tax to be effective it is necessary that there be exclusions, including, among other things, residential dwellings and their gardens, certain infrastructure or facilities including utilities, transport, and facilitates for social, community or recreational purposes, business premises in areas zoned for mixed use purposes.  Without these exclusions, we would be taxing land on which there was no possibility of any housing development taking place.  This would make no sense.<\/p><p>In regard to the issue of deferrals, the Deputies should note that these arise only in very specific circumstances such as, first, where a judicial review has been sought by a third party against the decision of a local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to a planning decision.  In my view a deferral is fair in such a situation as the matter is out of the control of the developer.  The second circumstance is in a situation where a person has commenced development of a site.  Since the purpose of the tax is to encourage developers to build on this land, it seems appropriate in my view to suspend the payment of the tax, which continues to accrue, for the duration of the construction period.  Should they meet their delivery commitments, then the tax will not be payable, but failure to do so will result in a proportional payment of the suspended tax for the part not completed.  This approach is aligned with the philosophy behind this tax of encouraging the construction of houses rather than as a revenue raising measure.  For that reason, I cannot agree to this amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#A00600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Minister but we are experiencing some feedback on the system and it is affecting the broadcast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#A00700","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>It may be that somebody's device is not on mute.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#A00800","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I think the interference is gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The remaining amendments are all technical in nature, correcting references and typos and making other minor errors where the legislation, as drafted, did not quite work from a technical perspective.<\/p> <p>  I will be introducing a number of Report Stage amendments which I think at this stage will mainly relate to maps and are likely to be technical in nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>This section in the Finance Bill is larger than many Bills we deal with.

I do not imagine it will take very long.<\/p> <p>  My first question is on the rate.  I heard what the Minister said about keeping the rate under review if it was required.  We know the problems with the vacant site levy and we argued with the Government that it should come under the fold of the Revenue.  Notwithstanding that, my question is as follows.  Under the vacant site levy at 7%, the owner of a piece of land that is currently valued at &euro;1 million is currently required to pay &euro;70,000 annually.  Under the provisions of this section of the Bill, that will no longer be the case.  How much will the owner now pay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>If it is worth &euro;1 million, the owner will be paying &euro;30,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>That site is currently being charged &euro;70,000 to try to encourage its development or sale for development purposes and yet there is a reduction here.  That is the concern.  The vacant site levy was raised from 3% to 7%.  There are many more issues with the vacant site levy regarding collection, implementation, local authorities and all that.  The rate was also raised because at 3% on a piece of land worth &euro;1 million, the &euro;30,000 that was being charged was not working and so it was increased to &euro;70,000.  Given the lead-in time for this tax, surely it should be considered at a higher rate.  My view is that it is not penal to have it at a 7% rate because others, including some in Government parties, have called for the vacant site levy to be significantly increased.  There is a very long lead-in period meaning that people who have vacant sites will know that this is coming down the line within a number of years, giving them the opportunity to act.<\/p> <p>  With that in mind, why does the Minister believe reducing the tax required to be paid on those sites will encourage the owners to develop them, given that they will be paying less than half of what they are currently paying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>It is because of the difference in scale of the tax.

My recollection is that it applies to several hundred properties.  Our estimate is that the zoned land tax will cover approximately 8,000 ha to 9,000 ha.  Therefore, it will be 16 to 18 times bigger than the current tax.  Whereas the current vacant site levy is one with which very few landowners interface, the residential zoned land tax will become a core part of how land is taxed if homes are not being built on it.

If landowners do not develop, and if there is residential land in our towns and cities that is undeveloped, then they should pay 10% over three years.  They should probably be paying 10% in the first year.  We are in the middle of an emergency.  This is not the time to be thinking about the poor craturs who are hoarding land in the middle of our towns and cities.  This is a time to say, \"Use it or we penalise you because you have had enough time.\"  We have been in the middle of a housing emergency for a while.<\/p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will respond to that but let me put my other questions in the interests of time.  They are just technical questions.  Chapter 2 concerns zoned serviced residential land and applies to land \"solely or primarily for residential use, or \"for a mixture of uses, including residential use\".  We will have a situation where active farm land, which has a mixed-use purpose, will also be zoned for residential use because part of the farm is close to the town centre.  How does that work?  Is it the case that farmers will have to apply for it to be dezoned and so on?  Has there been consideration of the implications of how that will impact on agriculture?  If farmers are going to go and get land dezoned to solely agricultural land, is there is a process in place for them?  Are there any knock-on impacts on farmers being able to raise loans and so on and so forth in terms of land that will be devalued, even though they are using it for farming?<\/p> <p>  What happens to land subject to this tax, that is in scope and part of the final map, which is sold during the process, since the tax kicks in after a period?  How will the reasonable test outlined under the proposed section 653B(b), which is that the land is serviced or has access to services, operate?  My final question on this chapter is about Revenue's ability to engage.  I do not have the section in front of me but I am sure the Minister's officials will know it.  Revenue has the ability to point out to a local authority a site that was not included in earlier maps.  The local authority then has to make that provision in its final map.  That is fine if it is the middle of this process, which is that the local authority draws up a draft map, it goes to consultation and landowners are able to write in and make submissions or whatever.  For the subsequent map, Revenue, in the middle of that process, can point out a site that was omitted and, therefore, the local authority has to include it in the final map.  What if that omission is identified after the final map is published?  If I am correct, local authorities have to publish their new maps every five years.  Can those be captured within the five-year period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#C01600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I will deal with each question in turn.  In the case of the agricultural use of land zoned for residential purposes, the options will be to pay the tax, build homes on the land or change its zoning status.  One of the key reasons we need a run-in period for this is that a dezoning or rezoning process will be put in place by local authorities to allow, for example, a farmer actively farming land zoned for residential use to apply to change the zoning status of that land.

We are looking for a report on the vacant property tax.  The Government's Housing for All plan kicks the can down the road for another year on vacant property tax.  At the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in September, Department of Finance officials cited analysis by GeoDirectory which showed that in quarter 2 of 2021, there was 92,000 vacant properties.  Some 4.5% of homes lay vacant in June of this year.  Research shows we have the tenth highest vacancy rate in the world, which is a national scandal.  Dereliction and allowing properties to lie empty is an act of vandalism against the public good.  It can be seen in this city where apartments lie empty and in other areas where there is significant pressure in terms of housing need.<\/p> <p>  We were calling for a vacant property tax in 2016, as another lever that could be introduced to end the scourge of dereliction.  It has not been brought forward by the Government.  In 2017, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, argued for it in the context of that year's budget.  That was four years ago.  The Housing for All plan was published in September 2021, without any firm commitment to introducing a vacant property tax to penalise those who would allow residential properties to remain idle and unused.  It has committed to a data collection exercise.<\/p> <p>  The Minister and the committee will be familiar with my raising the issue of the need for a local property tax on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in 2018.  In response, the Minister cited the Indecon report from September 2018 arguing against its introduction.  Can the Minister now confirm he rejects the conclusions of that report?  Can he now confirm he does support the introduction of a vacant property tax?  Can he explain to the committee why he has not decided to introduce a vacant property tax in each of the past five years in which we have been calling for him to commit to one?  I ask the Minister to expedite the introduction of the vacant property tax without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#F03600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 162 and 164 would require the Minister for Finance to lay a report before the D&aacute;il on the introduction of a vacant residential property tax.  Amendment No. 162 would require that such a report be laid before the Houses within one month of the enactment of the Finance Bill, while Deputy Doherty seeks a report within six months of the passing of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I have stated that the primary objective of any vacant residential property tax would be to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand.  However, before introducing such a tax, it is vital to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties and the reasons they are vacant. This is the reason the housing for all strategy includes an action for my Department to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax.<\/p> <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 has accordingly enabled Revenue to collect certain information on vacant properties in the local property tax, LPT, return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-25.  The extended deadline for submission of returns was Wednesday 10 November.  The information on vacancy in the LPT returns, in respect of approximately 2 million properties, is currently being analysed by Revenue and together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and inform the design of a vacant property tax.<\/p> <p>  It is important to identify the reasons for vacancy and whether this is long or short term in nature.  There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.  Appropriate exemptions from any charge would have to be considered in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy.<\/p> <p>  I want to make it clear that it is my intention to introduce a vacant property tax.  However, the matter needs further consideration and the information Revenue will be collecting will be an input into what we will do, because we will need to come up with a tax which plays a role in encouraging and changing the use of vacant properties.  Once the information from the returns has been collated and drawing on other available information, we will be in a better position to design a vacant property tax and assess its merits and precise design.  As part of Housing for All, I will be treating this matter with the seriousness it deserves and will be looking at the introduction of a vacant residential property tax as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#F03700","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>When I put this forward in 2018, the Minister rejected the idea of a vacant property tax and he cited the Indecon report which recommended against a vacant property tax.
