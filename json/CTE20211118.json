The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask members and all others in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending the meeting physically and to use the sanitisers provided.  They should maintain an appropriate level of social distance and masks should be worn at all times, except when speaking.  I ask people to co-operate with these measures.<\/p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  This morning, we engage with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine: the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 32 - Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 6 re Covid-19 restart grant schemes.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment: Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General; Ms Pauline Mulligan, head of corporate services division; Mr. Declan Hughes, head of indigenous enterprise, SME and entrepreneurship division; and Mr. Cathal O'Gorman, finance officer.  From the Department of Public expenditure and Reform, we are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Georgina Hughes-Elders, principal officer, and Ms Jessica Lawless, assistant principal, from the Department the of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote section.  They are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Vice Chairman to ensure the privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if the statements of a witness are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, that witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that such a direction is complied with.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions under Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.<\/p><p> I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. S&eacute;amus McCarthy, to make his opening statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#A00600","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637227800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 32 Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicates gross expenditure of &euro;1.76 billion was incurred in 2020.  This represented an increase of 89% over the 2019 level of expenditure, due mainly to the provision of funding for Covid-19 related schemes.  In a number of expenditure areas, the level of funding provided for Covid-19 related spending was significantly more than was actually required in the year.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 spending was distributed across three expenditure programmes of varying size.  The largest expenditure programme was in jobs and enterprise development.  This accounted for &euro;1.3 billion, or 72% of the total spent in 2020.  Key areas of spending under the programme included &euro;652 million for Covid-19 related business restart grant schemes which was routed through Enterprise Ireland; &euro;192 million in other funding for Enterprise Ireland including its normal programmes; &euro;198 million provided to the IDA; &euro;79 million for local enterprise development; &euro;48 million transferred to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and just under &euro;25 million transferred to Microfinance Ireland, to fund various business loan schemes. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the innovation programme in 2020 was &euro;414 million, which was similar to the level of spending in 2019.  This included spending of &euro;332 million on the science and technology development programme; &euro;24 million on the programme for research in third level institutions; &euro;24 million on subscriptions to international organisations; and &euro;19 million for the &lsquo;disruptive technologies&rsquo; fund.  Expenditure on the business regulation programme was &euro;77 million in 2020, again, similar to the 2019 expenditure level.  This funding supported the direct operation by the Department of certain regulatory functions including the Workplace Relations Commission, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Companies Registration Office and the Patents Office.  Funding was also provided from the programme for independent bodies, such as the Health and Safety Authority, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p> <p>  Receipts into the vote amounted to just under &euro;50 million in 2020.  These substantially relate to fees for services operated by the Department, including employment permit fees in respect of foreign workers; Companies Registration Office filing fees; and trade mark and patent fees.  Receipts also include retained staff pension contributions, both from the Department&rsquo;s own staff, and the staff of agencies under its aegis.  The surplus remaining unspent at the year-end was just over &euro;182 million.  The Department secured the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;106 million in unspent capital funding to 2021.  The balance of &euro;76 million was due for surrender to the Central Fund of the Exchequer. The appropriation account records the cash transactions related to the vote in the year of account.  In addition the vote has incurred a contingent liability arising from the operation of a number of credit guarantee schemes.  This is explained in note 2.9 to the account which indicates that, at 31 December 2020, the Department&rsquo;s maximal exposure under the guarantee schemes was &euro;80 million on outstanding loans totalling &euro;113 million.  This was up from a maximum exposure of &euro;5 million at the end of 2019 on outstanding loans of &euro;30 million. <\/p> <p>  As outlined in chapter 6, small to medium businesses received grants from Vote 32 totalling around &euro;633 million in respect of interruptions to trading as a result of Covid-19 related restrictions in 2020.  The schemes were operated and funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with the payments being made by the relevant local authorities. The funding was routed to the local authorities via Enterprise Ireland.  The purpose of the grant was to assist businesses with costs arising from the restrictions.  Under the scheme provisions, businesses were invited to self-declare their eligibility.  Conditions of the grant included that the business was a commercial enterprise operating from a premises liable to local authority commercial rates; had incurred, or expected to incur, a 25% or more loss of turnover between April and June 2020; intended to retain staff on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and committed to remain open for trading or to reopen.  Businesses were not required to explain how the money was to be used, and vouching for the manner in which the grants were applied was not required.  <\/p> <p>  A grant scheme that relies on self-declaration should have a number of key controls.  One of these is the completion of post-payment checks to ensure that claimants had satisfied the conditions of the scheme and were accordingly entitled to the payments they received.  The conditions of the scheme were such that a significant number of businesses were likely to qualify for the financial assistance available.  Nevertheless there is a risk that claims were submitted and paid where the prescribed conditions were not met.  The Department signalled at the outset of the scheme that reviews of eligibility for the grants would be undertaken, but these have not yet occurred.  As a result, there is no basis of assurance about entitlement of grant recipients to the amounts paid.  At the time of completing this report the Department was in the process of procuring an independent audit of the scheme.  Subsequently, the Department plans to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1637227800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I understand this is the first appearance of Dr. Quinn as Accounting Officer before the committee so I take the opportunity to particularly welcome her and wish her every success in her brief.

I am pleased to be here before the committee this morning.  The Chair has introduced my team and her thank her for that.<\/p> <p>  As members know 2020 was a year like no other and Covid-19 had an immediate impact on the Department, on the economy and on our citizens, while dealing with Brexit at the same time.  Our budget, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, increased hugely to &euro;1.95 billion which was double our allocation of &euro;977 million in 2019.  This allowed us to roll out significant and targeted supports for enterprise, including the restart and the restart plus grants, the sustaining enterprise fund, the Covid products scheme and the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  It also allowed us to significantly expand other supports such as the working capital and future growth loan schemes and the Microfinance Ireland Covid loans scheme.  In addition we responded with a large number of non-fiscal measures in areas of company regulation, health and safety, workplace relations as well as new advisory supports.  One of the most significant measures was the restart grant scheme.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his report, grants to the value of &euro;640 million were paid to enterprises of which &euro;633 million was paid out by ourselves and &euro;7 million by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The local authorities were used to specifically and quickly get that money out to businesses and we provided those businesses impacted by the pandemic with modest amounts of cash.  The aim was to meet the additional costs that all firms incurred due to Covid-19 and to preserve, in particular, economic activity in our country.  It was delivered in conjunction with other Government supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment.  <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report makes two specific recommendations on auditing and evaluation.  The Department accepts both recommendations and is committed to implementing them.  I should emphasise that any consideration of the oversight of the restart schemes must have due regard to the circumstances in which those schemes were designed and launched, and in particular the need to have them available as urgently as possible.  I am very pleased that those schemes, after a Government decision in early May, relaunched on 22 May, which took huge effort by the officials of the Department, and others.<\/p><p>Apart from the restart schemes, we also rolled out other measures.  Some &euro;98 million was allocated for the sustaining enterprise fund, which assisted 340 businesses to stay in business and contribute to the recovery of our economy.  The online retail scheme was hugely successful.  The business planning voucher, the enterprise centres and the Brexit ready for customs grant were all very important.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland had an overall net loss of 872 jobs but created 16,500 new jobs, with 65% of those jobs based regionally.  IDA Ireland also got specific grant aid for Covid.  That scheme has considerable potential for us into the future.  Notwithstanding the pandemic, IDA Ireland continues to win new investments, with 246 new investments secured last year and 20,000 new jobs.  I am pleased that half of those went to regional locations, which is one of our policy aims.<\/p><p> The local enterprise offices were very important.  We increased their funding by 170% last year.  The business continuity voucher scheme supported more than 12,000 businesses at a cost of &euro;20 million.  The trading online voucher scheme would, in the recent past, have involved 1,000 vouchers annually.  Last year, vouchers were sent to 13,000 recipients to allow companies to go online.  That was hugely successful for small businesses.  I am delighted to report that employment in that regard totalled 35,000 at local level.<\/p><p> We also responded significantly in terms of liquidity to business, which was a considerable factor, particularly at the time when banks were not lending.  We provided almost &euro;50 million for the Covid and Brexit working capital loan schemes and the future growth loan scheme.  Those schemes included 3,000 loans to businesses, worth &euro;548 million.<\/p><p> Probably the most significant was the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  In the first four months it was open, 1,890 loans were given out to a value of &euro;98 million.  The scheme has continued to grow strongly.  We are now at almost 8,000 loans with a value of just over &euro;550 million.<\/p><p> Microfinance Ireland was key.  It was the first agency to market with a Covid loan fund in March 2020 and 1,300 firms availed of it.  That involved a six-month interest and repayment holiday, as well as reduced interest.  It supported 3,000 jobs.<\/p><p> We also looked to innovation.  I will later touch on the disruptive technology fund, which funded 43 innovative projects.  We see that as the future for Ireland.<\/p><p> Apart from direct financial supports, we established a call centre and provided guides for business and a whole range of communications material.  Legislation was to the fore.  We changed company law and employment rights.  We recently introduced a new examinership-lite process, the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, to assist our small and micro companies.<\/p><p> The Health and Safety Authority is important. It is at the forefront of workplace safety.  It developed the Return to Work Safely Protocol and has revised it several times since.  We are working on it now.  It also took on a new role as the lead agency in co-ordinating compliance right across Government.  All of our agencies and bodies, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Companies Registration Office and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement played vital roles.  They adapted their services.  They were agile and flexible.  They responded, postponed regulatory requirements and provided advice.  <\/p><p> While the challenges of Covid remain, the reopening of our economy and the return to the workplace has allowed our businesses to get back trading and to remain in business.  Unemployment has fallen from a high of 31.5% in April 2020 to 7.9%.  We are not where we were before the pandemic but we certainly feel that our supports have been key to achieving this progress.<\/p><p> I note that, with the exception of &euro;6 million provided to the Department at the end of 2020, all of the additional funding was expended solely on business supports.  There were no additional administrative or staffing resources incurred in the Department.  These schemes were developed and delivered under enormous pressure by staff in the Department with our offices and agencies.  The combined efforts were such that we were able to deliver in a timely and efficient manner.  I must put on my record my thanks for the commitment and dedication of those teams.  I am happy to take any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637227800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Quinn.

She has outlined a couple of the key points around the gross expenditure of the Department and its growth in 2020 in comparison to 2019 as the Department reacted to the situation around Covid-19.  Looking at the restart grant, there seems to be quite a number of concerns around the whole process to test eligibility and the effectiveness of its implementation.  That has caused some concern.  The restart grant was important for many businesses and provided them with the financial support they required to reopen.  One could argue that many businesses which felt outside the criteria for that support needed it while others which may not have needed it received the support.  I will ask a couple of questions about the restart grant.  How did it come about in terms of the Department's operations?  How did the notion of providing this type of support arise on day one?  Could Dr. Quinn outline that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#C00300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637227800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I absolutely will.  It arose as a result of many of the meetings we had with stakeholders at that time.  Our advice to Government was that companies were really struggling.  They were struggling to provide the type of Covid equipment that would allow them to remain open.  They were struggling with their banks.  They were struggling with their cash flow because many of them had closed due to Government restrictions.  There was an immediate need to cover fixed costs and the cost of opening, reopening and adapting their businesses.  One of the conditions we were very keen on and that was built into the scheme was that companies would maintain employment.  That was an important factor.  We did not want to wipe out a whole range of small companies.  There are approximately 250,000 small companies in Ireland.  Very many of those are sole traders so they did not come into that scheme.  We were intent on trying to maintain employees in their jobs.

Under the criteria, companies had to be rate payers to qualify.  They had to have a turnover of less than &euro;5 million.  We were aiming this at small businesses and, in the first round, it was for companies with 50 or fewer employees.  It was aimed at the small business sector.  We expanded that in the second round, the restart plus grant.  Eligibility was expanded to include companies with 250 employees because we picked up from our feedback that companies were struggling.  We expanded the scheme to cater for that.  It was based on self-declaration and we made it simple.  We are quite satisfied that the companies which applied were eligible under the criteria we were maintaining.  A huge number of people are listed as small businesses but work in the construction sector or are sole traders.

Approximately two months after its introduction, the scheme was replaced by the restart grant plus scheme.  In terms of that process, why did it negate the requirement to complete a review from the Department's point of view?  Dr. Quinn outlined that there were some teething problems and issues.  She referred to tourism.  I was going to use that example because there were many non-rate paying businesses there which were excluded that perhaps should have been given that support.  In my view, their exclusion was a great shame.  Many businesses fell by the wayside as a consequence.  On the fact that the Department stated that the process negated the requirement to complete a review, would Dr. Quinn mind outlining to us why that happened?

From our perspective, we reviewed on a weekly basis.  We sat down and looked at who was gaining and who was not, and that allowed us to adapt the scheme, as the Deputy pointed out, for other cohorts very quickly.  In the normal course of events, it would take us more than a year to design and roll out a scheme like this.  We did it in a matter of weeks.  I am quite satisfied that the review kept control of the numbers and that we were plugging gaps.<\/p> <p>  I would also mention again that we adapted it on a number of occasions for various counties that went into lockdown, such as Laois, Offaly and Kildare.

There is an opportunity here for the Department to look at the geographical breakdown in terms of the different local authorities' administrative areas and examine the ability to work with areas where the Department feels that there are teething problems that we need to be dealt with.  If we are going to be dealing with a situation - I hope it does not happen, but it would be prudent for us to plan in this direction - whereby businesses may be forced to close again because of Covid restrictions, then I am of the view that this should be the subject of close scrutiny and analysis by the Department.  Depending on where a business is located, and in the context of the remits of certain Departments, it is not fair that it would not be given the same level of support that colleagues in other local authority areas would be when money is being drawn down from the national schemes.  I am not having a dig at my own local authority - to be fair to Cork County Council, it has been excellent to deal with - but this matter has been raised to me by other elected representatives from across the country.  It can be seen from the data and the analysis that are available to us, as public representatives.

We rely heavily on colleagues in other Departments and in the industry sector who head up those plans to keep us in the loop on them.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, from our perspective, we keep this matter under review.

Many areas in the Cork East constituency, which I represent, and in other parts of the country that are outside of the greater Dublin area suffer from high unemployment and do not have sources of local employment.  I refer to the town of Youghal, from which I originally come.  Deputy Sherlock is beside me, and Mallow is in a similar situation, as are Fermoy and other towns in our constituency.

IDA Ireland has been successful in regional balance in recent years.  I mentioned that more than 50% of all jobs are now outside of Dublin.  I will mention a number of features.  First, IDA Ireland runs the regional action plan.  That takes a regional approach and is led by businesspeople in the regions, which gives us a good oversight role.  Enterprise Ireland's latest figure is that more than 60% of new jobs are being created outside Dublin.<\/p> <p>  We do not tend to think about a particular area, for example, Youghal, which the Deputy mentioned.  We tend to think of it as a region because there are opportunities for people to commute and travel.  We focus strongly on the region and to the forefront of our policy and aim is to have regional balance.  I should say, particularly from the IDA Ireland side, that companies coming into Ireland make their own decisions.  Quite often, they want to be beside an airport, water source or other feature, depending on their needs.  We cannot control that but we encourage them by providing regional sites.  IDA Ireland purchases advanced sites.  We have advanced manufacturing coming up in Limerick and we try to work that closely on a regional basis which provides a basis for companies to come in, create employment and take up opportunities in other areas outside Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1637227800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming the Secretary General and her officials.

They are important questions for us to be able to stand over, not least in case, though hopefully not, of future schemes of this nature.

The point we make is that when we send money into the European Space Agency, the companies get contracts to the value of what we invest, so it is a very important approach for us.  More recently, we saw &euro;13 million won by them.<\/p> <p>  The number of companies has grown by 60% in the past five years.  It is small.  It is up from the 55 companies we had in 2015 and it is now at 87, but they are key, niche companies.  The important part about them is that because they engage across with the IDA sector as well, quite often there can be partnerships and other areas we can then exploit for Ireland to be at the leading global edge on innovation.<\/p> <p>  For us, where we have additional funding, we have put it in there.  In 2020, for example, three Irish companies were selected by the European Space Agency to develop solutions on satellite and satellite systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1637227800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Excuse me, did I miss the figure of how much we have contributed to the European Space Agency?

In Covid, the HSA initially started off with a relatively small staff and we needed to expand the inspectorate for Covid.  The HSA took on the lead role in co-ordinating other resources.  We now have inspectorates working collectively from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Education and any of the Government agencies that have an inspectorate.  The environmental health officer is very important.  In total, there are about 700 inspectors now working on the protocol as part of their normal inspection duties.<\/p> <p>  For the HSA, more than 15,000 investigations and inspections were carried out but, overall, there were in the region of 50,000 inspections of Covid compliance.

It is just to have an overview and an understanding of it.  Another issue, which probably is not to do with the accounts, relates to page 23 of the Department's Covid-19 and Brexit planning document, specifically the permits section of the Department and delivering employment permits.  I understand the Department concentrated on the health sector, which I very much appreciate, and any interaction I had with the Department in regard to that sector was brilliant and immediately taken care of.  However there are other sectors, such as the road transport sector, which has been applying for an employment permit for four stipulated countries and I am told the process has taken between six and nine months.  There is the added difficulty whereby the Department must correspond with the Department of Transport in regard to the driving licence, but Dr. Quinn will have heard and noted, particularly of late, that there is an even further difficulty and crisis within that sector.<\/p> <p>  Will Dr. Quinn outline for me how she correlates with the Department of Transport to try to speed up the process?  I note the Minister of State, Deputy English, said the quota requirement has been removed.

However, the hours cannot be delivered so, essentially, the funding will never be used.  I hope Mr. Hughes understands me.

In the healthcare sector, for example, we have a difficulty in the nursing home care area.  Have there been discussions with the Department of Health in dealing with that?

In the private nursing homes, there are about 23,000 residents, so a fairly substantial number of staff are needed.<\/p><p>Quite a number of people who worked in the area have retired for very genuine reasons.

Five items of correspondence have been flagged in this category.<\/p> <p>  I will move to consider correspondence from Accounting Officers, Ministers, or both, and relating to follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No. 872B was received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 5 November 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from the fact that the Revenue did not accept certain recommendations in the committee's most recent report on its engagement with Revenue.  The committee asked Revenue to clarify to what extent it can investigate the financial and sectoral implications of a voluntary PAYE system agreed by Revenue and courier firms in March 1997, as well as a copy of the 2019 European Commission inspection report on the control strategy for customs values and repayments.  I have flagged this item for discussion, as have Deputies Carthy and Stanley.  I suggest we hold it over until next week as I know it is of interest to Deputy Stanley.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 873B is correspondence from Ms Marie-Claire Maney, chairperson of the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 8 November 2021.  It responds to the committee's request for information relating to tax settlements between the Revenue Commissioners and Perrigo.  The chairperson states that due to its statutory obligations around the confidentiality of appellants, rather than any reluctance to respond to oversight, the commission cannot provide such information.  The chairperson goes on to detail the relevant statutory provisions, stating that if a settlement is agreed at any stage before the commission makes a determination, the appeal is treated as having been withdrawn and the parties need only notify the commission of the settlement.  As such, the commission has no role in the tax settlement agreed between Perrigo and the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  The chairperson also provides an update on the current status of the top ten appeals by quantum.  The most recent update was provided for our meeting with the commission on 8 July.  It is worth noting that the aggregate quantum of tax under appeal has reduced from &euro;4.5 billion in January 2021 to &euro;1.55 billion on 8 November 2021.  We have also requested detailed information from Revenue relating to this settlement, which is due today.  It is proposed to note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Carthy and I have flagged it.<\/p> <p>  No. 874B is correspondence from Ms Cliodhna Guy, interim chief executive officer of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, dated 8 November 2021.  It provides further information requested by the committee about the installation of CCTV cameras at racecourses.<\/p><p>The interim CEO states that it has concluded the evaluation of the tenders for the installation of CCTV systems in racecourse stable yards, and that the board continues to work to the previously stated timeframe for installation to be completed at each racecourse prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  The interim CEO also notes that the cost of the system is considerably higher than what had been allocated by Horse Racing Ireland previously and on that basis the matter is currently with the Horse Racing Ireland board for approval.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Deputy Imelda Munster and I flagged this item, but I do not think she is present.  It would be useful to get a breakdown of the cost of the new system to include the installation costs and an update pack when the sanction to the purchase is granted.  I presume it will do that, but it would be no harm for us to request it.<\/p><p> No. 875B is correspondence from Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 8 November 2021 in which he provides information on updated arrangements for public bodies presenting their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, following their audit, the arrangements for laying them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It arises from a 2018 report of the last Committee of Public Accounts, which highlighted the inconsistency in the obligations of when public bodies must present their financial accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.<\/p><p> The new arrangements, as set out in Circular 24 of 2021, require that, unless otherwise specified in legislation, annual accounts should be presented to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit no later than three months after the close of the financial year.  As the accounts are laid before the Houses and brought to the attention of this committee by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the circular also removes the need for audited bodies to arrange for copies of audited accounts to be submitted to the committee.  This requirement was not being complied with in the majority of cases in any event.  In most cases, once the Comptroller and Auditor General has certified accounts, the accounts must be laid before the Houses within three months.  Members will be aware that this committee has a standing agreement to write to any bodies that are late in laying their audited accounts before the Houses.  However, this circular, as was the case with the one it replaces, includes a requirement, at paragraph 9, that the clerk to this committee be notified where there is an unavoidable delay beyond these time limits.  In practice, this is not being done.  If it were, it would remove the need for us to write to bodies to request explanations for late laying of accounts.<\/p><p> It is proposed to note and publish the item, to thank the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for providing the updated circular and to request that it remind Departments of the requirement to inform the clerk if statutory accounts are being presented later than the specified time limits and to explain the delay.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I hope our consistent following up where accounts were late had a role in putting that onto a more formal footing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#S00600","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637227800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>It is very welcome that the Department has taken the effort to refresh the instructions to Departments to remove certain anomalies and so on.

It is proposed to provide Nursing Homes Ireland with the updates the committee has received in respect of the implementation of its recommendations and to advise that the Department of Health will appear before the committee on 16 December.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Deputy Munster flagged an item of correspondence.  We could hold it over.  That is probably the fairest thing to do, so she has an opportunity to address it.  If we can move on to the work programme, it is agreed until the end of the year.  We previously agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November.  It is suggested that we do so next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Does any member wish to raise anything in respect of the work plan?  We will be coming back to it next week anyway.  Is there any other business?  I take it there is not.  We will briefly go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 25 November, when we will engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021111800002#T01200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637227800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 2.52 p.m. and adjourned at 2.53 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 November 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters","time":1637193600,"counter":292},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:40<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 09:40<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Holly Cairns, Erin McGreehan, Se\u00e1n Canney, Fiona O'Loughlin, Emer Higgins, Mary Seery Kearney.

Due to these unprecedented circumstances, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical issues arise.<\/p> <p>  Before we commence formal proceedings, I must begin with some formalities and advise our witnesses on the matter of privilege.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Before I call Ms Olga Wehrly to make her opening remarks, Senator Erin McGreehan wishes to make a statement in regard to her relationship to one of the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#A00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I want to declare the beginning of the meeting that my sister, Lorna McGreehan, is one of witnesses.

I have a connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, EDS.  It means the collagen my body makes is faulty, so my joints are really bendy and it affects my organs in varying degrees.  My daughter, who has it too, also has anaphylactic allergies and significant asthma.  I also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, which is a common comorbidity with EDS.<\/p><p>Since we are in the middle of a pandemic, I should add that I have had long Covid since January 2020.<\/p><p> EDS is a multi-systemic disorder of which there are many subtypes.  Most are diagnosed genetically, but there are no markers yet for the subtype I have.  It was flagged when I lived in the UK in 2012.  When I moved back to Ireland in 2013, I set about the laborious task of trying to find an assessment.  There were no EDS specialists in the country at the time, and almost a decade later, there still are none.  This is disastrous for families like mine, since usually more than one member is affected, and EDS presents completely differently in everybody.  There is no one overseeing our care, which needs a multidisciplinary approach.  A GP is the first port of call, but it is outside their wheelhouse, so to speak.  In order to access medical and physical therapies in the Irish healthcare system, we generally have to be referred individually for each body or brain part and explain the disorder from scratch each time.  Although awareness has increased, this whole lengthy process could easily be avoided.  The resultant drain on everyone&rsquo;s time and money could be avoided by multi-systemic overviews, saving families time on travel to and from a plethora of appointments and risking being considered a hypochondriac for having a systemic illness.  <\/p><p> I have travelled to the UK for treatment by EDS specialists in the hypermobility clinic in London.  I had no choice, as I wanted to put a treatment plan in place to get back working.  I work as an actor, which can be quite physical.  There were no options here, which is contrary to the UNCRPD.  The HSE does not cover these trips under the treatment abroad scheme.  Many of us have Chiari malformation in varying degrees, which can be quite dangerous.  For us, it is diagnosed with an upright MRI scanner, and we do not have this service in Ireland either.  A scan in the UK can cost &pound;2,000, excluding travel and accommodation and, again, this is not covered by the HSE treatment abroad scheme.<\/p><p> This wastes lots of time and resources for us and the health service.  Many of us have had to go private to be assessed, where possible, treated, and for maintenance of the many anomalous chronic EDS issues.  This is costly.  Other hidden costs involve buying support garments and modifying our cars to make them easier to drive.  For example, I drive an automatic car now.  Some people need more extreme modification.  Costs for heat pads and regular physiotherapy all mount up.  Without regular physiotherapy, I would not be mobile.  I do it so I can work and parent.  I have had access to amazing physiotherapy through the HSE for a few years, and then a physiotherapist came to my area who had no interest in EDS and no interest in helping me, so I ended up going private.  It costs me thousands every year to do private physiotherapy, without which I would not be able to walk or work with ease, and I am one of the extremely lucky ones.  I am paying through the nose so I can participate in society, but I should not have to.<\/p><p> The mobility grant, which was to aid people with walking difficulties, was stopped to new applicants in 2013.  A new scheme was due to replace it but, as far as I am aware, nothing has transpired.  The mobility certificate is available to those who are significantly impaired, but for many of us who are chronic sufferers, we fall between the cracks.  We are not considered disabled enough, and therein lies most of the indignity of the application process.  The refusals for domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and disability allowance are such a common thing that people in support groups are advised to apply over and over.  I have never applied for it.  I find the social welfare system hostile and intrusive at best, and I do not have the stamina for the overly complicated application process.<\/p><p> I am lucky to have a medical card on medical grounds, but I have no idea how I would afford EpiPens for my daughter, inhalers for both of us, medication and the many doctor appointments we have throughout the year without it.  The renewal process for the medical card is stressful and humiliating.  By the time your card is granted, you are panicking about having to reapply for the year following.  I must pay for letters from my GP to reapply and prove how needy we are, despite the reality that our circumstances are not likely to change from year to year.<\/p><p> Disability payments are means tested, meaning many people with EDS would lose all their family supports should they, for example, meet a new partner who is expected to shoulder the burden of a family's medical costs.  Further, should they want to be fulfilled and try to work as much as they can, they may lose access to supports like their medical card and other health services.  This puts people like me in an even more marginalised category, where we are left under a glass ceiling and unable to fulfil our potential.  If we work, we have supports removed.  If we move in with a partner, we have supports removed.<\/p><p> Most people I know are overwhelmed and not able to work as a result of bureaucracy, or are supporting families on low income rather than being able to do the jobs they previously enjoyed, even on a part-time basis.  There are no strategies to keep people in work because the support system is not tiered; it is all or nothing.  Rather than this binary view of our health and welfare system, we should be creating an environment where it is beneficial to all of us, and society as a whole, whereby people feel they can achieve their potential.  If we do not feel useful, we are not fulfilled, and we have every right to feel useful.<\/p><p> Anxiety, depression and neurodivergence are common issues with EDS, but again, there are no supports for this in the public health service.  There is no public adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, assessment pathway in Ireland, despite the HSE website saying the contrary and making public reports about it year in, year out.  The website for ADHD for adults looks like an advertorial.  There is no route progression that you can access and have a look at.  It took me more than 20 years and hundreds of euro to access an assessment.  My education experience was significantly affected by ADHD.  I dropped out of university and I struggled with disorganisation for years.  I now work as an actor and it affects how I learn dialogue.  I had to pay privately for these services for two decades on a low income because the provision is not there.  I am now able to access my local HSE mental health team, but they are so understaffed that I have had appointments cancelled due to no doctors being available.  The health system is creaking at the seams.  It seems almost unrealistic of me to expect improvement to disability services when there is a sparse and burned out staff.  We are at the bottom and we are suffering because of the inadequate structures.  My daughter has significant asthma.  We have seen her consultant once since 2019 and she will not be seen again until mid-2022, despite a few  accident and emergency trips in the last 12 months.<\/p><p> I have long Covid since January 2020, which has caused significant problems throughout the year with breathing, driving, walking, cooking, dressing, my voice and the school run.  I estimate it has cost me a few thousand euro this year alone in consultant fees and diagnostic tests in the private sector, despite attending one public hospital long Covid clinics as well, which was seriously busy.  Without those private appointments, my recovery would not be as advanced as it is now.  However, I had to pay for it and I could ill afford it.  I am one of the lucky ones.  There are no long Covid facilities for children in this country.  There are no statistics being kept on long Covid sufferers in Ireland.  Why not?  If you do not count us, we do not exist.  It is a disaster that is happening now.<\/p><p> That brings me to the end of my piece.  As someone said to me yesterday, it is not our issues that are expensive, it is inequality itself that is so costly to society as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Olga Wehrly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us, Ms Wehrly.

Have members ever experienced a phone battery that does not get them through the day, or a battery that dies exactly when they need it?  Imagine if that battery were your body, and you woke up one day and your internal battery was only charged to 20% and it could never be fully recharged.  You would need to get your priorities right if you did not want to get sicker.  What would you choose, showering or having a conversation with a friend?  Imagine this is your reality every day and no doctor can tell you what is wrong.  You are on your own.<\/p> <p>  I am 53 years old and my life changed in 2014.  From working full time, I could no longer get out of bed.  It took me five years to get the correct diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis\/chronic fatigue syndrome, ME\/CFS.  It is a complex, multi-system disease and the typical diagnostic criterion is that if we exert ourselves outside our energy envelope, our symptoms get worse.  The deterioration may be immediate or delayed, and can last days, weeks, months or forever.  Currently, I am mostly housebound, but on my best days when I am able to go outside my home, I use a mobility scooter.  For years I have been bed bound. <\/p> <p>  I will focus on three things essential for myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, sufferers: healthcare, mobility and housing.  Adequate support starts with healthcare.  The HSE currently has no pathway to care for ME patients and not a single official ME consultant.  Many consultants and GPs dismiss ME or have no knowledge of it.  The result is that many patients get no diagnosis or treatment.<\/p><p>In some cases, patients are unable to access healthcare as they cannot leave their beds or houses and home visits are not available.  Without early and correct diagnosis, patients risk permanent deterioration.  This happened to me when I tried exercising my way out of illness.  It ended with collapse and I never got back to my previous level of functionality.  Even if there is no medicine specifically for ME, there are possible medical interventions to alleviate some severe symptoms.  In my case, I now take medication that helps me to remain upright for longer periods.<\/p><p> Without a supportive consultant, you are also alone in your fight for financial survival.  After five years of limbo and relying on my partner for the basics of care and food, I could get a diagnosis and treatment that improved my quality of life.  This could happen only because a friend drove me - I was horizontal in her car - from Dublin to Tullamore hospital, where I saw a consultant with a special interest in ME.  He is accessible publicly only if you live in the catchment area.  Before Covid, he used to see patients privately one afternoon a week; now, we have nobody.  Ireland desperately needs public ME clinics in each hospital group.  We need healthcare staff trained in ME and willing to keep up with the biomedical research in the field.<\/p><p> A consultant is also essential to accessing relevant mobility aids.  I missed out on being outdoors for years and it took an incredible toll on my mental health.  It was not primarily the isolation that got to me.  I desperately missed the sun on my face, the wind in my hair, even rain in order that I could still feel I existed in the physical world.  I have a tiny mobility scooter now, thanks to a friend who organised a fundraiser for me. It is the only mobility aid we can get into and store in our living room.  We have no access to a car and my ability to use public transport is extremely limited.  I really need a power chair and a ramp but, if renting privately, you have no right to adapt your housing.  The welfare system is designed assuming that disabled people who do not own their home live in social housing.  This is not true.  My household is now on the council's list for adapted housing, thanks to my consultant, but how long will we wait?<\/p><p> In the meantime, despite my partner and I both getting the invalidity pension, we do not get fuel allowance.  The maximum household income you are allowed in order to qualify is &euro;1,509 per month, while the average private rent in Ireland is currently &euro;1,334 per month.  We cannot afford to keep the heat on.  The system increases the risk of my health deteriorating further.<\/p><p> I cannot expect society to give me my previous life back, but I expect everyone with a disability to get their basic needs met, access to appropriate healthcare, mobility and suitable, warm housing.  We deserve a life with dignity, quality and independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna-Karin Ulpe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ulpe and invite Ms McGreehan to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#C00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I have lupus, which is an auto-immune disease, and I am visually impaired due to medication I was taking for lupus.  A wide range of problems affect people who have disabilities or suffer from chronic illnesses.  Some of these issues are small and some are massive.  Disability awareness training should be compulsory for all who deal with people.  Not all disabilities are on show.  I have been told that I do not look like a blind person.  People need to learn and I do not speak for all disabilities.  I also need training.  Change needs to come from the top down.  Every Department needs to have an ethos of inclusion, not just a box-ticking exercise.  Training needs to be given to schools and colleges in order that this can become the norm rather than the exception.<\/p> <p>  I do not want special treatment but I do want equality and a level playing field.  When technology is available but cost prohibitive, it is soul destroying.  Grants should be given to the person, not the employer.  No one should be indentured to an employer.  If appropriate technology was available to all with disabilities, it would improve job prospects and career development.  This should be dealt with by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We want to be employed.  Having assistive tech grants based in social welfare seems out of place.  Help to encourage people with disabilities into the workforce has to be a win for all.  Having a purpose, getting up in morning and going to work is so beneficial to a person's mental and physical health, disabled or not, but so many obstacles are put in their way.  Having to take annual leave to attend doctor's appointments seems totally unfair.  Annual leave should be used to rest but, alas, that does not always happen.  Losing benefits because you are marginally over the income limits is not right.<\/p> <p>  I have always worked.  I might be in agony and have loads of obstacles in front of me but I still work, and I think that has stood to me mentally.  I am lucky to have supportive family and friends but additional supports are not always available, and sometimes it feels counterproductive even if they are offered.  Should I burden my carer, my husband, with another journey?  Should I use the last of my annual leave when I feel exhausted and could do with a day off?  Financial pressure is increased tenfold when you have a disability.  Families struggle, and then there are additional costs such as bills, travel expenses and medication.<\/p> <p>  The long-term illness list has not been touched since its inception in 1972.  Lupus was first named in 1971.  Why can this not be added?  Surely, after 50 years, it is time to look at it again.  It should not come down to finances whether a person with a disability can go out to work or not.  Running a car is getting more and more expensive, but when you are living in rural Ireland, a car is a necessity, not a luxury.  Only 24% of people who are visually impaired or blind in Ireland are employed.  This needs to change.  We should not be made to feel grateful for the scraps from the table.  Some people ask, \"Sure haven't you got a job?\"  I know I am lucky in many ways, but it could have been easier and still can be made much easier by letting me reach my full potential.<\/p> <p>  It is up to the members of this committee to make changes.

I was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's three years ago, at the age of 53.  I am married with two sons and live in County Wexford.  I started to notice I had symptoms such as slowness of movement, fatigue and unexplained pain.  I would sometimes have a tremor, which started to appear more often if I was under stress.<\/p> <p>  It was thought I might have fibromyalgia and an essential tremor.  My sense of smell was affected and I was referred to a consultant who did a scan, which came back clear, and I was then given steroids, which showed no improvement.  My shoulder was sore, so I was referred to a physiotherapist.  My left hand and wrist were painful and typing long documents became difficult.  My sleep was disturbed and I would be awake for several hours at night.  I also noticed I was not swinging my left arm when I was walking and I started to drag my foot at times.<\/p> <p>  I went through many years of wondering what was wrong and why was I feeling like this.  We need more awareness of conditions such as early onset Parkinson's, as per Article 8 of the UNCRPD on awareness raising.  My GP sent a referral to a neurologist and, even with private health insurance, it took three months to get an appointment.  Going through the public system at that time would have meant waiting about 18 months because there are not enough neurologists in Ireland.<\/p><p> It is a lot to take in when you are told you have a progressive, incurable disease.   I left the neurologist's office in total shock and wondered what I would do.  I was given a prescription which I paid for myself in the first two months because I had never heard of the long-term illness card.  I went through many emotions as I learned that my life would no longer be how I had imagined.  It was difficult to tell our sons, who were 21 and 18 at the time.  I also wondered who else I should tell and when, and if I would be treated differently.  It was also coming up to our 25th wedding anniversary, but I did not feel like celebrating and thought: what a gift for my husband.<\/p><p> I was working in accounts at the time.  I had hoped to have worked for many more years, but as the months went on, I was finding it more difficult due to lack of sleep and pain.  I did not know what options were available to help me to stay working.  I had not heard of EmployAbility or work adaptation grants.  So, nine months after my diagnosis, I gave up work due to the symptoms of early onset Parkinson's.<\/p><p> I felt very isolated, being diagnosed with a disease that normally affects older people.  My closest experience of Parkinson's was with a family member who was diagnosed when he was in his 80s.  I wondered if I was the only person in County Wexford with this condition.  Eventually, I met people my own age, and through this peer support I got information on what I needed to do to try to live as well as possible with Parkinson's.<\/p><p> I had balance problems in the beginning, because I did not know that I needed to do certain exercises to help this.  I was in a supermarket one day and I went from just standing to a stumble.  I could see from the look on a lady's face that she assumed I was drunk.  I have also been told that I look as if there is nothing wrong with me, but it is only my immediate family that get the true picture of what it is like to live with the disease: the fatigue; being up for hours at night; suffering stiffness and pain; toes curling under making it more difficult to walk; planning your activities when your medication is working and you are not \"off\"; struggling down the stairs with pain; and trying to do household chores when fatigue has set in.  My day now consists of alarms for medication, timing meals so that they does not interfere with medication, physical exercise and voice practice.  I used to be able to garden all day long, but now I have to come in after an hour to rest.  Some days, I just cannot do much at all due to persistent fatigue and pain and spend a lot of the day on the couch.  Eating a meal takes longer because I am slower cutting up food and my ability to chew is affected as the reduced amount of dopamine in the brain affects all my muscles, even my tongue.  My cognitive ability is also affected.  I used to be able to multitask, but now I have to concentrate on one thing at a time.  I am sensitive to loud noises, so even a supermarket visit can be stressful.  Stress tends to worsen my symptoms.<\/p><p> At the moment, I am said to be in the honeymoon stage of the disease.  The medication helps, but it does not slow the progression.  Exercise is the only known method that helps slow the progression.  Advanced Parkinson's can lead to more involuntary movements, and people find it more difficult to move - even to turn in bed.  Freezing of gait is another symptom of advanced Parkinson's, which means that your feet feel stuck to the ground and you cannot move forward.<\/p><p> Parkinson's is a very misunderstood condition.  There are so many symptoms, and the condition affects everyone differently.  I applied for a medical card, but I was turned down because my husband was still working.  I would like to outline roughly the cost of an average week.  Exercise classes cost &euro;30, alternative therapies cost &euro;65, supplements cost &euro;12.50 and travel costs to attend therapies or classes amount to &euro;25.  That comes to a total of &euro;132.50.  My social welfare payment is &euro;208.50, which leaves me with &euro;76.00 after paying for the above.  If I need to visit to my GP, it costs &euro;55, which is an extra for that week.  The social welfare payment needs to be increased and a medical card granted, especially as there are some services that are only accessible if you have a medical card.<\/p><p> There are many functions that are affected by Parkinson's.   I noticed that my voice had become very low and I was starting to leave social events early as people could not hear me.  I eventually got on to a programme called LSVT Loud.  It has really helped me and I now have the skills to help keep my voice strong for as long as possible.  In County Wexford, I do not have access to the care of a Parkinson's nurse.  I see my consultant once a year, but I do have questions in between those visits.  Parkinson's is a complex condition that affects everyone differently.  Therefore, one size does not fit all.<\/p><p> We are not getting the care we need to help manage this disease.  We should be given a care plan on the day of diagnosis that includes physiotherapy, nutrition advice and voice and occupational therapy.  We also need counselling to deal with the shock and ongoing challenges.  Early intervention with a multidisciplinary approach is essential to live well with Parkinson's.  It would be of huge benefit if we could attend a centre for a week of intensive therapies and assessment and be able to return again after two years for reassessment.  This would help monitor the progression of the disease, as per Articles 10 and 26 of the UNCRPD on the right to life and habilitation and rehabilitation, respectively.<\/p><p> Parkinson's is one of the fastest-growing neurological diseases.  The incidence of Parkinson's is expected to double by 2030.  I am pleading with the Government to act now and to put in place the services necessary to help us live well with Parkinson's.  The provision of early intervention and community-based programmes would be money well spent and would take the pressure off the hospital system.  People need to have access to ongoing exercise programmes nationwide incorporating balance work to help prevent falls, which can result in fractures and hospitalisation.  I ask the Government to ensure that we are not the forgotten people with this disability.  We have families that care about us and this disease affects their lives also.  I am still the same person as I was before my diagnosis.  I ask others to please see me, and not the disability, as per Article 17 of the UNCRPD on protecting the integrity of the person.

They referred to a wide range of issues.  I thank them for their time and knowledge.  It has been really informative and also personal.<\/p> <p>  There are three main areas that I want to ask questions on, but first, I wish to mention several things that struck me in listening to the witnesses.  I have been working with a local diabetes advocacy group, Midwest Diabetes Advocacy.  Members of the group have been enlightening me as to the geographical lottery that exists even in terms of diabetes.  There is an intervention and education programme, Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating, DAFNE, that is not available in University Hospital Limerick, for example, which means that people in counties Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary are the only people in the country that do not have access to this incredibly helpful programme.<\/p> <p>  Ms Ulpe told us that there is not one official ME consultant in the State, which is quite unbelievable.  ME is not a new condition.  I find it concerning that across the whole of the HSE, there is no specialist.  Ms McGreehan mentioned that 50 years down the line, lupus still does appear on the long-term illness list.  In respect of Parkinson's, I know that there are only three neurologists when there should be 11.  This shortfall of eight massively impacts on access to services across the mid-west region.  Can any of the witnesses speak to their experiences of that geographic discrepancy, or instances of consultants with a specific area of expertise only working from hospitals that are a great distance away?  Is it fair to say that every witness has experienced this lack of access to expertise in their regions?<\/p> <p>  The theme of financial hardship was echoed across all of the witnesses' statements.  It is incredulous that not only is there no costed disability payment, but that other essential payments, such as the mobility grant, have been cut in austerity times and have never been restored.  I love the idea that assistive technology grants will be given directly to the individual and not to the employers.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on what the main asks should be in terms of lessening the financial burden on people with chronic illnesses.  Should we be calling for a costed disability payment that is tailored to the specific needs of each individual, or is it better to campaign for each separate payment, for example, assistive technology, mobility grants, etc.?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I wish to ask each of the witness about personal assistant services.  I find it interesting that such services were not referenced in any of the opening statements.  I am wondering if any of the witnesses have had access to a personal assistant.  Does it come back to the issue of the hierarchy of disability, and as mentioned by one of the witnesses, not being disabled enough?  Is a personal assistance service something that would assist the witnesses to live their lives in a more supported way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#D00300","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I want to comment on the cost of disability payment, which absolutely should be made available.

I cannot go to a shop to buy groceries.  I have to have them delivered, so I have to use the online services.  If my computer breaks down, I do not know how I will survive because I am totally reliant on it for everything.  Obviously, I would not be here and have a voice today if I did not have a computer.  That definitely needs to be included.<\/p> <p>  On the personal assistant services, I did not mention it because I do not have personal experience of applying for that, but I know many people in the ME community who have struggled to get this in place because ME is not considered a disability according to the HSE.  Some people managed to get home help anyway, but I am also aware of several people my age who have been forced to move into nursing homes because they cannot access appropriate home help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna-Karin Ulpe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>With regard to access to consultants in regional areas, I was speaking yesterday to a young mum whose child was sick and she had her appointment in Dublin, 80 km away.  The child got sick and they had to turn around and go back, which means she has to wait another nine months for an appointment.  Had the neurologist been closer to her, she would have been able to travel herself but, with Parkinson's, people&rsquo;s energy levels for the day are a bit like money, and they have to spend it wisely.  She would not have enough energy to drive to Dublin, have the appointment and get back on her own.  That is why we need more neurologists in the regions.<\/p> <p>  On personal assistants, there are definitely cases where people with Parkinson's just do not have the energy to get up, get dressed and drive to appointments.  If they live in a rural area, they would have to drive for half an hour, 40 minutes or an hour to an appointment, do their therapy, or whatever it is, and then drive back home, which is just not possible.

The reason I have stayed here is that my daughter has severe allergies and we have often ended up in hospital with her due to anaphylaxis.  I live very close to hospitals but it takes so much energy to go to appointments all the time, even before I had long Covid, and EDS involves an element of fatigue.  As Ms Casserly said, there is the spoon theory with regard to chronic illness in that we have a certain number of spoons and we can only use them to do a certain number of things.  When people have to drive to all of these specialists and doctors that they are paying through the nose for because they cannot wait for the public system, it is all skewed towards Dublin.

I tried to do it differently and things did not happen, and by that I mean that I tried to do it locally and things did not work out for me.  I am exhausted after my day in Dublin, and that is it.  I have to forget about everything else because nothing else is done for the rest of the day, or probably the rest of the week, because I am so exhausted.<\/p> <p>  On the question of personal assistants, I think that I am so independent that I do not need a personal assistant, and that I am not going to be that person.  I have never even thought I would be entitled to this, so I have never looked into whether I would be able to get a personal assistant.  We live in rural Ireland, away from my family, and there is no bus except the school bus, which passes my door although I am not allowed to use it.<\/p> <p>  There are so many obstacles.  I mentioned assistive technology, which would make things much easier.  It would mean I am able to be independent and to walk around the streets of Dublin or to go to the hospital without having to ask.  In some hospitals, I have noticed that the signs are positioned way up so some people cannot see them.  I have been laughed at and people say, &ldquo;Oh yes, the last porter was really tall.&rdquo;  Things like that are crazy in this day and age.  There are so many simple things that could make people's lives a bit easier.  It is also about the knowledge on whether people are entitled to supports and where to go for them.

We want to try to identify the many challenges they have in terms of living their daily lives and see what recommendations we can put forward to try to help to support them.  Today&rsquo;s meeting is very useful in terms of shining a light on the invisible disabilities that are not all too obvious, and getting more information on the background of how the medical world treats them and how society treats them, as well as looking at the stigma and discrimination that most definitely is impacting daily on all of them.<\/p> <p>  There are a few common threads.  The lack of effective communication between primary and secondary care is cited as a big barrier and is hugely important.  There is also the fact chronic disease management is currently hospital-based as opposed to community-based.

In regard to my eyes, because I was on medication for a long time, the retina was burned out of the back of my eye.  It is very rare that that happens.  One has more chance of winning the lottery.

I am in a better position that other people because I live in Dublin.  During most of my illness, I have not been able to use public transport because I cannot not sit upright for too long.  During my journey to finding my final and good consultant, I saw ten health professionals.  As I could not sit for too long in waiting rooms, I brought my yoga mat with me to lie on so that I would not faint before I was seen.  When I rolled it out on the floor, I was told that for health and safety reasons I was not allowed to lie down.  Nobody ever thinks that people might be so sick they need to lie down in a waiting room if waiting for an hour.  This is the first hurdle that must be overcome.  It would be so easy to provide a space where people can lie down.<\/p> <p>  The person who cannot drive or access public transport should be able to access health care through home visits otherwise they are just being left to rot.  It is important services are provided close to the person in the community.

I have noticed that a lot of seating has been removed in our urban areas and villages.  Two weeks ago, I went to a private shopping centre in a nearby village.  There are no seats there, apart from in the caf&eacute;s.  For people with mobility issues and people who get fatigued, it is really important that we make our villages and towns more friendly.  Currently, these places are very hostile in that there is nowhere to sit down and rest.  It is seen as inciting antisocial behaviour.  That is at the expense of people who really need to take a little breather.  Access to toilets is also an issue.  I noticed during the pandemic that there are very few, if any, public toilets.

Ms Casserly mentioned that a number of years ago, all of a sudden, as a young woman she was faced with Parkinson's, wondering how she was going to cope with that and tell her family about it and that she also had to give up work, etc.  It has been life-changing.  I do not wish to be despondent, but what I am hearing is that she is left in a void, that she has to start at base level as if she is in junior infants and only beginning to get on with life from hereon in, but the supports are just not there and there is no pathway.  This comes through in other areas such as, for example, when a child first receives a diagnosis of autism.  The parents have to first cope with that and then find out where to go, what to do and so on.  What is lacking is a type of case-worker who will take on the person or family and point them on the pathway in terms of services, contacts and how they are co-ordinated.  There is a huge gap in that co-ordination for anybody with disabilities, be that an acquired disability or one the person was born with.<\/p> <p>  An issue regularly raised with me, and with this committee by witnesses, is that of entitlements, in particular the medical card.  There should be no question that anybody with a disability should be entitled to a medical card irrespective of income.  That should be a given.  I know of amputees, some of whom have appeared as witnesses before this committee, who cannot get a medical card.  Even though the cost of replacement of an artificial leg is &euro;20,000 and that might need to be done every two or three years, in the cases raised with me these people cannot get a medical card or access funding.  The lived experiences of the witnesses are important to us as policymakers and legislators.  They have articulated those experiences well today.  It is important to note that the mobility grant was withdrawn and that ten years later it still has not been replaced.  That is a huge issue.  Anybody trying to get a primary medical certificate will know only too well the difficulties that arise in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I come from east Galway where, when people are refused a medical certificate and they have to go for an assessment, they are offered an appeal in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It might be an enormous challenge for them to get to D&uacute;n Laoghaire for the appeal because they may not be fit to travel to Dublin, which is a 2.5 hour journey each way.  We do have other clinics, such as the clinic in Roscommon, which I last visited three or four years ago.  That is the type of problem people are facing.<\/p><p> There is something that galls more than anything else.  I have come across a number of cases of it.  One man getting disability payment got married.  His wife is working.  His disability allowance has been cut to about &euro;50 a week because his wife's means are taken into account.  I have met the couple.  It is demoralising for him.  He says had he known this would happen, they would not have got married but would have lived in sin.  He smiles when he says that, but he is very upset that he is being penalised because he got married.<\/p><p> Housing adaptation grants were mentioned.  There is a problem because the local authorities do great work on this but they are given an amount of funding, and they make a contribution towards the cost but they do not cover it.  Then, when they assess how much they will pay, they must look at all income coming into the house.  If a son or daughter is living in the house because they cannot afford to rent, and they are working, their income must be taken into account and that might push someone over the threshold where they will not get even 10% of the cost of the adaptations.  We have a lot of work to do.<\/p><p> I do not necessarily have questions for the witnesses, but I want to echo what we get from others.  I commend the witnesses on their forthright contributions.  The committee is working hard and is united.  We are doing that because every one of us on the committee wants to be on it.  We volunteered to be on the committee to try and make a difference.  With the witnesses help and continued engagement we will do that.  I thank the witnesses and apologise because I must go to the Business Committee meeting at 11 a.m.  If I leave, I am not being disrespectful.  It is just that I have to be elsewhere.

We need information appropriate to the right age group.<\/p> <p>  On medical cards, it is terrible that we are depending on our partners to support us.  I am mindful that I am lucky to have a partner.  There are people living on their own depending on the social welfare payment.

It is a very vulnerable experience for the witnesses but it is very much appreciated.  We really value it.<\/p> <p>  If I were to look for a trend across all the contributions, it would be cost and a lack of joined-up thinking.  It is shocking that the list has not been updated since 1972 given how far medical science and diagnosis and so on has come on in 50 years.  I will give out about that in the Seanad later.  There will be chronic illnesses that we might not have the specialism or that has not yet evolved or it is newly diagnosed or new thinking.  However, there is a formula of using an multidisciplinary approach.  I am not a medical person and am learning on my feet in the Oireachtas.  However, the organiser in me would draw up a spider diagram and consider the A to Z of issues.  Having a template of considerations for novel illnesses should not be beyond the abilities of people in the HSE.  I fail to understand why that has not been done and why there is not a formula in central office for newly emerging illnesses.  Take long Covid.  While we are learning on our feet, literally, and it is new, there should be a formula that we are able to apply.  The common theme I hear from everyone is the idea that an illness comes forward and there is no adequate response.  It is up to the person who is grappling with the consequences of living with that illness to find out all the solutions for themselves.  The concept of a one-stop-shop or office that could be set up to provide that information and orchestrates co-ordinated thinking should be feasible.  I really do not understand that.<\/p><p> I know that each of the witnesses are here as individuals rather than representative organisations but are there organisations that support their particular illnesses?  I know in the case of Parkinson's disease there is.  Do we have any idea of numbers?  When we are talking to gurus in Departments, it is useful sometimes to turn around and quantify and say this is how many people there are.  It further exacerbates the shameful lack of thinking by being able to quantify.  One person is enough for us to have an adequate response as a State.  I am not trying to minimise it in any way.  I am just saying it gives us an idea.  I think I have covered it all.  I have not gone anywhere near the remotest outrage I felt when I was reading the witnesses' statements but I think from that perspective, those are the sorts of things.  On that medical card issue and the lack of not being disabled enough, I have a very close supporter who equally is an amputee and has never qualified.

I constantly feel like we renters in the private sector are forgotten about.  We may have an income that would have been adequate if we lived in social housing or if we had a long-term mortgage but with the current market rent, we are very often left with less after rent is paid than the supplementary welfare allowance.  We are, therefore, the poorest percentile in Ireland and yet for some things, we cannot get help.  We do not qualify.  That is extremely frustrating.<\/p> <p>  I can tell the Senator about the numbers of people with ME in Ireland.   It should be approximately 10,000 to 19,000 people but it is really hard to estimate because so many people are undiagnosed as a result of lacking consultants and because so many people cannot travel to care or consultants abroad.  They are really stuck in that sense.  There is a very good organisation called ME Advocates Ireland, MEAI.  It has a survey under way that will be handed over to the HSE when the data is collated and interpreted, and probably to the Department of Health as well.

They need to be in clear English and not everybody in Ireland has English as a first language.  It is not only about the language in the forms, it is also about the tone.  There is almost a sense of entitlement levelled at people.  It is as if they are asking for something they should not have asked for.

She rightly encouraged the Government to be proactive and invest in early intervention and community-based programmes now, which would be better for individuals and health services.  Could Ms Casserly describe what kind of programmes she would have in mind or what would be useful?<\/p> <p>  Ms McGreehan highlighted that the mobility grant was stopped for new applicants in 2013.  A new scheme was due to replace it but nothing has materialised yet.  This is an issue that many of us will be aware of from our constituency work.  Could Ms McGreehan elaborate on the significance of this grant and why it needs to be reinstated immediately.  She points out that in some cases individuals have to use their annual leave for medical appointments.  Given that some conditions require multiple appointments with different healthcare professionals, this is an indication of the reality of living with a chronic illness and of Ireland's poor worker rights.  Does Ms Casserly think there should be a statutory right to take necessary medical appointments without affecting annual leave?  If there is time I will have a question for Ms Wehrly at the end as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#J00600","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>On the multidisciplinary approach, what is needed first is an assessment for physiotherapy in order to see what one needs to do to manage this condition.  I did not realise how important exercise was and now there is research and education on that.  Years ago people were probably told to go home and sit down and that is the worst thing one could do for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  Some people think that walking alone is enough, but it is not.  There needs to be a wider range of movements in exercise programmes for functions such as getting out of the chair, twisting and turning.  Education is needed around that physiotherapy.  Community-based exercise programmes specifically for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease would help to prevent falls and would also have a social element that would connect people.  Speech therapy is also so important.  Once you start to lose your speech it is hard to get it back so specific speech therapy is needed.  There is a programme called LSVT Loud, which is specifically for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and everybody should be put onto that programme straight away and they would learn the skills necessary to maintain their voices as they journey through this condition.<\/p> <p>  Counselling is also important.  People are shocked when they get their diagnoses.  One could be in the workplace and at the height of one&rsquo;s career or one could be the main earner in the house and suddenly one might have to give up work.  One might have children to put through college and expenses such as a mortgage and it is hard to cope and manage.  Anxiety, stress and depression can be symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease as well so counselling is overlooked in helping to cope with the disease.  There is also occupational therapy and assisted technology.  I want to touch on information for employers.  If a worker goes to an employer and says that he or she has this condition, we must give the employer the skills to know what to do, what to say and how to help the worker.  I know that is getting away from the community question but it is something I wanted to mention to the committee.  We need more community involvement and the Sl&aacute;intecare programme seems to have the right approach in that regard.  People need to be kept away from the hospital system for as long as possible and they need to be given the skills to cope with this condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Casserly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I did not mention the mobility grants being stopped for new entrants in 2013.

Private sector employers can access grants on behalf of their employees.  It would be great if there was a national register of people who had chronic illnesses and a statutory entitlement to a day off to go to the doctor.  I would probably have ten hospital appointments in Dublin.  Taking ten days out of people's annual leave entitlement is a lot when they are exhausted.  It is not fair on their partners because they want to go away for a couple of days but they are constantly in the car driving to Dublin.  People go up to Dublin and are not even fit to go for a walk around St. Stephen's Green and smell the coffee.  These issues are very important.  I would like a national register of people with chronic diseases.  Employers are afraid that people will take advantage of statutory days.  The fear in some organisations is that people would get one up on the employer.  We are not trying to get one up on anybody.  We just want to live and work.

It is crucial.  Longing to be heard is a big thing.  I saw ten different consultants over five years to try to get a diagnosis.  It is so crushing to receive disbelief, hear people saying there is nothing wrong and that the only problem is that people are fat.  I have been told this.  I heard that I was lazy for getting my own wheelchair.  I have been gaslighted so much that it is a wonder I am still alive today, to be honest.  We have to be so strong not to disintegrate completely from all of this.  The big thing to change is education.  Everyone in the health service should be educated about ME, as should everybody working with disability and social care, so they recognise how ill and how disabled we are and how many accommodations we need to access basic healthcare.  Getting this recognition would mean so much.<\/p> <p>  I will tell the committee what happened when I saw the first consultant who understood my illness and who listened to me.  I was a beautiful May day, with flowering fruit trees all around.  It felt like I had come to paradise because I was seen.  I cried with relief in the car all they way back from Tullamore that day.  It was a cathartic experience that finally somebody believed me and saw me and that now my journey to get help could begin.  He helped me with all of the paperwork for housing.  He got me medication.  Everything started then.  Five years of my life were gone totally, which made me worse.  Now I cannot do much but before all this started I had begun to get a little bit better.  I was able to do a little bit of light yoga and have more of a social life.

She asked about raising awareness.  I spent many years thinking I had fibromyalgia and going to different physiotherapists.  Like Ms Ulpe, when I eventually got my diagnosis, it was a relief to know I was not going mad and to have an answer as to what was wrong with me.  There needs to be more awareness raising around disabilities and the fact that some of them are hidden.  I sometimes feel we are like swans, looking calm on top but with hell going on at times underneath.<\/p> <p>  Financial assistance is an issue I want to highlight.  Some people find it very stressful to fill out the forms, and stress and Parkinson's disease do not go well together.  Why make it so complicated when people are in genuine need?  In the case of housing adaptation grants, for example, it can take more than a year for people to get funding to make their home more suitable for them.  Parkinson's disease is a progressive condition that is not going to go away any time soon.  We are praying for a cure but there is none at the moment.  Why put people trough so much stress and turmoil?  A woman I know has an upstairs bathroom and has to get in the bathtub to have a shower.  She lives on her own and could fall.  We are hearing those sorts of things every day.  Why make it so hard for people?  Fighting for help is putting stress on people who are already coping with this condition.  I do not think it is fair.<\/p> <p>  We need to have services and therapies available locally and we need more neurologists and nurses who specialise in Parkinson's disease.  We need to have that care in between our yearly appointments.  People go on medication, have side effects and are left wondering what is normal and if the side effects will calm down.  Parkinson's disease is complex and we need to have a backup system whereby people can pick up the telephone and ask somebody what they should do, including whether they should tweak their medication, take it at different times or whatever else.  We need that information but, unfortunately, it is not there at the moment.

With something like ADHD, it can take up to 60 years for people to get a diagnosis, especially women because they present quite differently from men.  We are used to masking in society as it is, getting on with it and putting a brave face on things.  I got fobbed off by GPs for many years in trying to access an ADHD diagnosis because it was kind of seen as some faddy American thing.  I was told, \"Sure, you do not need that; you look fine.\"  With EDS as well, there is definitely an element of medical gaslighting because people are presenting with all these random, chronic issues that are not acute.  You are not at death's door but there are niggly things that kind of are fine but kind of not.  You are in and out to the GP all the time.<\/p> <p>  If I were to ask for three actions that would help, the first would be to have a register or database, as discussed earlier, from which people can take statistics as to who has what in this country.  If we are not being measured, there is no way of knowing how we are progressing.  It seems like a baseline requirement to have a register.  Second, GPs are usually our first port of call and they are amazing, but their knowledge relates to general practice.  With EDS, we call ourselves zebras because a zebra is the emblem of rare diseases.  When doctors are in training, the phrase \"Hear hooves, think horses\" is often used because, generally, one should not assume somebody has the rarest disease because that is statistically unlikely.  By and large, because of that, the exceptions, like us, may fall through the cracks.  It would be helpful if GP knowledge were updated every so often.  I find medical knowledge of EDS and ADHD has really increased in the past while.  In the case of long Covid, however, I am still seeing people in the support groups whose GPs are dismissing them or who have had no access to apply to long Covid clinics because the GP is not paying to attention to information on it or may not even believe in it.<\/p> <p>  The third action would be around localised access.  Obviously, it is not suitable for everybody but our health centres could be a really good resource.  I know from personal experience that staffing is a huge issue but it would be great for people to be able to go to their public health nurse rather than having to book lots of doctors appointments when, for example, they want to check side effects of medicine and link in on a continuing basis.  It can be exhausting for us to clog up the system and drain it for everyone else.  There has to be an easier way to streamline things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Olga Wehrly"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank all the contributors.  The discussion has been a real education and something of an eye-opener for me, particularly when it comes to ME and Parkinson's disease.  I was not aware how widespread they are and how difficult it is to measure their incidence.  That is a real failing and flaw within our health service.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Ms Ulpe's contribution, it is very disheartening to hear how difficult it was for her to get a diagnosis.  It is simply not right.  She described as crushing the challenge of the diagnosis and of not having the high-level medical consultants available who specialise in these areas.  It must cause many challenges within the health service.  I support what Senator Seery Kearney said about accepting the letter and getting the committee to act on that.  That would be a really strong statement and I am happy to be part of it.<\/p> <p>  Ms Casserly spoke about her experience with Parkinson's disease as feeling like she is a swan.  As somebody who has had to navigate through the service, who was an unlikely candidate for the disease and who, because of her age group, did not have access to naturally occurring peer-to-peer mentoring, I am delighted she is getting help now and that those groups have provided so much support.  Both Ms Casserly and Ms Ulpe spoke about the need for a database of organisations and, even more importantly, a database or register of patients.  To use Ms Wehrly's word, that really needs to be streamlined.  I think this committee can put pressure on the HSE to provide the resources to make it happen.<\/p> <p>  The need for a database of patients leads on to what Ms McGreehan spoke about as somebody who is working and making a huge contribution to the economy as well as battling many other challenges.  Without additional leave, going up and down to Dublin or wherever else is putting people like her and Ms Wehrly under a lot of pressure.  Action in that regard sounds very doable and it needs to happen hand in hand with the setting up of a register of patients.  It should be relatively easy on an administrative level to make that happen if the will is there, and the budget, to do it.  My question to the witnesses is what that would that look like in terms of the amount of leave - specifically, the number of days - that would suffice to start with and how that leave might be drawn down.<\/p> <p>  Ms Wehrly referred to housing adaptation grants.  I would be really interested to hear how she thinks we could help with that barrier.  If, for instance, we were to make the adaptation grant available to renters, does she think there would be buy-in from landlords?  Would such provision be of practical assistance or do we need to think more outside of the box on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021111800002#L00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked how many days of leave people might need.<\/p><p>We might need a register.

It is dependent on my whether my lungs are affected or my eyes or getting worse.  I need different types of treatment.  There has to be a compromise.  I do not want anything for nothing.

I am self-employed but for some jobs, I am on PAYE.  My employment is strange in that I work doing voice-overs and as an actor.  Days off are not really an issue when you are self-employed, unfortunately.  The days off are the days on which you are looking for work.  There is another issue that has not been raised yet, but I think we can all relate to it.  I find that in the workplace I am trying to come off as not having anything wrong because I do not want to be a burden.  As there is an insurance element to it and I have to fill out an insurance form for every job I do, I want to be insurable.<\/p> <p>  Having had long Covid for the past year, I probably would not have been insurable to be on television or film set because I was experiencing a great deal of vertigo and other significant things.  On the issue of days off and annual leave, I do not know it is works in that respect for somebody in my position.  In terms of renting and rental accommodation, it is the broader issue of having insecure housing and relying on a private rental market.  If we are relying on hyper-inflated markets and the housing assistance payment scheme which, at best, is dysfunctional, it is a precarious system.  If one could find an amenable landlord, who would allow one to put rails in a bathroom and so on, it is not a long-term solution because the housing in itself is not a long-term solution.  It is about bringing it back to the basics.  We need housing, shelter and employment, all of which are core things.  Days off and grants for adaptation are amazing but they need to be tied into something that is more suitable for our needs as a whole.

I asked the landlord if I could store it in the lobby where buggies were being stored - it was a big enough area such that nobody was falling over them.  He stated that for health and safety reasons the wheelchair would be a fire hazard.  I had to store it outside.  I was lucky that it was not stolen, but it rusted.  When you rent privately, you have few rights.  It is you against the landlord.

Were it not for our lovely neighbours, we would not have been able to move.  They moved everything for us.  My partner was still formally employed at this point and we were able to secure a new contract for the place we live in now.  We were lucky in that nobody asked us for a P60.  If that had happened, we would have been screwed and homeless.  This type of stress makes my condition much worse.  It should not happen.  That is my comment in regard to private renting.<\/p> <p>  On the list of disabled persons, my concern is who would administer it?  My GP refused to put me on the list of vulnerable persons, which I had asked him to do in order that I could get the Covid jab earlier.  My GP said that because I was not immunocompromised, I was not at increased risk of getting sick.  To be honest, I could not see myself surviving Covid.  I already have so little energy that I feel like I am dying, so I would not even have the energy to cough.  Covid would finish me off, definitely, but that is not recognised.  If we could self-report, we could then, at least, put up our hands and say how many people fulfil the international consensus criteria for ME.  The HSE would have to decide the international criteria for diagnosis it would want to use, because there is, as yet, no diagnostic test.  The international consensus criteria would be a good idea.  If we had self-reporting, this register would provide us with a fairly accurate picture of how many people are suffering.

I should point out that many people are afraid to tell their employers they have Parkinson's disease for fear or losing their jobs or not being treated equally.  It is a big issue at times.  How do people tell their employers?  It is a risk some people are worried about taking.  There may be stress in that and of maybe trying to hide the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as a tremor, making it even worse.

Many of the witnesses spoke about data on chronic disease.  We have heard at various meetings about the lack of data on disability.  It is mind-boggling think how there can be any proper planning without such data.  That is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  I find it unbelievable there is no diagnostic test for ME at this stage.  I know people who have had ME for 20 years or more.  It is amazing there is no proper diagnostic test at this stage and people are basically treated in a dismissive fashion, being told they are okay or look fine so they should go ahead and work and so on.  Is much research being done on all the diseases or illnesses mentioned by the witnesses?<\/p> <p>  The cost of disability is coming up time and again and we hear it from everybody.  It seems there is an assumption that people can survive on a payment of &euro;200 per week or that they have a medical card covering GP and doctor visits, along with medication.  As the witnesses pointed out, many other supports are needed, including assistive technology, physiotherapy, exercise classes or nutrition advice.  None of that seems to be covered and it is not taken into account.  That must be highlighted on a continuous basis to ensure it can be taken into account.<\/p> <p>  There is also bureaucracy around form filling and it affects so many people, no matter what payment people are applying for.  It applies if they are applying for social housing or any sort of social welfare payment.  The forms are so long and difficult and they must be put in simpler language and made easier for people to complete.  They should be available in different languages to ensure that everybody can understand what they are applying for.  So many people do not know what they are entitled to or what they should apply for.  I spoke with a woman whose son had an intellectual disability.  She did not know she could apply for the domiciliary care allowance.  She had never applied for it in the full 16 years it was available.  She should not have to know it and she should have been informed by the district nurse or whoever at the time that she had certain entitlements.  There must be an easier way of informing people of what are their entitlements or what supports are available without somebody having to ask, look or rely on others, such as the peer support that we have heard about as being so important to direct people in a certain way and make them aware of what supports are available.

My brain is too slow to explain what it is trying to do but it is something the researchers can see in blood.  It looks like they are close to finding it.  Of course, it would be great if governments could chip in and help fund this because keeping us sick is also a cost.<\/p> <p>  I do not know for sure if Ireland funds any biomedical research for ME but I would be surprised if that was the case.

Amendment 158 introduces section 653AM to deal with situations where nobody has come forward as the owner of a site that is within the scope of this tax.  This measure provides that where the owner of such a site does not register with Revenue the site may become the property of the State.  If an owner has registered with Revenue, Revenue will use its normal collection mechanisms to collect the tax and interest due.  This provision only applies where no owner has been identified.  It will only apply where the tax and interest owing and charged on the land exceeds 110% of the market value of the site.  Once the amount of unpaid tax and interest exceeds 110% of the market value, the first step is that Revenue will place a notice in<i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>setting out that this process is commencing.  After six months, if nobody has come forward and registered as the owner of the land, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can make an application to the High Court to have the site concerned made property of the State.  The High Court can then make such directions as it thinks are appropriate in relation to publication or otherwise before making the order sought.  While it is envisaged that the Revenue Commissioners will rely on this measure only in limited circumstances, its inclusion is an important tool in targeting non-compliance in circumstances where the tax due on a site within the scope of residential zoned land tax is not paid and the landowner is not forthcoming in meeting its obligations. <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 131 and 133 place two additional requirements on owners of a site where they are making a submission to the local authority on either a draft map or a supplemental map.  These two additional requirements are, first, that the owner's submission includes a map from Ordinance Survey Ireland that clearly identifies the site and, second, the owner may be asked to provide evidence of ownership to the local authority.  Both of these additional requirements are necessary to ensure that the appeals procedure, where a landowner can appeal a decision of the local authority, can operate as intended. <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 160 and 161 seek to provide for reports in regard to the RZLT.  On amendment No. 160, the Deputies may note that in setting the initial rate for this tax great care needs to be taken to get the balance right between it achieving its essential purpose of encouraging the release of land for home building purposes, but at the same time not being too penal that it runs the risk of being challenged in the courts.  If I were to apply a rate of 25% from the outset, it would change significantly the economics of making a return on capital invested in the land as a business asset and this could make the business model unviable, which would be counterproductive and damaging to the goal of meeting our house building objectives over the next number of years.  It is important to see how the tax operates and to then make an assessment as to whether it is working.  If it is not leading to an increase in land being released for housing purposes, I will have no hesitation in reviewing the rate, if I deem it likely that this will help the situation.  In summary, I believe the 3% rate is an appropriate rate to apply when this tax comes into force in two years' time, as I am of the view it will encourage landowners to either develop their land or sell it to others for development purposes.  In doing this, the supply of land available will increase.  This should be reflected in a stabilisation of land prices.  It is for this purpose, I cannot agree to the amendment seeking this report.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 161 and the Deputies' wish that I produce a report estimating the likely financial impact of the exclusions, exemptions, deferrals and abatements from the residential zoned land tax contained in this section with a view to removing any or all of them before the tax comes into effect my views are as follows.  In order for this tax to be effective it is necessary that there be exclusions, including, among other things, residential dwellings and their gardens, certain infrastructure or facilities including utilities, transport, and facilitates for social, community or recreational purposes, business premises in areas zoned for mixed use purposes.  Without these exclusions, we would be taxing land on which there was no possibility of any housing development taking place.  This would make no sense.<\/p><p>In regard to the issue of deferrals, the Deputies should note that these arise only in very specific circumstances such as, first, where a judicial review has been sought by a third party against the decision of a local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to a planning decision.  In my view a deferral is fair in such a situation as the matter is out of the control of the developer.  The second circumstance is in a situation where a person has commenced development of a site.  Since the purpose of the tax is to encourage developers to build on this land, it seems appropriate in my view to suspend the payment of the tax, which continues to accrue, for the duration of the construction period.  Should they meet their delivery commitments, then the tax will not be payable, but failure to do so will result in a proportional payment of the suspended tax for the part not completed.  This approach is aligned with the philosophy behind this tax of encouraging the construction of houses rather than as a revenue raising measure.  For that reason, I cannot agree to this amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#A00600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Minister but we are experiencing some feedback on the system and it is affecting the broadcast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#A00700","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>It may be that somebody's device is not on mute.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#A00800","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I think the interference is gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The remaining amendments are all technical in nature, correcting references and typos and making other minor errors where the legislation, as drafted, did not quite work from a technical perspective.<\/p> <p>  I will be introducing a number of Report Stage amendments which I think at this stage will mainly relate to maps and are likely to be technical in nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>This section in the Finance Bill is larger than many Bills we deal with.

We know the problems with the vacant site levy and we argued with the Government that it should come under the fold of the Revenue.  Notwithstanding that, my question is as follows.  Under the vacant site levy at 7%, the owner of a piece of land that is currently valued at &euro;1 million is currently required to pay &euro;70,000 annually.  Under the provisions of this section of the Bill, that will no longer be the case.  How much will the owner now pay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>If it is worth &euro;1 million, the owner will be paying &euro;30,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>That site is currently being charged &euro;70,000 to try to encourage its development or sale for development purposes and yet there is a reduction here.  That is the concern.  The vacant site levy was raised from 3% to 7%.  There are many more issues with the vacant site levy regarding collection, implementation, local authorities and all that.  The rate was also raised because at 3% on a piece of land worth &euro;1 million, the &euro;30,000 that was being charged was not working and so it was increased to &euro;70,000.  Given the lead-in time for this tax, surely it should be considered at a higher rate.  My view is that it is not penal to have it at a 7% rate because others, including some in Government parties, have called for the vacant site levy to be significantly increased.  There is a very long lead-in period meaning that people who have vacant sites will know that this is coming down the line within a number of years, giving them the opportunity to act.<\/p> <p>  With that in mind, why does the Minister believe reducing the tax required to be paid on those sites will encourage the owners to develop them, given that they will be paying less than half of what they are currently paying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#B00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":397,"content":"<p>It is because of the difference in scale of the tax.

My recollection is that it applies to several hundred properties.  Our estimate is that the zoned land tax will cover approximately 8,000 ha to 9,000 ha.  Therefore, it will be 16 to 18 times bigger than the current tax.  Whereas the current vacant site levy is one with which very few landowners interface, the residential zoned land tax will become a core part of how land is taxed if homes are not being built on it.

This is not the time to be thinking about the poor craturs who are hoarding land in the middle of our towns and cities.  This is a time to say, \"Use it or we penalise you because you have had enough time.\"  We have been in the middle of a housing emergency for a while.<\/p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will respond to that but let me put my other questions in the interests of time.  They are just technical questions.  Chapter 2 concerns zoned serviced residential land and applies to land \"solely or primarily for residential use, or \"for a mixture of uses, including residential use\".  We will have a situation where active farm land, which has a mixed-use purpose, will also be zoned for residential use because part of the farm is close to the town centre.  How does that work?  Is it the case that farmers will have to apply for it to be dezoned and so on?  Has there been consideration of the implications of how that will impact on agriculture?  If farmers are going to go and get land dezoned to solely agricultural land, is there is a process in place for them?  Are there any knock-on impacts on farmers being able to raise loans and so on and so forth in terms of land that will be devalued, even though they are using it for farming?<\/p> <p>  What happens to land subject to this tax, that is in scope and part of the final map, which is sold during the process, since the tax kicks in after a period?  How will the reasonable test outlined under the proposed section 653B(b), which is that the land is serviced or has access to services, operate?  My final question on this chapter is about Revenue's ability to engage.  I do not have the section in front of me but I am sure the Minister's officials will know it.  Revenue has the ability to point out to a local authority a site that was not included in earlier maps.  The local authority then has to make that provision in its final map.  That is fine if it is the middle of this process, which is that the local authority draws up a draft map, it goes to consultation and landowners are able to write in and make submissions or whatever.  For the subsequent map, Revenue, in the middle of that process, can point out a site that was omitted and, therefore, the local authority has to include it in the final map.  What if that omission is identified after the final map is published?  If I am correct, local authorities have to publish their new maps every five years.  Can those be captured within the five-year period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#C01600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I will deal with each question in turn.  In the case of the agricultural use of land zoned for residential purposes, the options will be to pay the tax, build homes on the land or change its zoning status.  One of the key reasons we need a run-in period for this is that a dezoning or rezoning process will be put in place by local authorities to allow, for example, a farmer actively farming land zoned for residential use to apply to change the zoning status of that land.

To be very explicit about that point, because it was an important reminder from my colleague, a landowner will have the right to appeal the zoning status of the land.<\/p><p>It would then be open to the local authority to make a final view on that.

We are looking for a report on the vacant property tax.  The Government's Housing for All plan kicks the can down the road for another year on vacant property tax.  At the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in September, Department of Finance officials cited analysis by GeoDirectory which showed that in quarter 2 of 2021, there was 92,000 vacant properties.  Some 4.5% of homes lay vacant in June of this year.  Research shows we have the tenth highest vacancy rate in the world, which is a national scandal.  Dereliction and allowing properties to lie empty is an act of vandalism against the public good.  It can be seen in this city where apartments lie empty and in other areas where there is significant pressure in terms of housing need.<\/p> <p>  We were calling for a vacant property tax in 2016, as another lever that could be introduced to end the scourge of dereliction.  It has not been brought forward by the Government.  In 2017, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, argued for it in the context of that year's budget.  That was four years ago.  The Housing for All plan was published in September 2021, without any firm commitment to introducing a vacant property tax to penalise those who would allow residential properties to remain idle and unused.  It has committed to a data collection exercise.<\/p> <p>  The Minister and the committee will be familiar with my raising the issue of the need for a local property tax on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in 2018.  In response, the Minister cited the Indecon report from September 2018 arguing against its introduction.  Can the Minister now confirm he rejects the conclusions of that report?  Can he now confirm he does support the introduction of a vacant property tax?  Can he explain to the committee why he has not decided to introduce a vacant property tax in each of the past five years in which we have been calling for him to commit to one?  I ask the Minister to expedite the introduction of the vacant property tax without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#F03600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 162 and 164 would require the Minister for Finance to lay a report before the D&aacute;il on the introduction of a vacant residential property tax.  Amendment No. 162 would require that such a report be laid before the Houses within one month of the enactment of the Finance Bill, while Deputy Doherty seeks a report within six months of the passing of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I have stated that the primary objective of any vacant residential property tax would be to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand.  However, before introducing such a tax, it is vital to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties and the reasons they are vacant. This is the reason the housing for all strategy includes an action for my Department to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax.<\/p> <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 has accordingly enabled Revenue to collect certain information on vacant properties in the local property tax, LPT, return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-25.  The extended deadline for submission of returns was Wednesday 10 November.  The information on vacancy in the LPT returns, in respect of approximately 2 million properties, is currently being analysed by Revenue and together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and inform the design of a vacant property tax.<\/p> <p>  It is important to identify the reasons for vacancy and whether this is long or short term in nature.  There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.  Appropriate exemptions from any charge would have to be considered in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy.<\/p> <p>  I want to make it clear that it is my intention to introduce a vacant property tax.  However, the matter needs further consideration and the information Revenue will be collecting will be an input into what we will do, because we will need to come up with a tax which plays a role in encouraging and changing the use of vacant properties.  Once the information from the returns has been collated and drawing on other available information, we will be in a better position to design a vacant property tax and assess its merits and precise design.  As part of Housing for All, I will be treating this matter with the seriousness it deserves and will be looking at the introduction of a vacant residential property tax as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021111800002#F03700","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":554,"content":"<p>When I put this forward in 2018, the Minister rejected the idea of a vacant property tax and he cited the Indecon report which recommended against a vacant property tax.

We very much appreciate the interest which the committee has shown in our work.  My name is Tim Dalton and I was appointed by the two Governments in 2018 as an ICLVR commissioner.  I am accompanied at the meeting by Commissioner Rosalie Flanagan, who was appointed earlier this year, also by the two Governments.  We are joined also by Mr. Geoff Knupfer, the commission's lead forensic scientist and investigator, who was a member of the ICLVR team that met this committee in January 2018.  Mr. Knupfer has, as the need arises, worked with the commission since 2005.  During this time, he has played a central role in all of the commission's work and we are grateful to him for his ready availability and for the skill and expertise he has always brought to the task.  With the Chairman's agreement, both Commissioner Flanagan and Mr. Knupfer will address the committee shortly.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I would like to acknowledge the enormous contribution made to the work of the ICLVR by my predecessor, the late Frank Murray, who most members probably knew, and also by Ms Flanagan's predecessor, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, who has retired as commissioner.  Both men were members of the delegation which met this committee in 2018.<\/p> <p>  As members will know, the commission is one of the reconciliation outcomes of the Good Friday Agreement, which provided that it was essential to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation.  The commission was established on the basis of an intergovernmental agreement between the Irish and British Governments signed in April 1999.  That agreement was then implemented by means of legislation enacted in both jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  One of the key features of our situation legally is that we are an independent and non-political body.  Our task, in a nutshell, is to locate and return to their families the remains of individuals killed and secretly buried by the IRA in the course of the Northern Troubles.  That is broadly between the early 1970s and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.  Our job, as I have mentioned, is simply to search for, hopefully recover and return remains.  It is not our role to comment on other aspects of policy or practice relating to the Troubles.<\/p> <p>  Another key feature of our governing legislation is that it legally guarantees that any information given to us or to our agents in the course of our work must be treated as absolutely confidential and can be used only for the purpose of locating remains.  This is underpinned by provisions rendering information we receive inadmissible in evidence in criminal proceedings and by placing restrictions on the disclosing of information and further restrictions on the forensic testing of human and other remains that may be found.  It is important that persons who might have relevant information but might be reluctant to share it with us should know that this confidentiality rule is there and that it is strictly observed at all times since we were established.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we are happy to report the continuing support and co-operation of both Governments and of the police services on both sides, the contribution of the Department of Justice and Northern Ireland Office, NIO, personnel, the contribution of various experts and contractors we have engaged as needed over the years and the co-operation of people within the republican community who have guided us towards relevant information sources.  Mr. Knupfer will speak about the cases that have been successfully concluded and those that yet remain to be finalised.<\/p> <p>  The story of the disappeared is one of the most tragic of the Troubles and we are honoured to have the opportunity of attempting to ease the pain it brought by recovering remains and returning them to their families.  Once again, we are appealing for information that might help us complete our task, however insignificant that information may appear to be, and our earnest request is that this distinguished committee would lend its support to that appeal.  I will now ask Commissioner Flanagan to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Dalton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting us to attend this meeting.  The global pandemic has had a major impact on many aspects of all our lives for almost two years now, including the need to be cautious about travelling and meeting others.  While I would very much have welcomed the opportunity to appear before the committee in person today, and it is disappointing to be unable to do so, I am most grateful that I can attend virtually instead and look forward to our discussion.<\/p><p>I am also grateful to my fellow commissioner, Tim Dalton, for setting out the role and purpose of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains and the ongoing efforts to complete our work.<\/p><p> As Mr. Dalton has said, I was appointed as the UK commissioner in January this year.  I was honoured to accept this appointment to such an important body and I hope to have the opportunity to contribute to the successful location of some or all of the victims who have not yet been found and to giving their families the chance to give them the funerals and burials they have so long desired.<\/p><p> While we have not yet been able to meet face to face, I have had a number of virtual meetings with colleagues since my appointment.  It goes without saying, however, that the work of the investigators has been greatly affected and progress hampered by the Covid-19 restrictions.  We are very conscious that the three people whose remains have not yet been located disappeared in the 1970s and those who may have information which can be of assistance to us are now likely to be in their 70s or older.  I hope sincerely that as we emerge from this period, we will see new information coming forward before it is too late.<\/p><p> As the committee knows, an important aspect of the work of the commission over the years has been meeting and supporting the family members of the disappeared, both those whose remains have been recovered and those for whom the search continues.  Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible for us to attend any events with the families this year.  It is something I hope we can do perhaps in 2022.<\/p><p> Members of the committee may be aware of the WAVE Trauma Centre which provides support and care to anyone bereaved, injured or traumatised through the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  WAVE provides particular care to the families of the disappeared.  I would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to the tremendous support that the WAVE organisation, and its CEO, Ms Sandra Peake in particular, have provided to the families over the years and continue to provide during the challenging circumstances of the pandemic.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I would reiterate the vital importance to us of new information and urge the members of this committee to take any steps they can to assist us in obtaining it.  I am pleased to hand over now to Mr. Geoff Knupfer, the head of our investigation team, to provide some further details about what has happened since the commissioners last appeared before this committee and to respond to any questions committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Rosalie Flanagan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I thank Mrs. Flanagan very much.

In the first instance, in that any information given to our witnesses will be kept completely in secret and cannot and never has been used in any court of law, or for any other purpose whatsoever, other than in finding the remains of the victims.   I can understand, having met Mr. Oliver McVeigh recently in Belfast, along with our colleagues on the committee, how traumatic even after almost 40 years is that need for closure and demand for outcomes, as somebody out there must and does know what happened to those three men.  It is very sad and tragic.  The key point is that the conflict is over and there is no reason why anybody should fear giving information to the commission through the appropriate channels.  I believe Mr. Knupfer is present now and I will invite his submission in a moment.  The clarity that the commission is bringing to its search is very important.  As people are ageing, this does not mean that there are not people who can still come forward where they are under no legal pressure, or there can be no negative outcome by way of prosecution, in respect of any information that they may give.  There is also complete secrecy attached to such information.  It behoves all of the political parties and none represented here today that we call on everybody who is aware of anybody who may have any information, no matter how small that information may seem to them, in respect of how important that may be to help bring closure to families who do not have the opportunity to give their loved ones a Christian burial.  I invite Mr. Knupfer now to make his contribution, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111800002#C00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I thank Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, very much for the invitation to address today&rsquo;s meeting.  As the committee may be aware, the commission currently has 16 cases on its list of disappeared.  To date, 13 victims have been recovered, 11 by the commission, leaving only three cases outstanding at this moment in time.  They are: Joe Lynskey who disappeared in the summer of 1972; Columba McVeigh, who disappeared on or about 1 November 1975 and whose remains are believed to have been buried in Bragan Bog, County Monaghan and Robert Nairac, who was abducted from the Three Steps Inn, Drumintee, on 14 May 1977 and later murdered in Ravensdale, County Louth.  It seems probable that his remains are buried in that general area.<\/p> <p>  As the committee have heard from Commissioner Flanagan, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic across these islands has severely hampered the operation of the commission team for the past 18 months or so.  The travel of investigators to undertake face-to-face interviews and to visit potential sites was curtailed completely.  In fact any activity which could not be conducted from home virtually ground to a halt.  Thank goodness, hotels are now beginning to reopen and travel restrictions have largely been lifted.  I am relieved to report that things on the operational side of the commission are gradually returning to some degree of normality.<\/p> <p>  Around the time we previously addressed the committee in 2018, we were in the process of making plans to commence a further search of Bragan Bog in County Monaghan to try to locate the remains of Columba McVeigh.  This operation commenced in September 2018 but was suspended during the winter due to poor weather, restricted daylight hours and dangerous ground and working conditions.  Work resumed in the summer of 2019 and concluded in September that year.  Sadly, the remains of Columba McVeigh were not located.<\/p> <p>  Since the establishment of the commission in 1999 some 21 acres or 8.5 ha of Bragan Bog have now been searched.  I should add that we are entirely satisfied that Columba was murdered and buried at Bragan and that we have not been intentionally misled in that respect.  Unfortunately, his current whereabouts remain something of a mystery.  It raises questions as to whether or not this is the correct location within the bog or whether for some reason or other his body could have been removed from that location.  It would only have to be moved to, say, the other side of a track, and thus outside the search area, to entirely compromise the search process.  As ever, we would be pleased to hear from anyone who has any information on this case, however trivial they consider it to be, it could be the vital link we are missing.<\/p> <p>  Inquiries and research into the other cases of Joe Lynskey and Robert Nairac continue.  At this point in time, however, we have no fresh substantive information on either case sufficient to warrant a physical search.  In fact the latter case, that of Robert Nairac, remains the only one for which we have never had sufficient information to merit a physical search.  Again, we would welcome any information from the public on either of these cases.<\/p> <p>  We are particularly conscious that time marches on relentlessly.  We know that some of those directly involved in these events have passed away in recent years.  Others, we believe, might well be reluctant to engage because their families, friends or neighbours are totally unaware of their involvement in these sad events some 40 or 50 years ago.  Despite this we would urge anyone with any relevant information, to please contact the commission directly as a matter of urgency or, if needs be, indirectly.<\/p> <p>  This is an entirely humanitarian process and we really do need help to return these lost souls to their loved ones for Christian burial.  I remind everyone that since the inception of the commission in 1999, no one has ever been interviewed as a suspect, arrested, charged or convicted as a result of information that was passed to it on the disappeared.  It is well known that such information can only be used to recover and repatriate victims.  The commission is expressly forbidden by law to pass information on to other individuals or organisations.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, an anonymous donor put up the sum of US $60,000 by way of a reward for information which results in the recovery of one or more of the victims.<\/p><p>That reward has not been claimed to date.  Anyone who wishes to claim the reward must contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or <i>www.crimestoppers-uk.org<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We are aware that a recent television drama, &quot;Bloodlands&quot;, referred to the work of the commission.  It is important to clarify that this was an entirely fictional scenario.  It did not relate in any way to any real commission case and the so-called &quot;technology&quot; deployed to locate human remains in the programme does not actually exist.  The commission was not consulted prior to or during the writing of this script.  However, we were made aware of the programme prior to its broadcast.<br\/><br\/>The commission is jointly funded by the Irish and UK Governments.  In order to limit the commission's operational costs, the commission does not actually employ any full-time staff.  A joint secretariat is provided by the staff of the Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Justice and other members of the commission work on a contractual basis or daily-rate basis only.<br\/><br\/>We continue to work very closely with the WAVE Trauma Centre.  We are most grateful for the assistance they provide to the commission in its endeavours but, more importantly, for the truly remarkable level of care and support they provide to those victims of the Troubles who are on their books.  We are indebted, indeed, to the CEO of WAVE, Ms Sandra Peake, and her staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Geoff Knupfer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Knupfer for his address and the clarity which he is bringing to the needs of the commission to finalise the return or the identification of the remains and the recovery to the family.<\/p> <p>  For members who may have been a little late, in terms of our communications, I repeat that Fianna F&aacute;il will be followed by Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, SDLP, Alliance, Independents, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n of Aont&uacute;, Sinn F&eacute;in again, Labour and the Green Party.

I commend them on the important work that they are carrying out on behalf of the State, and also Mrs. Rosalie Flanagan, as nominee of the British Government.<\/p><p>I proposed, in 2018, that the commission would be invited to address this committee's predecessor.  I also proposed, this time, when we were drafting our work programme for this year, that the commission would be invited back to give us an update on its work.  That was to give us in a parliamentary chamber the opportunity to endorse the important work and the difficult task that the commission has been assigned and that, hopefully, some coverage of our proceedings, be it in the print or broadcast media, might create that extra awareness that is needed, the coverage would get to the people who have information and who have not yet passed it on, and finally, their consciences might get to them and they would pass on that information.  The three guests have outlined clearly that if a person passes on information it cannot be used for any other purposes and the Cathaoirleach outlined that clearly as well.  People who provide information will not be prosecuted in relation to any of their misdeeds or any other misdemeanours, if they carried out some.<\/p><p>I have been familiar with the work of the victims' commission since 1998 because the late John Wilson, the former T&aacute;naiste whom I had a very close working relationship with over many years, was the first person appointed by the Irish Government.  I had the privilege of succeeding him as a Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan when he retired in 1992.  At that time, without knowing the detail of any particular cases, I knew how difficult that work was from talking to John Wilson about it on a general basis.  I note those who succeeded him.  Mr. Bloomfield carried out admirable work, as did Mr. Frank Murray.  It is important that we recognise the work of the people who served in the roles previously as well.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, there were very many reprehensible, vile and heinous crimes during the era known as the Troubles but I suppose the case of the 16 disappeared really is absolutely reprehensible.  All murders, maiming of people and injuries inflicted on people are reprehensible but to abduct, kill and secretly bury persons and not have them returned to their families is beyond comprehension.<\/p><p>The task of the commission is to return to families the remains of persons killed by paramilitaries.  The least that anybody deserves is a Christian burial.  We can never emphasise enough how important it is.<\/p><p>We met Oliver McVeigh last week, as the Cathaoirleach said, Columba's brother.  Mr. McVeigh appealed again to anybody with information or any organisation that they have, to put it mildly, a moral duty to pass on any relevant information and as a committee, we totally endorse that.<\/p><p>From speaking with families that the commission has worked with over years, I know they very much appreciate the commission's method in going about its business and the dignified, gracious and understanding manner in which it carries out that work.  The commission is to be commended in that respect.<\/p><p>My purpose in suggesting that the commission come before the committee was, as I stated at the outset, to endorse publicly the important work of the commission and also to emphasise that the commission tasks are not yet complete, unfortunately.  What we would like to see is, obviously, the other three bodies returned to their loved ones.<\/p><p>Two of my colleagues, Senators McGreehan and Blaney, hope to be with us later.  They are attending the Seanad, which the Taoiseach is addressing.<\/p><p>As I stated earlier, John Wilson was appointed by the Government in May 1998, a month following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  That demonstrated the importance that the Governments at that time attached to this work because it was a month after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  What he was tasked with at that time was to review services and arrangements in place to meet the needs of victims of Northern Ireland violence.  John Wilson was appointed.  Mr. Bloomfield was appointed by the British Government subsequently to carry out that important task on behalf of both Governments.<\/p><p>The first report of the victims' commission, A Place and a Name, was published in July 1999.  In one particular comment in regard to the disappeared, it states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAnyone with the slightest shred of information on the possible location of bodies should make this known to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains. <\/blockquote> <p>It is sad that today, at the end of 2021, we are appealing still for information so that the remains of innocent people murdered and buried in secret, and some of them abducted, murdered and secretly buried, have not yet been returned to their loved ones.

As Mr. Dalton explained, it is difficult to talk about these engagements but some information certainly comes directly to us.  Other contacts come through intermediaries.  It is always a problem where we do not have direct access to the person who is providing information.  If it comes through a third party, there is a dilemma in not being able to ask the important questions, from our perspective.  As an example, if we are examining a grave site, ideally we would like to speak to the people who dug that grave.  They will know what the ground profile is like, what they encountered on the day, where they stood and what they saw.  This is the sort of information we cannot get through third parties or, if we do, it will have been diluted in some way.<\/p> <p>  An issue we encountered in one case, without going into details, related to where discussions occurred prior to information being passed to the commission. This was decided, effectively, by committee, with a group of people sitting around a table and arriving at a conclusion regarding the detail they would provide to the commission.  Unfortunately, in such circumstances, you tend to get the views of the loudest voice rather than those of the best informed.  These are the sorts of problems we have encountered over the years, although on other occasions, the information has been excellent.<\/p> <p>  Another issue relates to the time gap between the events and the searching today.  Memories fail or fade and, as I mentioned earlier, many people have passed away in the intervening years.  In one case, again without going into details, people we could have talked to had died and they did so without having contacted the commission or passing on information via a third party.  We urge anyone with any information, however trivial they believe it to be, to please contact us directly.  If they are not prepared to do that or cannot do that, we urge them to come through a third party.  We look forward to hearing from them.<\/p> <p>  This is entirely an intelligence-led operation.

I am trying to ask questions within that, as our guests will understand.  Last week, we had the opportunity to meet Mr. Oliver McVeigh, as the Chairman mentioned.  He was clear about how desperately he and his family want to find his brother, a subject of significant work on the commission's part.  He urged us, as public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas, to remind everybody to do everything they could to be of assistance with that.  He asked us to call on everybody, including all the political parties, to be clear that information, if it exists, should be provided to the commission directly and without delay to enable the search to continue.  Having met Mr. McVeigh and having had the opportunity to listen to him and the pain he, his mother and his family experienced and that he continues to experience in the absence of his brother, without the opportunity to give him a Christian burial or to begin to mourn the stages of death in the way a person might having gone through a burial, members of the committee want to take that opportunity.   It is our good fortune our guests happen to be appearing before the committee this week, given we met Mr. McVeigh last week.  It is important for me to take the opportunity to highlight that.<\/p> <p>  In light of Mr. Dalton's experience in the Department of Justice and his work throughout the period leading up to the Good Friday Agreement period, he has been engaged in reconciliation efforts for many years.  Will he speak to how important the resolution and recovery of bodies is towards the overall reconciliation effort, having regard, perhaps, to the many families he will have met during his work in its various guises?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111800002#E00700","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":610,"content":"<p>It is very important.  In the period leading up to the Good Friday Agreement, I was part of the back-up Civil Service team.  Every element of the agreement is relevant and important.  Without the little pieces in the agreement, some of which were more difficult than others, such as the release of a large number of prisoners and the constitutional changes, there would have been no agreement.  The reconciliation aspect was a core aspect.  I am not saying that without it, there would have been no agreement but every element of the agreement was significant and the fact reconciliation was included demonstrated at that time the importance everyone attached to it.  Of course, the people of Ireland voted for that agreement, which contained the element of reconciliation.<\/p> <p>  Like others on the commission, I have met families who have lost people in the conflict.  Some were disappeared, while others were not and simply lost their lives in the conflict.  Outcomes that enable them to recall their loved ones with dignity are important, and outcomes that do not, such as those that prevent them from having a burial and closing the sad chapter, remain painful.  It is difficult to think of this in terms of happiness but we have seen happiness in the faces of people who, after a number of years, have managed to find the remains of their loved ones.  It brings enormous relief and happiness.  It is not happiness in the sense of recovering alive someone who was lost but it produces a great deal of relief in families.  In the three outstanding cases, there is still great sadness.  That is why we regard it as an honour to have the opportunity to bring happiness to those people at long last or some measure of relief from suffering.

On the work they have undertaken and continue to carry out, they and all those who have assisted them throughout this State need to be commended.<\/p><p>The issue of those who were abducted, shot and secretly buried by the IRA is a terrible legacy of the decades of conflict that we have come through.  That is very clear.  Sadly, it is not the first time it has happened in our history.  As we know, there are still issues dating back to the Civil War and the Tan War.  This generation of republicans identifies the wrong that was done and is trying to undo that wrong.  We have heard some talk today about how information has been passed that has led to the recovery of most, but not all, of the missing.  As a result of those efforts, 13 of the 16 people killed and buried by republicans have been recovered.  For me, it will not be good enough until everyone is recovered.  There are three who have still not been recovered: Robert Nairac, Joe Lynskey and Columba McVeigh.  The failure thus far to find them is not due to any lack of resolve or co-operation by republicans.  It is important that we use the committee and the stage we have today to appeal unambiguously to anyone with information, no matter how insignificant he or she feels it is, to make it available, as my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, outlined in his opening remarks.  The information could be vital to the work of the commission.

The very powerful testimonies we heard from the Ballymurphy and Springhill families, particularly those we met at WAVE last week, add to the resolve of every member of this committee to do all that can be done collectively and individually to urge people to come forward and end the pain of Oliver McVeigh, which we noted last week, and the pain other families are going through.<\/p><p> Again, I commend the work of the commission and look forward to hearing the rest of the presentations, submissions and answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111800002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finucane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Is there anyone else that Sinn F&eacute;in would like to address?

To echo the words of Senator Black, their work is important.  As the delegates said in their submission, the work is humanitarian in orientation and important to the families of the victims and in achieving truth, justice and reconciliation.  The commission is certainly one of the more successful initiatives in achieving some reconciliation and comfort for the families in the wake of the Troubles.  We should all be learning from that.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman was talking about LiDAR.  Are there things that we, as members of a committee, can do to support the commission?  Are the things the two Governments can do to support the commission and that we could help to advocate?  What is it that we can do to help the delegates to continue the good work?<\/p> <p>  I would like to take a moment to springboard from the good work the delegates are doing to consider the issue of truth and justice in general.  The Independent Commission on Information Retrieval was part of the Stormont House Agreement in 2014.  Its aim was not judicial prosecution but to establish the truth, achieve reconciliation and give families the information they wanted about their loved ones to help with the grieving process.  While there has been detailed agreement regarding the Independent Commission on Information and Retrieval, we have never seen any legislation or progress on it here.  An agreement would require legislation in Dublin and also Westminster.  Any time I have asked about it, I have been told there is ongoing contact with Westminster.  The Irish Government should not be waiting for the British Government but should be progressing this ourselves.  Nothing is stopping us from carrying out our own pre-legislative scrutiny to make progress and from putting moral pressure on the British Government to act.<\/p> <p>  It is important to highlight the effect the British Government's approach in the form of a unilateral amnesty has had on communities and family members of victims.  It has been very upsetting and has caused more problems.  Again, we need to work with victims' families so we can have proper healing, truth, reconciliation and, ultimately, justice.  The commission provides an excellent example of that in practice.  It is a shame that we have not been able to follow through in other areas.<\/p> <p>  I will leave my little speech there and return to my original questions: is there something we can do to help the delegates with their work, and is there something the two Governments can do to help the commission with its work that we can advocate as a committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111800002#G00600","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637193600,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I will take that question.  Both Governments have always been very helpful to us in our work.  We have never had the experience of being refused when we wanted to do something or get some equipment, or anything like that.  We have had significant support on that front.  Nevertheless, the suggestion made by the Chairman on affording another technological opportunity is very welcome.  If we wanted to do something like that, there would certainly be no resistance from the Governments.<\/p><p>In fact, we would get support because they have been supportive all the way through.<\/p><p> Anther thing I will say, in case I do not think to say it later, is that Mr. Knupfer has emphasised the amount of work that has been undertaken in the case of Columba McVeigh and all the excavations and so on that have taken place.  Having said that, we would not want anybody to think that that is the end of the road insofar as we are concerned in the case of Columba McVeigh or anybody else.  If we get any new credible information about Bragan Bog or about Columba McVeigh or anybody else from this point onwards, anything we have not had before, we will act on it and treat it seriously.<\/p><p> We are getting back to the same point.  What we need is information.  That is our most urgent requirement, and that is one way in which the committee can be of most assistance to us - by making it clear that information is what is needed to end what is a tragedy for the families who still have no idea as to what happened to their loved ones.  Well, they know what happened but they have not had access to the remains of their loved ones.  That is the primary requirement.  It is very heartening to us to hear members of the committee speak about all this.  Obviously, the committee has a great understanding of the suffering that has been experienced by the people concerned.  That is heartening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021111800002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Dalton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637193600,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I do now know if any of our Senators have arrived yet.  If it is helpful, we can go into a second round.  I just want to see if I can try to draw a few of the threads together.  We should take up the invitation, at the appropriate time and under the appropriate circumstances, that Mr. Knupfer made that we visit the site of Bragan Bog.  Perhaps there are other appropriate visits we could do.  For example, Robert Nairac was murdered in my county, and I do not see why we should not visit a known location where there may have been evidence, if that makes sense.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps we could also agree that we will write to the Department.  I think Ordnance Survey Ireland - I can confirm that later on - has the LiDAR aeroplane.  Perhaps we could see whether it would be able to do a survey, provided that it makes sense to Mr. Knupfer and his technical people.  If that makes sense, we should do that.<\/p> <p>  It may be appropriate that we table a motion in the D&aacute;il, having listened to the witnesses' evidence today.  The clerk will look at the process but I suggest that we propose that perhaps the leaders of the parties will make statements on the matter.  It might be helpful to get the Taoiseach, the leaders of Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and Independents in to articulate the true purpose of the commission's search to recover these bodies and to give closure to the families.

Has it sent out a mixed message in any way that could damage its work and the appeal for information?<\/p> <p>  The commission gets on with its work and so on.  Does it get advice or has it got assistance from, say, the Department of Justice or some of the Government agencies in having a worthwhile information programme nationally, maybe in Britain as well if that is needed, to outline the absolute urgency of this?  As has been said, everybody is getting older.  I am sure it gets more difficult as every day goes on.  The memories fade and locations will be more difficult to search.  The work therefore gets more difficult with each passing day.  Apart from families and communities that have taken a particular interest and have been affected by the Troubles and that awful era of murder and mayhem, I do not know if there is a wide enough appreciation that we still have three families whose loved ones' remains have not been returned to them and that the commission's work is ongoing and of the utmost importance to all of us.  Should consideration be given to a higher media profile regarding the importance of this work and the need to make further progress as soon as possible in view of the time lapse between the awful abduction and murder of these innocent people?<\/p> <p>  Is Bragan Bog and the area that has been searched preserved or fenced off at the moment, or can people go about their daily business?

I ask the Deputy to pull me up if I miss anything.<\/p> <p>  No, we do not think \"Bloodlands\" has caused damage.  What concerned us enormously at the time was whether people believed we might be passing information to the programme makers, which we certainly were not.  I think there were one or two discussions just prior to broadcast about names attributed to members of the commission portrayed on screen, and the programme makers very kindly removed those names.  There have been a number of documentaries on radio and television, in Ireland and beyond, covering the work of the commission, and in I think every single one we have made appeals for information and tried to explain that we are not remotely interested in what people did, other than if it would help us fine-tune the search process.  We always make appeals for information on the basis that we do not want to speak to third parties.  We would rather speak to the primary sources because that gives the best information we could possibly ask for.  I think all three of us have said today and in the past that witnesses have nothing to fear from talking to us.  We are not sure why people have not come forward.  We cannot explain it.  We know that there are other people out there who were involved in these events and have not come forward.  To appeal to them to do so is really as far as we can go.  As I said, why they will not speak to us directly we are at a loss to understand.  I do not think anybody is putting pressure on them not to do so - not as far as we are aware, anyway.  A member of our organisation leads on our media very proficiently.  He has done it for a number of years and makes a great job of it, but you can only make so many appeals before the broadcast media switch off and the print media say, \"We have done all that before.\"  They are looking for something new, not a rehash of what we have done in the past.  That is a big problem for us.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, the Deputy mentioned Bragan Bog and whether it is fenced off.  No, it is not.  It is open to anybody who wants to go there, but it is a very remote and wild area.  It has its own microclimate.  There can be blazing sunshine in Monaghan town while on Bragan Bog, just nine miles or ten miles or perhaps 12 km or 13 km away, it could be doing anything from snowing to cracking the flags.  It is a very strange area in that respect.  There is a lot of forestry up there and plantations that have been planted since the 1970s and some harvesting goes on from time to time.<\/p><p>We try as best we can to manage that with the forestry authorities and they have been enormously helpful to us over the years.<\/p><p> I hope I have answered all the Deputy's questions there.

We know what people did.<\/p> <p>  Something that struck me in our trip last week, and some colleagues as well, was we met more groups then.  We met Mr. McVeigh.  We met Rev. David Clements, whose father, who was in the RUC, was murdered.  We met Mr. Alan McBride whose family were murdered in the Shankill bomb attack.  We met families of the Ballymurphy massacre who suffered enormous intergenerational trauma and families of the Springhill massacre.  All of those people really stuck with me over the weekend, and I am sure with colleagues as well.  I was thinking about Ms Irene Connolly and the late Ms Joan Connolly in Ballymurphy over the weekend and, indeed, Ms Jacqueline Butler from Springhill.  As we said to them at the time, you remember their faces.  You remember what their voices sound like.  You remember, when you have that personal connection.<\/p> <p>  Something that struck me also when we visited the WAVE Trauma Centre - which Mr. Knupfer has reference and which really is excellent, and we must commend Ms Sandra Peake, yet again, on her work - in particular, with Mr. McVeigh, was how alone he was, in comparison, in trying to articulate his voice on behalf of his brother and mother, to try to be heard and how different perhaps that was to some of the other experiences that we had had.  Although all of the people who met stuck with me, certainly, over the weekend, that sense of being more alone really stood out.  A D&aacute;il motion is an excellent idea to have, yet again, that opportunity, many decades later, to put on the record what we are asking people to do and how we are asking people to contribute information.  For the benefit of the record of the Oireachtas, I wanted to mention that.  As members of the committee, we had the good fortune, opportunity and privilege to meet people and to listen to them.  As we are doing that as public representatives, on behalf of our constituents, the very least that we can do is come back and relay that experience, and what that experience looked like and felt like, back onto the record of the Oireachtas so that people know what it was like.
