It is an arrangement that is valued by both islands and the continuation of this arrangement is a stated objective of the Irish and UK Governments.  In the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, it is important that any arrangements necessary to maintain the common travel area are made.<\/p><p>The common travel area provides for associated rights and entitlements which enable Irish and UK citizens to move freely between and reside in both jurisdictions.  These rights and entitlements include access to employment, healthcare, education and social benefits, as well as the right to vote in certain elections.  I benefitted from those rights when studying in the UK.  <\/p><p>Article 2 of the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, within the draft withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK, is a translation into legal terms of the acknowledgment between the EU and UK negotiators, made in their joint report of December 2017, that the UK and Ireland may continue to make arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of persons between their territories.  This has been marked as green, indicating that it has been agreed at negotiator level, and it is a welcome provision in seeking to maintain the common travel area insofar as it relates to the EU-UK negotiations. <\/p><p>The maintenance of the common travel area is a bilateral matter.  Work is ongoing with the UK and domestically to ensure that the necessary provisions are made in both jurisdictions in order that the common travel area continues to function effectively after the UK leaves the EU.

That has not happened.  If we look at the draft conclusions that are being put to the European Council, they are very strong.  They state that the European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland-Northern Ireland.  It recalls commitments undertaken by the United Kingdom in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018 and insists on the need for intensified efforts in order that the withdrawal agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal.

As we will not find solutions if people are not sitting around a table, we are encouraging the British Government to intensify its efforts to bring some certainty and clarity as to what it is looking for and is willing to put forward as solutions that can deliver on the commitments they have made in writing.

This was the first bilateral agreement to be signed between the EU and Cuba.  Its signature marked a further positive step forward in relations between the EU and Cuba, which have improved considerably in recent years.  The agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars, namely, political dialogue, co-operation and sectoral policy dialogue and trade and trade co-operation.  The core aim is to open channels of dialogue and co-operation between the EU and Cuba in order to assist the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, strengthen human rights and democracy and work together to achieve the sustainable development goals.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2017, the European Parliament voted to endorse the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement and in May 2018, the first EU-Cuba joint council took place in Brussels during which implementation was discussed.  While most of the agreement has been provisionally applied since November 2017, its full application will require ratification by the EU once all member states have completed their own internal legal procedures.  As it stands, 14 member states have done so.  The remaining member states, including Ireland, have yet to complete their internal procedures.  I look forward to working with colleagues in the Oireachtas to complete Ireland&rsquo;s internal legal procedures and work is under way towards this objective. I hope to have it completed before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  The entry into force of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement and improvements in the EU-Cuba relationship will in turn have helpful consequences for the Ireland-Cuba relationship.  Ireland has a positive relationship with Cuba which was further cemented by the successful visit of President Higgins to the island in February 2017.  My assessment is that this agreement provides a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen both EU-Cuba and Ireland-Cuba relations.  I look forward to continued positive developments in the period ahead, including the completion by Ireland of the internal legal procedures necessary for ratification during 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700007#E00700","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1530093900,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

The target timeframe of 15 working days for Passport Express renewals and Northern Ireland Passport Express renewals is also currently being met.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service acknowledges that for certain categories such as first-time applicants and applicants with lost or stolen passports, processing is taking longer due to additional security checks.  I am sure the Deputies will understand that first-time applicants require additional security measures, including robust identity verification and entitlement checking and as a result can take longer to process.  Babies and children applying for their first passport also fall within this category and in cases where other family members have submitted renewal applications alongside the first-time application, all applications will be linked in the system and will only be dealt with once the necessary checks have been completed on the first-time passport.  This has caused particular problems for families.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is doing everything to ensure passports are processed as quickly as possible.  In addition to the intake of TCOs and the use of targeted overtime, experienced staff from across the Department have been redeployed to process applications and respond to customer queries.  I understand that more than 30 people in the Department have been redeployed to the service.<\/p>  <p>  A central element of my Department's approach to managing increasing application volumes has been the implementation of service improvements to minimise the impact of unusually high application volumes on turnaround times.  The passport reform programme is delivering major upgrades to technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.  The online passport application service, which was launched last year, will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of exceptionally high volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the service.  I expect that by the end of the year this online service will also be available for renewing children's applications, which will be a major step forward for families.  I encourage all applicants wherever possible to renew their passports using the online renewal service.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the combination of delivery upgrades to the technology platforms and application process together with the recruitment of adequate TCOs and the reallocation of resources from other divisions on a temporary basis is sufficient to meet demand during this peak season for thePassport Service.  I also acknowledge that the service has not been what we would like it to be for the past number of weeks.  The staff have been doing a heroic job given the extraordinary volumes with which they have had to deal.  We are reviewing how the peak period is being managed this year to ensure we learn lessons for next year.  Once we get over the peak demand period, which is coming to an end, the Deputies will find that the process will be much easier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700008#F00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1530094500,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am still at a loss about what the problem is within the system.

An official from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts said that it had taken more than six weeks to process 27,000 passport applications, which is 30 working days, while it had taken up to eight weeks to process a further 22,000 applications, which is 40 working days.

There has been a dramatic increase in the number of passport applications across multiple platforms.  The online application process has worked well and we are ahead of our turnaround target times.  In many cases, the turnaround time for half of online applicants is five days rather than ten days plus postage.  Problems occur when children are applying for a first-time passport and when passports have been lost and people need a replacement quickly.  They make an application and follow that up with a phone call or an email but do not get an answer.  We are trying to deal with tens of thousands of phone calls and emails each week.  The pressure this places on staff at peak time coupled with significant increases in demand for passports across all platforms has resulted in delays.  As a result, we have taken on an extra 220 temporary staff, which we take on every year in the build up to the peak season, but we have also redeployed approximately 30 experienced staff on a temporary basis to respond to people by phone and email more quickly.  If people do not get responses by phone, they tend to work through Deputies' offices and so on and, therefore, we have had to put systems in place to deal politically with many applications, which is not the way to do this efficiently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700008#F00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1530094500,"counter":78,"content":"<p>My question also concerns the long delays in issuing passports.

There are problems with new applicants, renewals and children's passports, and there is still a problem with online applications.  Constituents in Laois-Offaly come to me constantly with cases like this.  Sometimes with the help of staff, we manage to get them through while, at other times, we do not.  I understand that staff are working hard and that additional staff have been deployed but there are delays for new applicants, renewals and online applications.<\/p><p>This morning, I dealt with the case of a family in Portlaoise that is going to Lourdes.  It has been promised that its outstanding passport will be ready today or tomorrow and I hope that is what transpires.  The passport in question was applied for seven weeks ago, in early May.  Constituents are relaying back to us that there are particular problems trying to get responses from the Dublin office about the current status of their passport applications.  We are encouraging people to apply online.  Although I agree with the T&aacute;naiste that it is a better system, there are delays that need to be addressed.

It should also be possible to deal with emergency situations quickly without stalling the processing of the passport applications of everybody else.  A considerable improvement will be seen when it becomes possible to apply for child passports online.  When a number of family members are renewing passports currently, the adult passports are delayed because of the security checks required for child passports.  We are assessing at the moment.  We are learning lessons from what has happened this year.  The problems stem back to closure of the Passport Office for a couple of days during the difficult weather period.  While the backlog started then, the difficulty experienced at that time is certainly not the sole reason for the backlog.

As a result of the use of technology and online systems, the vast majority of passports are being delivered on time or quicker than the anticipated turnaround time.

We are looking at communications with a view to giving people the ability to get an update on the status of their passport applications within the system without having to contact politicians to get that information.

Since then, Irish ships have rescued more than 16,000 people from the Mediterranean.  Yesterday, one of our member states and friends asked for help and we gave it, there and then, by means of a practical response.  We have offered to take 4,000 migrants in the context of the pressures that Italy, primarily, faces.  We have taken nearly 2,000 so far.  The actual figure is 1,842 and by the end of the year it will certainly be 2,000.  We will take our 4,000.  That is well above the figure that the quotas would have assigned to Ireland on a country-by-country, <i>pro rata<\/i>basis.  We made a conscious decision, which I remember because I was involved with it, to go well beyond the quota figure that would have been proportionate to Ireland's population.

This is compounded, made much worse, by the cost of school activities and the ongoing need to contribute to schools' current funding requirements.  Parents are fundraising left, right and centre to pay for electricity, heating and other very basic charges that schools must meet.  On average, the Government gives a school approximately &euro;46,000 a year for a its operating costs against an average expenditure of approximately &euro;91,000.  This is eaten up by lighting, heating, cleaning, insurance, classroom equipment, printing, stationery and so on.  Depending on the size of the school, the grant of &euro;170 per pupil can cover between 42% and 62% of a school's costs.  In other words, the smaller or more medium-sized the school, the worse the hit.  They are particularly disadvantaged.  What is very poor is the treatment meted out to DEIS schools, the most disadvantaged schools.  The funding gap for them is very difficult and they are hardest hit because they have far less fundraising capacity, with the most needy families and pupils attending such schools.<\/p>  <p>  The funding position in respect of schools is therefore clearly unsustainable.  This was revealed in the Grant Thornton report published last February into the current funding issues pertaining to primary schools across the country.  The programme for Government committed to annual increases in primary and capitation grants, but the Government has not implemented this commitment.  The Minister has in 2018 repeated a commitment made in the 2017 Action Plan for Education, but again there has been no delivery on the commitment.  The reason is that the Government is essentially punishing schools and families who fundraise.  Why?  The Government feels they are taking up the slack.  It believes it does not need to add to or prioritise the capitation grant.  It is happy to let the schools take up the matter with the various fundraisers.  One principal in a small rural school, for example, fundraised for four interactive whiteboards, 15 iPads, new windows and the conversion of a boiler house and store into a learning support room.  This is not an exception: such fundraising efforts are going on across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Rhetoric needs to be turned into reality and increased capitation grants need to be provided for in this year's budget and on a phased basis in subsequent budgets and plans.  Does the Taoiseach accept that capitation grants at current levels are wholly inadequate to fund our primary schools?  Does he accept that small and medium-sized schools and DEIS schools are particularly disadvantaged by the system?  Will he commit to a generous increase in capitation grants in this year's budget as the beginning of a phased programme of increases in subsequent years?  We will insist on such a provision in this year's budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700012#K00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1530096900,"counter":127,"content":"<p>The issue of capitation will, of course, be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.  There is a programme for Government commitment to increase capitation, so it is something we intend to do.  I appreciate that capitation has been cut back in recent years and, unlike many things, has not been restored.  It goes towards the running costs of schools and I would be very much in favour of an increase in capitation if we could find provision for it within what is left to us in the forthcoming budget.<\/p>  <p>  It is important, though, never to lose sight of the wider picture.  This year, we will spend &euro;10 billion on education, more than any Government has spent in any year since the foundation of the State.  What does this mean in practice?  It means we have been able to hire 5,000 extra teachers in the past two years.  It means we will have the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever from this August and September.  It means we now have 15,000 special needs assistants, more than we have garda&iacute;, for example, even though Garda numbers are increasing.  In fact, we now spend more on special education than we do on third level education, and funding for the latter is now being restored as well as a consequence of budget decisions made.  A massive school building programme is happening all over the country, which Deputies will know from their constituency work.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is not possible to do everything, or everything one would like to do, in one year.  This is why we must prioritise.  What we have prioritised in recent years is new, more modern school buildings; additional teachers; a lower pupil-teacher ratio; the introduction of new subjects at leaving certificate - physical education and computer science, for example; the restoration of funding to our universities; the introduction of two years of free preschool education; and other measures, including subsidised childcare.  We have seen enormous progress in the short recovery we have had in recent years in all these areas.  I absolutely accept that capitation will have to be considered as part of this.  However, as I said before and will say again, it is never possible to do everything one would like to do in one year and we need to be prudent.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen the kinds of promises Fianna F&aacute;il is making.

However, the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il's promises add up to &euro;1.6 billion when the discretionary package is approximately &euro;800 million means that a reasonable person cannot have any confidence that the promises Fianna F&aacute;il is making in respect of education or anything else can be believed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700012#K00800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1530096900,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I am entitled to raise issues of this kind, and the last person to lecture anyone on promises is the Taoiseach.

That cannot be minimised in any way; Mr. Harris lost his father.  What also cannot be minimised or sidelined are the concerns raised by victims of British state collusion, such as those expressed by Stephen Travers of the Miami Showband on the radio this morning.  Mr. Travers spoke of RUC collusion and the old RUC culture of political policing and cover up.  He regards Mr. Harris as part of that culture which has denied people the truth.  Similar concerns have been voiced by representatives of the Relatives for Justice campaign group.  They say that Mr. Harris \"has at every opportunity sought to thwart families in the search for truth and accountability\", and that he \"has had a stranglehold on legacy and has acted partially and with vested interest at all times\".<\/p>  <p>  The issue of Mr. Harris's evidence at the Smithwick tribunal being described as \"nonsense\" by a former Garda Commissioner has also arisen.

Has he read the statement from Relatives for Justice?  I believe it is appropriate for the Taoiseach to acknowledge and respond to the concerns they have expressed.  Mr. Harris's main job must be to deliver radical reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to develop an ethos of transparency, best practice and accountability.  To do this, he must first earn the confidence and trust of the public, particularly regarding his involvement with legacy cases.  He has to demonstrate that he in no way subscribes to the toxic, vindictive policing culture which necessitated the disbandment of the RUC.<\/p>  <p>  How does the Taoiseach respond to Stephen Travers?

I had an opportunity to hear Mr. Travers on the radio this morning.  My sympathies go to anyone and any family affected by the Troubles, that awful period of our history and those decades during which various organisations wrought appalling violence on people north and south of the Border.  As the Deputy mentioned, the new Commissioner designate was affected by that in one of the most direct ways in losing his father to terrorism.  We can all understand how that affects people for their entire lives.<\/p>  <p>  The process by which the new Commissioner designate, Mr. Drew Harris, was appointed was very much in line with the reforms we have introduced to policing in recent years.  There was an open international competition.  We sought applications from within policing and without, from within Ireland and from other states.  A large number of people applied for the job and a shortlist was produced.  The work was done by the Public Appointments Service working with the Policing Authority, which then made a recommendation to Government.  Government very pleased yesterday to approve that recommendation and to appoint Mr. Drew Harris as Commissioner designate.  It is intended that he will take over in September.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the acting Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, in particular for agreeing to stay on during that period to work with Mr. Harris on the transition, and for the good job he has done in recent months, very much steadying the ship in the Garda.  I thank him for that particular service.<\/p>  <p>  Drew Harris will bring about better policing in Ireland - policing our communities better and policing our home places better.  He will be able to bring about greater accountability on behalf of the Garda.  He was very much involved in the transition from the RUC to the PSNI, which I believe we all agree has been a big success.  He can bring those abilities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  He is familiar with the accountability mechanism such as the policing board which exists in Northern Ireland and he will engage very well with the Policing Authority in that regard.

The doctrine of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has been to circle the wagons around the national finances and to limit debate by not publishing the full range of national statistics.  For example, because the Minister has decided to pursue his own so-called fiscal stance, the objective data on Ireland's fiscal space are no longer being published.<\/p>  <p>  I accept we need to lower the national debt, but the best way to do that is by putting in place the conditions for the future growth of the economy, as the Labour Party has repeatedly done.<\/p><p>We agree with the need to roll out infrastructure in transport, water and electricity in order that businesses can depend on them and expand.  There will be an equally important need to invest in our social infrastructure.  Investing in people strengthens our economy.  We need to boost our investment in education at all levels in order that workers are more productive and in order that every citizen of Ireland has the chance to fulfil his or her own full potential.  Social investment has a double pay-off.  It gives people a better quality of life and, when done strategically, it also boosts the future growth potential of the economy.  The failure to expand Ireland's social infrastructure, including affordable housing, childcare and public transport, will hold back the future economy.  We cannot afford to not make these investments.  We need to end the permanent crisis in housing in order that workers can afford to take up jobs and work in our towns and cities.  A recent report showed a household now needs to be in the top 10% of income in order to afford the median house price in Dublin.  That is unsustainable.  A person off work for a week waiting for a health appointment represents a blow to the economy.  A person forced to commute 90 minutes each way due to the price of houses is a loss to our economy.  We know business need to flock to where the physical infrastructure is the best and most robust.  The economy will never grow to the same extent across the country as a whole unless we put in place the infrastructure to make investing outside our larger cities more attractive.  Failing to make the necessary strategic decisions now is not fiscal prudence; it is a failure to meet the obvious needs of our people.  It will have an obvious detrimental impact on our economy.  <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach has often referred to the lost decade.  He is in danger of making the loss permanent.  Is it not time now for economic debate in the House to be open and focused on the needs of all our people rather than, as it seems from the Taoiseach's initial responses to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, on using the budget to try to box political parties into positions before an impending general election?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700013#L02600","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530098100,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The Government is very interested in and very welcoming of an open debate on budget priorities.  I came from the National Economic Dialogue this morning in Dublin Castle where Government is engaging with unions, employers, NGOs, charities and academic experts.  It will run all day today and tomorrow and Cabinet Ministers will attend it over the next two days.  It is an initiative Deputy Howlin was involved in establishing when he was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is one worth continuing because we want an open dialogue on budget priorities.  That is exactly what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  Where I differ with Deputy Howlin is I think it should be obvious to everyone that the best way to reduce debt is first to stop borrowing and after that to run a surplus and run some of that surplus to pay down the debt.  The truth is we are still borrowing.  This year we will spend more than we raise in taxation.  Even next year, where we are targeting a budget deficit of 0.1% of GDP, we will still spend more than we raise in taxation.  That is not sustainable.  We are in a situation in which the economy is growing strongly and where we are heading for full employment.  We should, like other small countries such as the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which are doing well economically, be getting to the point where we are running a surplus.  Our national debt is falling as a percentage of GDP but it needs to fall faster.  When we went into the last financial crisis just over ten years ago, our national debt was &euro;15,000 per person.  Today it is &euro;45,000 per person.  That means that ten or 15 years after the financial crisis our national debt per head is three times what it was back in 2007.  That is major risk.  We have an opportunity now to break the boom-bust cycle, not to repeat the mistakes of the past and not to sign up the philosophy of \"When I have it, I spend it and when I do not, I borrow it.\"  We have an opportunity now to break the cycle of boom and bust and not to repeat the mistakes of the past.  In our view that means balancing the budget next year, running a deficit of roughly 0.1% of GDP, and in the year after that running to a surplus and using that to pay down our debt so if we ever enter another financial crisis, downturn or recession, we will not have to make the kind of painful decisions that were made during the lost decade I spoke about.  It may not be politically popular.  I am sure there are way more votes in cutting taxes and ramping up spending but we will do the right thing because we are much more interested in the next generation than we are in the next election.<\/p>  <p>  I reassure the Deputy that we have set out a plan to invest &euro;116 billion over the next ten years in our public infrastructure, healthcare, housing, tackling climate change, new schools and social infrastructure which we both agree is so important.  We are not waiting for ten years to do it.  If we compare this period with the same period last year, there has been an 18% increase in capital spending.  That is 18% more spent on our public infrastructure.  Next year we will increase it by another 25%, going from a country that is a low spender on public infrastructure to one of the highest spenders in public infrastructure in the coming years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700014#M00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1530098100,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did exactly what I expected him to do.

We can argue about whether GDP is appropriate but the Taoiseach used the figure.  We are now in the medium-50s in terms of our indebtedness.  We now have the capacity to address the big social deficits we have in education and health and elsewhere to allow our economy to grow.  If the economy grows, the level of debt falls.

What is provided is heteronormative and gender normative sex education where only reproductive intercourse is mentioned and where trans people and non-binary people simply do not exist.  <\/p><p>We have been inundated with school students contacting us about their inadequate sex education.  Courtney told us that her education \"only focused on heterosexual relationships.  They mentioned bisexuals once when they asked did we think they were greedy.\"  Eighty seven per cent of school students surveyed felt that LGBTQ+ relationships were not discussed sufficiently in their RSE.  That is because of an outdated curriculum but fundamentally it is because of church control of our schools, and the religious ethos of those schools taking precedence over the rights of students to have access to necessary information.  That religious ethos provision in the Education Act 1998 will stand in the way of even the best curriculum in the world being delivered to school students.  It is yet another illustration of why we need separation of church and State.<\/p> <p> The impact of this on the mental health of young people is obvious.  Where they are erased or othered, it contributes to an atmosphere where bullying is more likely, where young people feel pressured to hide to their identity and, shockingly, according to one study, where one in three young LGBT people has attempted to take their life.  We need factual progressive sex education, which is LGBTQ+ positive, not gender normative and which centres consent.  That is what the Citizens' Assembly called for.  It is what the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution recommended and the D&aacute;il voted for in April when it passed Second Stage of the Objective Sex Education Bill 2018.  Crucially, that Bill would amend the Education Act to ensure that it would be delivered regardless of the religious ethos of the school.  Despite that vote, however, we have a problem.  The Ceann Comhairle has decided that the Bill would require incidental expenses and, therefore, to proceed to Committee Stage, we need the Taoiseach to sign a money message.  I presume he will be there on Saturday.  Will he be able to tell the crowd that he is allowing this Bill to continue to Committee Stage so that we can have necessary LGBTQ+ positive sex education in our schools, or will he have to explain why he is undemocratically using a money message to block the Bill and standing in the way of the change we need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700014#M01700","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530098700,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I reassure the Deputy that far from standing in the way of change once again the Government is making change happen.  This is an important matter, which we broadly agree on.  We agree on the importance of our children and young people receiving age appropriate, up-to-date information relating to their sexual health.  The question is how we best go about making that change happen.  Is it through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which we have used for decades to set curriculums for subjects, or through primary legislation?  We do not have primary legislation saying what should be on the history, physics or mathematics curricula.  Primary legislation is not the correct approach to changing a school curriculum.  It is best done the way we have been doing it successfully for decades, through the NCCA.<\/p>  <p>  We have asked for a major review of relationship and sexuality education and this is under way.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, announced it last April.  As some aspects of the curriculum are 20 years old, we believe that now is the time to carry out a major reform.  On its content, the Minister has specifically tasked the NCCA with considering a few areas in conducting its evaluation.  These include: consent, which is so important and widely discussed now, what it means and its importance; developments in contraception; healthy positive sexual expression and relationships; the safe use of the Internet for all sorts of reasons that we understand; social media and its effect on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ issues.  The NCCA has been asked to do that to ensure that we have a modern curriculum and that we can make these reforms and implement them in schools.  I strongly believe this is the right approach.  This is the way we should make change happen and we should not start legislating for curricula in our schools.  That is a different approach and a rather sinister one that does not tend to happen in democratic countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700015#N00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1530098700,"counter":182,"content":"<p>That is disappointing and extremely disingenuous because the Taoiseach knows that the Bill that passed Second Stage with his Government's agreement does not prescribe a curriculum.

Does the Taoiseach not accept that it is possible to have the best curriculum in the world but because of the characteristic spirit of the schools and how that is protected by the Education Act 1998 they are under no obligation to teach it?  A student in a maths class is not prevented from learning multiplication because it is against the school's religion.  A student who is LGBTQ+ should have their identity recognised when they go to school, regardless of the religious ethos.

The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, is throwing around all sorts of figures and arguments in respect of this matter but no one knows what he is saying.  We need to debate the Bill to which I refer, which is a core measure in the context of tackling the recycling issue.  That is one of the many environmental issues which we need to tackle and which the Taoiseach completely ignored this morning.  Will the Taoiseach issue the money message and allow us to debate the Waste Reduction Bill and try to restore some kind of reputation for this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700016#O01900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1530099300,"counter":223,"content":"<p>The House will appreciate that no matter a long a speech one makes, there will always be something that one either does not mention or does not mention enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700016#O02000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1530099300,"counter":224,"content":"<p>It is a small thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700016#O02100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1530099300,"counter":225,"content":"<p>That is a standard criticism of any speech that anyone makes.

He is doing this at a time when people claiming to represent Europe's Christian heritage are promoting a deep intolerance.  We can look at what is happening in Hungary and the commentary from political leaders in some European Union member states, which is a cause for real concern.  Ireland's representatives did not attend the weekend's mini-summit but this week's European Council will address the matter of migration in detail.

That is positive.  The Pope has also spoken positively about the need to address global poverty and on behalf of the people of Palestine.  We should be respectful of the visit and the celebration of those who are of that faith.  However, it is also important that this would not prevent us from asking important questions of the Vatican.  The questions that matter most to people who felt they have been hurt by the church and its role in the likes of the adoption scandals and particularly in clerical abuse relate to the Vatican files on what it knew, when it knew and what it did about reports of clerical sex abuse.  That is terribly important.  The survivors and victims of clerical sex abuse deserve that and we must ask those hard questions.

Will the Taoiseach give us details of the budget allocated in respect of the reinstatement of the Phoenix Park after the Pope's visit?  There will be 600,000 people in the park and that will put enormous pressure on the ecosystem.  We have seen recently what happened with two very successful events, the Ed Sheeran concerts and the Bloom festival, which involved fractions of the number of people going to see the Pope.  Has a budget been tied down to reinstate the park?<\/p>  <p>  Second, I refer to the Taoiseach's interaction with Pope Francis when he arrives.  Will the Taoiseach raise the matters that have caused such grave scandal in Ireland generally and particularly in the Catholic Church relating to its treatment of different groups of people?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that when the Pope visited Ireland previously, the visitors stayed in the nunciature at the Navan Road?  Barely a stone's throw from that nunciature is St. Patrick's Home on the Navan Road, which was one of the largest mother and baby homes in Europe.  It probably has a significant history connected to the adoption scandal Members have discussed in recent weeks.  Between 2,000 and 2,500 babies in Glasnevin Cemetery died in that home, or at least they are the burials we know of.  There are people who stand, week in and week out, at the gates of Leinster House.  These are a number of women who were in St. Patrick's Home and still feel enormous hurt, as many do because of what happened to them in that home.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach raise this matter with the Pope?  He could tell Catholic parishes all over the country to open up and welcome back people who may have been given up for adoption out of their parishes.  He is a man who has sought to reach out to people in difficulty.  He would welcome such an approach from the Taoiseach that would provide some level of both recognition and healing for many wrongs done to many different people.  In particular, could the Pope lay a few flowers at St. Patrick's Home on the Navan Road?

Anyway, I am glad that the Pope will be getting out of Dublin and will be visiting the basilica at Knock and saying mass there.<br\/><br\/>I am not involved, nor is my office, in organising any delegations or deputations to meet Pope Francis.  That would have to be done through the Papal Nuncio.  My role will be very limited.

None of that has been worked out yet, but certainly I will use the opportunity to welcome him to Ireland on behalf of the people and I think he will be most welcome in Ireland.  I will use the opportunity to raise issues of historical abuse against our citizens by church authorities.  I think people would expect me to raise them at such a meeting.<br\/><br\/>We do not have a cost or budget yet either for the security or for the reinstatement of the park, but we estimate it will be in the same ballpark as Queen Elizabeth's visit.  In other words, it will probably be more than &euro;10 million and less than &euro;20 million but that is only an estimate at this stage.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Martin mentioned the fact that some people have been applying for tickets that they do not intend to use as some sort of protest.  I firmly believe that such actions, if they are happening, are wrong, petty and mean-spirited.  Protest is legitimate and okay, but denying other people the opportunity to attend a mass or an event is not legitimate protest in my view and is most unfair.  It should be condemned.<br\/><br\/>I was asked a question around migration.  The position the Government takes is that migration is a classic example of why we need multilateralism and bodies like the European Union.  No country on its own can deal with migration.  Countries that act unilaterally simply pass the problems and difficulties on to the next country.  We need a European approach.  That involves co-operation with the source countries and transit countries to reduce the push factors.  People are leaving countries because they are unsafe, because they are badly governed and because there are no economic opportunities there.  Europe needs to do far more in the Middle East and Africa to bring about security, political freedom and economic opportunity so that fewer people feel forced to migrate.<br\/><br\/>Enhanced border security is important.  We already have a role with Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean.  Europe as a whole will need to do more to protect its seas and borders.  Nation states are simply unable to do that anymore.  We need to protect our external frontier.<br\/><br\/>Burden sharing is also important.  We are committed to burden sharing and solidarity when it comes to the migration crisis.  We are asking all the time for other European countries to demonstrate solidarity for us when it comes to Brexit.  Therefore, when it comes to problems they face, such as mass migration or illegal migration, we have to assist them as well.  That is why we took the decision yesterday, after a request from the Maltese Prime Minister, that we would take 25 migrants from <i>MV Lifeline<\/i>and we have agreed to do that.  They will be part of the 4,000 that we have already committed to.  Only approximately 2,000 of the 4,000 have so far arrived in Ireland.

For that reason, we must address some matters.<\/p><p>As I have said in the past, the role of churches in controlling education is a very important issue so that all faith communities and none will have access to appropriate education and faith training but all have a common curriculum.  We touched upon this earlier.  If one reads the history of countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands or France, a separation of new migrants from indigenous communities has caused huge problems.  Often, after generations, there are people who do not even speak the main language of the country.  Separateness is encouraged.  We need to think very carefully and have an inclusive curriculum and understanding of what Irishness involves, with a full respect for the expression of religious beliefs and a capacity for religious training in that.  One suggestion I made on this matter is that it might be appropriate for the Citizens' Assembly to look at the provision of education into the future to address different demands in order that we do not have demands in the future for particular types of religious education that might be seen as excluding people from mainstream education.  It is something that we should have regard to and I would be interested to hear whether these were the types of issues which were touched upon by the Taoiseach in his dialogue with religious leaders of all faiths.  The pre-eminence or dominance of one faith in this State, namely, the Catholic faith, is changing.  It is anxious to divest some of its schools to allow for a different tapestry of provision.  I am interested to hear the Taoiseach's view on this issue.

There is no doubt in my mind that that is the majority opinion by a significant margin in this country now.  That message must be taken on board and the churches, and particularly the Catholic Church, need to understand that.  That means that we have to move towards the complete separation of church and State in the management of our schools and hospitals.  It is simply not acceptable that the religious persuasion of particular schools or school patrons would, for example, influence sex education when it is such an important matter.  It involves issues such as consent, contraception and abortion, all things that young people have a right to know and the State has an obligation to teach in an objective manner.  It is not acceptable that the religious views of a patron body would impact and prevent pupils being educated on those things.  Furthermore, it is not acceptable that as we speak, religious patrons such as the Christian Brothers are flogging off school property to bolster their own finances at the expense of school children and school facilities.  Nor is it acceptable that there be any question marks over what kind of medical treatment might be available to people in hospitals because the religious persuasion of hospital patron bodies might impact on the services those hospitals are willing to deliver.

The last initiative to dramatically change the dynamic of school formation was a decision I took myself in the late 1990s to eliminate the local contribution which was necessary when trying to build a new school.  That was a big barrier to Educate Together schools, especially, in Dublin and other cities, in affording land prices and so on.  Educate Together has always instanced that as a significant milestone in enabling it to build new schools.<\/p><p>It is now seven years since the Government, of which the Taoiseach was a member, announced that 1,500 schools were to change patronage beginning in January 2012.  It is also seven years since that same Government convened a commission on school patronage.  By any measure, there has been a failure to deliver on the revolutionary rhetoric and very little has been achieved on this front.  This is causing frustration in many areas.  Many schools are concerned about uncertainty and in the one or two examples where divestment happened, the changeover has not been that effective as some Educate Together schools are now reporting to CEIST or some other body.  That jars with what ought to be the case.  The Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, has said again that he believes the majority of schools under his patronage should be divested.

Almost all were the product of public donations rather than the private contributions of those orders.  The public of 100 years ago gave donations to buy the church lands and to build the church institutions.  I am concerned that an air of enormous fragility now attaches to those properties and lands, particularly because of what has happened in a number of recent cases in which different orders have moved to sell off playing fields used by schools.  That is not good enough in terms of religious bodies having an active and ethical citizenship in our country.  They are privileged to meet the Taoiseach but they see themselves as private property owners and consider how they deal with their private property, which was previously donated by the public, as their private business.  I have attended those meetings and I would like to think that the Taoiseach would have the courage to raise these fundamental issues about what are public assets, if one looks at it in a broad historical context, the ownership of which, however, may legally rest with a particular order.

I engaged with them a lot as Minister for Social Protection.  For that reason I thought it was appropriate for them to be there to have input into policies, particularly those around welfare and housing.  The Minister, Deputy Doherty, was not there because of anything to do with schools; it was to do with policies on employment, welfare, housing and so on.

It might add another dimension to the meeting were she to be there.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brendan Howlin made a valid point on schools and ensuring that the schools system we have, which involves different forms of patronage, does not give rise to segregation.  We do see elements of that.  There is certain element of it in my constituency.  There may be a Catholic parish school close to an Educate Together national school or a community national school.  The Catholic parish school would tend to have large numbers of children who come from ethnic Irish backgrounds while one might see a much higher proportion of children from Poland or from African backgrounds in the community national school or the Educate Together school.  I can see how that could become a problem in the future.  That is why the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 is so important.  I am keen to get that through and to get it implemented on the ground.  We intend to accelerate the divestment programme.  The vast majority of new schools being built also tend to be Educate Together schools, education and training board, ETB, schools or Gaelscoileanna.  There are still some new Catholic schools but far fewer.<\/p>  <p>  On divestment, an analysis was conducted of primary school parental preferences in 2012 and 2013.  It indicated that there was sufficient parental demand to support immediate changes in school patronage in 28 areas.  The main patron, the Catholic bishop or archbishop in each of these 28 areas, was asked to consider divestment options that would free up school accommodation for the provision of education by the first-choice alternative patron.  Ten new schools have opened under the patron divestment process.  The pace of progress under this process has, however, been far too slow.  As a result, the Minister for Education and Skills announced new plans on 30 January which are aimed at providing more multidenominational and non-denominational schools throughout the country in line with the choices of families and schools communities and the programme for Government's commitment in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that people want the separation of church and state.  They have wanted it for some time.  However, I do not necessarily think that separating church and state is the same as absolute secularism.  People may want the church and the State to be separated, but that does not necessarily mean that they want religious or religious inspired bodies to be driven out of education or welfare entirely.  There is a difference between a separation of the church and the State and extreme secularism.  The public is probably somewhere in between on that issue.  <\/p>  <p>  For example, people want to have a choice when it comes to education.  Many parents want to send their kids to the local parish school.  They want their kids to have their first communion in the school with the other kids in the class.  They do not have a problem with that.  Rather than forcing a change on people that they do not want, we should respect parental choice in education, ask parents what type of school they want and do our best to accommodate that.  It is easier to do in urban areas, where people may be near to a number of schools, than in rural areas but that is the approach we should take rather than the forced secularisation of schools against the wishes of parents, which would not be right.  The same applies to freedom of religion.  If religious bodies are willing to get involved in helping to provide welfare, housing and emergency accommodation - as they do at the homeless hub in the Mater Dei Institute, for example - we should welcome them as partners and not tell them to go away because they are religious.  That type of secularism is not the type of secularism people want.  They do, however, want a separation of church and state.<\/p>  <p>  The only point I would make on healthcare would be around volunteerism.  As other Members have pointed out, it is not appropriate any more for churches, or even lay trusts, to own and control major public hospitals that are funded by the State to the value of hundreds of millions of euros.  However, we need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater in making our reforms.  If one looks at the three maternity hospitals in Dublin, they are all voluntary, as are the Mater and St. Vincent's.  These are often the best run hospitals because they have their own boards and they have a tradition, an ethos and a pride in their institutions.  They are much less likely to pass a problem on, which would be much more common in HSE-run hospitals.  It may be possible to retain that voluntary ethic in a secular way.  Notwithstanding its name, St. James's is an example of how that can be done.  The new national children's hospital is being established as a voluntary hospital but not a religious one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700023#V00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1530104100,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Could I make a suggestion?

I will also attend a meeting of the European Council in its Article 50 format and a eurozone summit.  The meeting of the European Council proper on Thursday will focus on security and defence, migration, jobs, growth and competitiveness, innovation and digital issues, the multi-annual financial framework, and external relations.  It is a heavy agenda.  On Friday morning, we will meet in Article 50 format to discuss the Brexit negotiations.  After that, there will be a Euro summit that will focus on the deepening of economic and monetary union.  I will focus my remarks on Brexit and on some of the other issues of particular significance for Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will speak about the other European Council issues in greater detail in her statement.<\/p>  <p>  Our discussions on Brexit on Friday morning will be based on an assessment from Mr. Michel Barnier on progress since the March European Council.  He will report that there has been some progress on elements of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement, including on areas such as VAT, EURATOM and certificates for goods.  He will also make it clear that serious divergences remain on Irish issues, regarding which there has been no substantial progress since March.<\/p>  <p>  The UK entered into commitments in December.  It agreed that the withdrawal agreement will set out the legal terms on which it will leave the EU.  It agreed that it must contain a legally operative backstop to avoid a hard border on this island.  This commitment was restated in writing in March.  On 7 June, the UK presented a technical paper on a temporary customs arrangement between it and the EU.  It has suggested that this arrangement would apply after the proposed period of transition if it were needed to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland.  While it is positive that there is now a written proposal from the British Government, the paper itself acknowledges that an arrangement for customs is only part of the solution.  Arrangements on regulatory alignment will also be required.  Furthermore, the proposal had fundamental shortcomings, including the suggestion that the arrangement could be time limited.  Having studied the paper, the Commission has identified numerous issues regarding the proposal's legal and technical viability, and its fundamental incompatibility with the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.<\/p>  <p>  In presenting his views on the state of play in the negotiations, the Union's negotiator has said that the UK must deliver on its commitments in full.  The withdrawal agreement must contain a fully operational backstop for Ireland and Northern Ireland.  He has stated his belief that a lot more work needs to be done if there is to be an agreement by October. <\/p>  <p>  When the T&aacute;naiste and I met with the European Commission President, Mr. Jean Claude Juncker, and Mr. Michel Barnier last Thursday, we were all in complete agreement in our assessment that serious divergences persist.  As I said in my remarks after the meeting &ndash; and I put it bluntly &ndash; there is not much time left if we are to conclude an agreement in October and have it ratified by the European Parliament and UK Parliament in time for the UK's departure in March.  The Irish Government and the Union's negotiators have said that there is an urgent need to intensify efforts and negotiations.  We should all be in no doubt that, without a backstop, there will be no withdrawal agreement and that without a withdrawal agreement there will be no period of transition for the UK.  As a result, the choice for it is stark.  That is what I will be saying when I update European Council colleagues this week.  I expect that the European Council will send a message to the UK.  Negotiations on the withdrawal agreement can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.<\/p>  <p>  The Government hopes that it will also be possible to set out in detail the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK alongside the withdrawal agreement.  As we have always said, we hope that this can be as close and comprehensive as possible, and we hope that it will remove any need for a hard border, not just between the North and South but also between the east and west.  However, it will not in any way remove the need for a legally robust backstop to apply unless and until better arrangements enter into force, ensuring that there will never be a hard border on this island, whatever circumstances prevail.<\/p>  <p>  In the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, the EU has put its version of a viable backstop on the table.  It is entirely in line with the agreement reached between the EU and the UK last December.  The UK acknowledges now that it needs to engage fully on this text.<\/p>  <p>  Our EU partners remain steadfast in their support of Ireland, something for which we are profoundly grateful.  At our meeting in Dublin on Thursday last, President Juncker reiterated that the EU is fully behind Ireland in the negotiations and that this will not change.  That message was also clear in my telephone conversation with President Tusk last Thursday.  Our partners are absolutely determined to avoid any situation in which Ireland would be isolated.  Indeed, Ireland's concerns are at the very heart of the negotiations.  Ireland's interests are seen and felt as EU interests, as President Juncker said.<\/p>  <p>  Irish issues are not the only ones that remain outstanding.  Other very important issues remain open, including, crucially, the governance of the withdrawal agreement, and the role of the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  Now there will have to be renewed and intensified efforts to resolve all the outstanding issues, including the backstop.  Work should also be accelerated on the framework for the future relationship between the EU and UK.  Here, again, the UK needs to provide written proposals if we are to make progress.  While I am hopeful that we will achieve a close, comprehensive and ambitious future relationship with the UK, the Government is, of course, continuing to plan for the full range of scenarios.  I expect that the European Council will urge all member states to do likewise at its meeting this week.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to other issues, migration continues to be a priority concern for the Union, and we will exchange views on the progress achieved to date in our comprehensive response to mass migration and on our plans for the future.<\/p>  <p>  While there has been some progress on overall EU policies, it is no secret that there are differences of opinion between member states, particularly on to how to manage the issue internally.  A breakthrough at the European Council is not impossible but it is considered very unlikely at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has sought to play a constructive role in discussions on migration and to be an active and pragmatic partner.  We opted in to the EU relocation and resettlement measures in 2015 and we provided a series of fully crewed naval vessels to assist with humanitarian search-and-rescue efforts in the Mediterranean.  We have substantially increased our humanitarian assistance to relevant regions.  We should continue to play an active and constructive role on this issue.  It is an issue that is too big for individual nation states and that can only be solved collectively.<\/p>  <p>  We need to strengthen the Union's external borders.  We also need to work actively with partners, including in Africa, to drive political and economic development so people can have security, good governance and economic opportunities.  Finally, we need to find a means to respond to the question internally, in a spirit of fairness and solidarity.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the heading of jobs, growth and competitiveness, we will discuss the country-specific recommendations, digital taxation and trade.  We had a useful exchange on digital taxation at our leaders' agenda meeting in March and, as agreed at the time, conclusions on the issue will now be adopted.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that Ireland is fully committed to global tax reform.  We do not accept that companies should pay little or no tax on their profits.  This, however, is a global issue, which therefore requires a global solution.  We need to ensure that tax is paid by companies where value is created, not simply where a transaction happens.  Unilateral EU action on this basis would damage EU competitiveness and disadvantage smaller member states and exporters.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission has recommended a short-term temporary tax on certain limited digital tax activities in advance of more extensive taxation measures in the future.  Along with several other EU member states, we have urged caution around any short-term measure.  We need solutions that are workable and sustainable in the long term.  I believe strongly that the OECD is the best forum for making progress on this because it needs the widest possible international consensus.  We will, of course, continue to engage constructively with the EU, in addition to the OECD, in the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  On trade, I strongly oppose the US Administration's decision to apply tariffs on steel and aluminium.  These are not justifiable on the grounds of national security.  I fully support the Commission's approach of proportionate rebalancing and safeguarding measures, along with legal proceedings at the World Trade Organization, WTO.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to maintain a positive trade agenda at the European Council, however.  I expect the European Council to call for the Union to continue to negotiate ambitious, balanced and mutually beneficial trade agreements with partners across the world, including Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Latin America.  This is something that I welcome and that is very much in Ireland's interests.<\/p>  <p>  On security and defence, which comprise another priority for many partners, we will examine many areas, including permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, military mobility, the European Defence Fund, the defence industrial development programme and co-operation with NATO, as well as work undertaken to strengthen civilian Common Security and Defence Policy.<\/p><p>Partners are respectful of Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality in these discussions.  We are founding members of PESCO and support greater EU-NATO co-operation where it contributes to international peace and security.  This ensures better coherence and effectiveness on the ground in peace support and crisis management operations.<\/p> <p> The euro summit meeting on Friday morning will take place in its inclusive format, that is,  with all 27 member states and will focus on economic and monetary union, EMU.  The main issues will relate to banking union, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and proposals for establishing a budget for the eurozone.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we support the completion of a banking union as soon as practicable with appropriate risk reduction and risk-sharing measures.  We can support the ESM as the backstop to the Single Resolution Fund.  I expect agreement on this will be difficult, however.<\/p> <p> I note the interest in establishing a budget for the eurozone.  The intention is to task finance Ministers to examine the proposals carefully with a view to returning to these matters at the December European Council.  One would have to know whether a eurozone budget would require additional contributions from Irish taxpayers, how much and what taxes, where will it come from, how much would it be, how it would be spent and whether it would be compatible for the eurozone and the EU to have separate budgets.  These issues need to be teased out clearly.  We need to have those questions answered before we can commit to supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700024#W00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530104700,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Did the Taoiseach write a letter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700025#X00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1530104700,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will speak on the other issues on the agenda of the European Council including innovation and digital, the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and external relations.<\/p><p>I look forward to engaging with my EU colleagues at the European Council, while always keeping in mind the best interests of Ireland and Europe.<\/p><p>I look forward to reporting back to the House on 4 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700025#X00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1530104700,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I note the Taoiseach is a bit more informed today about the eurozone budget proposals than he was yesterday.  That is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  This week's summit was due to mark a moment of significant progress on Brexit.  Unfortunately, this will not now happen.  For Ireland, many warning signals are now going off which suggests that, at best, meeting our negotiating objectives will be extremely difficult.  Given the scale of how important this is, I will use this brief statement to focus solely on Brexit.  My colleagues will address the other important issues on the Council's agenda during their contributions.<\/p>  <p>  It is now over two years since the Brexit referendum and over six months since the political text was agreed.  Then the Taoiseach said, in an obviously euphoric mood, \"We have achieved all we set out to achieve\".  The reality of the situation today, however, is that the only agreed text regarding Ireland concerns matters which were never actually in doubt.  What has been agreed are points which were found in negotiating positions produced by both sides in the first half of last year.  A deadline, which we were repeatedly told was central to the achievement of Ireland's objectives, will now be missed this week.  The draft conclusions for the summit state clearly \"No substantial progress has yet been achieved\".<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s tactic, however, is to throw a few digs at London and hope that nobody notices that its negotiating strategy is, at best, in deep trouble.  There are major questions which must be asked.  What exactly is the current status of the negotiations on Ireland?  What will the Government do to change a dangerous dynamic which may lead to a poor outcome later this year?<\/p>  <p>  One of the problems in talking about Brexit has been the shift over the past year to a situation where the bulk of coverage in our media is dominated by official briefings.  There has been very little tough questioning of the Government and no real attempt to ask our leaders to reconcile obvious contradictions in their positions.  At the political level, what had been an open approach to discussions with other pro-EU parties on this issue changed completely in the middle of last year.  In place of dialogue, we have seen a remarkable level of arrogance and a demand that other parties shut up and toe the line.  In fact, there has been growing evidence of a Government which is willing to play cynical political games with Brexit, even going as far as to try to talk up the supposed instability of its negotiating mandate.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael&rsquo;s leaked research and its always industrious briefers confirm the Taoiseach wants to engineer a way of recreating the wave of uncritical support he received after last December's agreement.  My party will not let this messing by the Government distract from the hard substance of the challenge which Brexit poses to Ireland, as well as the need for clarity about what Ireland is seeking and believes is a credible outcome.<\/p>  <p>  The position today is less clear than at any stage since early last year.  The simple and hard fact is that the Government spent six months saying June was a critical moment when we had to see substantial agreement on Ireland&rsquo;s specific proposals.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy had two main tactical objectives from the beginning.  First, that Ireland would not still be on the table when the final status element of the withdrawal treaty was being discussed.  Second, that we would support the United Kingdom if it tried to find a back door to continued access to the customs union and Single Market.  Both of these tactical manoeuvres have failed, however, leaving us in a deeply uncertain position.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has taken to claiming that he always insisted that June was not a deadline.  The record shows this is, however, simply not the case.  The record of the House is full of his statements saying progress was required by June in order for there to be a deal.  Separately, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 16 March said Ireland was putting down a marker for June.  On 29 April, he said that Ireland would not allow negotiations to move forward without clear signals of a solution and \"we need to see substantial progress in June\".  On 14 May, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said Ireland certainly needed to see a solution on the backstop taking shape by the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  It is possible to go on with similar quotes, demonstrating that June was indicated as a decisive date for Ireland by our own Government.  In fact, the Government went further than this at one stage.  On 12 December, as well as in various media appearances afterwards, both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said the phase 2 talks would be suspended if there was any attempt by the United Kingdom at backsliding on the backstop agreement.  It has attempted to backslide.  The June deadline has been missed and no significant progress has been made.  In these circumstances, the very least the Government owes the D&aacute;il and the people is an honest explanation for what this means and why it has decided not to follow through on its loud and repeated threats.  No party on this side of the House has called for a suspension of the talks at any time.  The Government, however, has threatened to do so.  It needs to explain why it is backing off.  It is not good enough for the Government to effectively try to cough into its hand, have another go at the Brits and hope people have not noticed it has just missed its own key deadline.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Government issued yet another official update on Brexit developments.  It included a range of reports and six photographs of the Taoiseach.  It contained no mention, whatsoever, of this week's summit and the missed deadline.  Fundamentally, the Brexit mess is purely the creation of a particular class of English politician for whom self-regard and a disinterest in facts has elevated prejudice to the level of ideology.  They have turned their country from the fastest-growing economy in Europe to the slowest and have already reduced the national income by an estimated &pound;400 million a week.  They have been as incompetent and incoherent as it is possible to be.<\/p>  <p>  This does not absolve our Government from its responsibility to be open about the status of the negotiations, the increasing risk of new barriers to trade and what appears a complete breakdown in political level contacts with London on this issue.  We also need the Government to have the honesty to admit that it may have wasted months in the hope that London could use the backstop as a way to reverse the United Kingdom as a whole into the customs union and Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  This was the proposal made earlier this month by the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May.  When the Taoiseach was briefed by her about it he welcomed it as progress.  However, he has been distancing himself from it since Michel Barnier rejected it as unacceptable cherry-picking that endangers the European Union's legal order.  I know the Taoiseach denies this but the record shows he has supported this option for some time.  In a written statement he released on 8 December, when praising himself for achieving \"all we set out to achieve\", he explicitly stated, \"So there is a backstop arrangement in which Northern Ireland and perhaps all the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union\".<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach himself supported the use of the backstop for the whole of the United Kingdom.  It was proposed by the United Kingdom but has now been rejected, involving a waste of scarce time in the process.<\/p><p>The backstop was sold by the Taoiseach, to quote just a few of the descriptions he has used, as \"bulletproof\", \"concrete\", \"cast-iron\" and \"rock-solid\", yet six months on there has been no progress on turning it into an agreed legal text or in reconciling the Taoiseach's interpretation of the backstop with the claim he made on 8 December that there would be no new barriers between Northern Ireland and Britain.<\/p> <p> Following passage of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill last week in Westminster, Brexit is for the first time a legal fact in British law.  There appears to be no reasonable scenario whereby it can be reversed and Brexiteers now have a stronger hand.  Equally, there are 39 billion reasons to believe that the momentum for a withdrawal treaty is unstoppable.  Given how Ireland cried wolf about suspending the negotiations if London tried to backslide, we must assume our Government accepts this.<\/p> <p> What is the dynamic which has taken a non-productive strategy over the past six months and delivers a new impetus behind the type of deal we were told was already in the bag last December?  Is it really the Taoiseach's position that our Government can go through this process without proposing anything concrete?  Do we really have no proposals as to how continued free trade would work on this island?  Unless something serious is done, the final status paper the United Kingdom Government is to produce will be the new focus of negotiations and will confirm that Ireland is directly linked to this wider issue.  We need this summit to mark the end of a period of tough talk matched by ongoing drift.  We need our Government to put aside the spin and be direct and honest about how it believes this process can reasonably end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700025#X00400","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530105300,"counter":351,"content":"<p>My comments will relate particularly to the Friday meeting in Article 50 format and the issue of Brexit.  This Council meeting is crunch time, as I have said to the Taoiseach before.  We need to see realistic and workable solutions from the British Government as to how it proposes to avoid a hard border, uphold the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and ensure that citizens' rights in the North will be protected.  It is not accurate to say the Government has simply been throwing shapes at the British, as though to suggest that the burden of culpability lies on this side of the water.  I do not accept that.  British prevarication and the British Government's failure to come up with a solution in accordance with what it claims to be its policy is a fault of theirs, and it is important that is not lost in the midst of this debate.  June was set as a red-letter date and a deadline, and with good reason, and it is a mistake to allow that to slip.  There can be no question of negotiations moving to the next phase without the requisite guarantees coming from the British Government.  In fact, it would be negligent and disastrous for anyone to contemplate progress in the absence of a concrete answer to the Irish question.<\/p>  <p>  We have had our fill of Tory playacting and game-playing.  We have had enough doublespeak and dodging.  What we need now is clarity and certainty.  This needs to be put to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, in a direct and forthright manner by An Taoiseach at this meeting.  If, as we know will happen, the British Government fails to meet its responsibilities, then it needs to be called out because its position, as it stands, would mean a hard border, damage to our economy and the erection of barriers to east-west trade.  It would undermine the Good Friday Agreement - the House should be in no doubt about that - and crucial areas of cross-Border co-operation and would see the rights of Irish and European citizens cast aside.  Tall tales of frictionless borders and grandiose nonsense about buffer zones have been entertained for far too long.  It is now time to dial down the rhetoric and time for a little straight talking.  It is time for common sense, a common sense sorely lacking in the Tory analysis and strategy brought to bear so far.<\/p>  <p>  The British Prime Minister needs to understand that Ireland will not be the collateral damage in a Tory Brexit.  She also needs to be reminded that the North of Ireland voted to remain and that the British Government's denial of this vote is an affront to democracy and runs contrary to the consent principle enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  Brexit is Britain's problem, of their creation, not ours, and we will not be its casualties.  Irish jobs, Irish Industry, Irish rights and Irish peace agreements cannot be jeopardised to appease the Brexiteers.  It is the Taoiseach's duty and the duty of the Irish Government to stand up to the Tory sabre-rattling.  The Brexiteer bullies cannot be allowed to bully Ireland.  Their threats of the undoubted economic fallout for Ireland from Brexit are loudly mouthed by those who care little for this country, North or South, much less for our achievement of peace.  The manner in which they loudly glory in the harm they can do to their nearest neighbour is matched only by the self-harm they are intent on inflicting on their own country.  People who espouse the views encapsulated by Boris Johnson in his tirade at the weekend need to understand that we will not be threatened or intimidated by him.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government cannot be allowed to hide from its responsibilities, especially when it comes to the issue of the backstop.  Its tactic of playing for time while turning its face against the political agreement reached last December is not acceptable.  The backstop agreed in December is Ireland's insurance policy against the imposition of World Trade Organization, WTO, rules in the event of a no-deal scenario.  The British Government cannot be allowed to think that this backstop is now off the table, that somehow Ireland and the EU will buy the Alice in Wonderland notions it is selling, that it can scrap the December deal and that it can leave Ireland without any legal assurances.  The firm position of the Taoiseach and the Government must be that the December backstop is the bottom line, that the backstop is not and cannot be temporary and that it will not have a lifespan determined and set by the Tories.  The backstop is in fact the bare minimum.  We should regard it as the floor, not the ceiling, to be built upon.  It is an absolute essential in the absence, as I said, of a trade agreement.  The aim of the Irish Government at this meeting should be to secure a commitment from the British Government that it will honour, at a minimum, the deal as enunciated in December and that it will now provide the very necessary legally binding guarantees to that effect.<\/p>  <p>  To be clear, if the British Government refuses to give these assurances, we cannot wait until October to see if the sunshine and the improved mood of summer might help it to wise up.  Irish political leadership cannot slip into a summertime hibernation and then emerge wide-eyed in the autumn hoping for the best.  That is not a strategy.  That would be irresponsible.  We cannot sit back and allow the Tories to have the ball and dictate the course of play for the next three months.  The EU strategy must be shaped and informed by Irish thinking, by an Irish perspective on how to move things forward.  We need to initiate and to lead.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, must make it clear how they plan to respond if the British Government refuses to deliver these legally binding commitments.  What happens next?  We need a plan of action that spans the summer months.  It must involve, with all due respect, something more than shuttle diplomacy or a tour of capitals.  Otherwise, we run the real risk of Irish concerns being rolled into the EU's \"new relationship\" with Britain.  The House should make no mistake: such an outcome would be dangerous for Ireland.<\/p><p>It cannot be allowed to happen.  Make no mistake: it is the considered strategy of the British Government.  It is playing for time for precisely this reason.  Much is at stake and in the past two years we have had nothing but chaos and division from the British Government.  We have had two years of putting Ireland at risk economically, politically and socially.  Now is the time to draw a line in the sand and say, \"Enough is enough\".<\/p> <p> This meeting will be a serious and substantive test of the \"Ireland first\" position articulated by Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier, Jean Claude Juncker and our Government.  \"Ireland first\" cannot simply be sweet words whispered to assure the ears of the Irish public.  The Irish public do not want to be soothed; they want solutions, protection, security and guarantees.  In Brussels, &ldquo;Ireland first\" must ring emphatically in the ears of the British Prime Minister and her negotiating team.  They should be left in no doubt as to the absolute certainty of that position.  Those words must then be applied in both policy and action.  The EU and the Government must tell the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, that she has come this far but will not go any further without delivering credible solutions and without answering the Irish question.  It is as simple, straightforward and essential as this.<\/p> <p> I raised this matter when the European Commission President, Mr. Junker, addressed the Houses of the Oireachtas.  An annex to the backstop on the issue of citizens' rights was to be published.  It is within the gift of the EU through Mr. Barnier's task force to publish this annex.  I ask the Taoiseach, Mr. Barnier and the EU to publish that text without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700026#Y00200","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530105900,"counter":353,"content":"<p>This will mark the Taoiseach's fifth EU Council meeting.  It will also mark two years since the UK citizenry voted to leave the European Union.  Unfortunately, little progress has been made on addressing Ireland&rsquo;s core concerns to date.  The bulletproof backstop that was agreed last December has clearly now not been translated into an agreed legal text.  Talks on the future relationship between the UK and the EU were opened after the previous Council meeting without any such fallback being firmly and legally understood and in place.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is continually reassured of the solidarity of our fellow member states and of the EU leadership; we again heard it last week.  However, as others have said, we stand at a crossroads.  On 30 April addressing the civil dialogue in Dundalk, the Taoiseach said, \"Over the coming weeks, I hope and expect that we will see further progress in the negotiations on developing a close overall relationship between the EU and the UK, as well as on the necessary completion of the legal text on the backstop.\"  Sadly, two months on, that simply has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  A month ago, the Taoiseach said that the Government position was that progress had to be made by the June Council meeting.  The T&aacute;naiste also said there must be significant progress in advance of the June meeting.  Sadly, there has been no additional progress.  Now the delayed process will become incredibly compressed.  There is simply no time for further delay.<\/p>  <p>  The political challenge is to come up with creative solutions that are also robust.  I do not downplay or underestimate the challenges that that objective poses.  It is essential that the Government insist on a deadline for the UK to produce a backstop agreement on the Border.  It should be well in advance of the European Council meeting in October in order that we know exactly the position and so that Ireland is not pushed into a last-minute compromise that could fundamentally damage our interests.<\/p>  <p>  The ball is firmly in the Taoiseach's court, and he must now use the commitments and solidarity repeatedly expressed by our colleagues and co-member states to ensure a deadline is agreed well in advance of October.<\/p>  <p>  Last weekend the Taoiseach warned that a no-deal Brexit is now more likely.  The ongoing failure of the UK Government to arrive at a settled position even among itself to address the inconsistencies of its publicly stated red lines continues to drag down this entire process.  It is quite depressing to tune to some of the political commentary in Britain, as I did again this morning.  A fortnight ago, I spent the day in London meeting UK Labour Party parliamentary colleagues, organisations such as Open Britain and the most senior members of the Trades Union Congress in Britain.  I firmly believe the possibility is growing that the UK will crash out of the EU without a comprehensive deal.  This is not because of the position adopted by the EU at Ireland's behest, but because the internal dysfunction and blatant rivalries in the Conservative Party.  It makes the British Government incapable of making a deal or sticking to any stated position.<\/p>  <p>  The UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, won an important victory in the House of Commons on the exit Bill, but her Cabinet remains at war.  While it continues to negotiate with itself, the consequences of a hard Brexit for jobs in Ireland, particularly in the agrifood sector, will be catastrophic.<\/p>  <p>  The economic relationship between Ireland and Britain has shifted from one of historical dependence to one of mutual interdependence.  Nearly &pound;14 billion of goods are exported from Ireland to the UK, including an important percentage of the food that sustains the British people.  In turn, we import almost &pound;16 billion of UK goods into Ireland.  The customs union is what makes this trade possible.  No quotas, no tariffs and standardised regulations mean consignments do not need border controls or checks.  Ireland also exports &pound;16 billion of services to the UK, including from many multinationals based in Ireland.  Ireland buys &pound;10 billion of services from the UK.  The Single Market facilitates this through standards for services in different sectors, the free movement of money capital and workers, and the legal certainty for business provided by the common jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  Our trade represents over &pound;1 billion in goods and services every week and supports tens of thousands of jobs here.<\/p>  <p>  The uncertainty surrounding the final outcome of Brexit has led to financial companies and major industrial companies delaying investment or moving part of their activity out of the UK.  Major companies, for example in the motor industry, are taking the supply lines out of Britain.  We have heard of companies such as Airbus outline their concerns.  Anybody who speaks the truth is vilified in the British press.  It is hard to see how we can avoid having border infrastructure on the island of Ireland as well as border checks at British and Irish ports, if the UK remains outside the customs union and Single Market - or at least if a solution is not found for it to remain in close alignment with those institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The problem, of course, is that free trade depends on sharing the same set of regulations and standards on each side of a trade agreement.  All the UK Government's proposals to maintain the open border have been rejected by the EU, including Ireland.  This is not out of spite or wanting to punish anybody, but because they will not work to achieve frictionless trade.  We want free trade, North-South, and free trade, if it is possible to negotiate it, east-west.  However, we cannot have that free trade if the UK does not maintain the same standards as the European Union.  If the UK rolls back on regulation of the financial sector, it would undermine the level playing field for Irish financial services.  If the UK dilutes workers&rsquo; rights or environmental rights, this again will lead to new barriers being put in place.  Many of these regulations are the cornerstone of social Europe and the work of the Party of European Socialists over the decades.<\/p>  <p>  Following this summit, where it is now plain little or no progress will be made on these issues, the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, will hold a Cabinet meeting in Chequers next week.<\/p><p>Apparently, it will be a 24-hour marathon meeting to finalise a White Paper on its plans for a future relationship with the EU.  The emerging position of Mrs. May appears to be a form of maximum facilitation rather than a customs partnership, so it will leave the customs union in a manner demanded by the Brexiteers.  However, it could take a decade to develop those so-called easily available maximum facilitation arrangements, tying the UK to the customs union for all that time to maintain the backstop.<\/p> <p> On the Single Market, the UK will seek access for manufactured goods to maintain its industrial base and protect major employers like the car manufacturing industry.  Such an arrangement, if agreed with the EU, would smooth issues at the Border on our island but create enormous difficulties for our EU partners.  The UK would still diverge on services and, in this scenario, take EU rules on goods and likely be subject to the ECJ.  It is impossible to envisage how that set of proposals could be acceptable.  It remains implausible that the UK can negotiate a deal in the timeline that is now set out.  The notion that it could get a better deal with other trading blocs than is already available through the EU is fanciful, unless it determines to abandon social and environmental protections.  The time to make hard decisions is fast approaching.  There is also a growing campaign in the UK for a second vote on the outcome - whatever it might be - of the discussions.  It makes sense to me as a logical thing to do but it is a matter for the British.  The Council will also consider important reforms in other areas.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on the Brexit issue.  I have said for the past six months that it seems that the overarching position of the British Government is simply to hold together and say whatever is necessary at any given time for it to remain intact and for Prime Minister May to remain in office.  We have run out of rope on that strategy in terms of the positioning of Ireland.  I ask the Taoiseach to call out the British Government on that matter this weekend in order that we can get down to the nitty-gritty of hardcore discussions in the few months that are left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700027#Z00200","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530106500,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The world is watching what is happening in the US with horror as the attacks by Trump on migrants increase, with the upholding of the Muslim ban, the separation and caging of children of migrants and the speech he made to a Conservative PAC in recent days in which he compared migrants with snakes, thereby very clearly dehumanising them.  People are rightly horrified about that.  Migration will feature heavily at this meeting of the European Council.  The problem is that the same direction of travel is evident in what the EU and the governments of member states are doing.  The walls of fortress Europe are being built higher and higher.  They are being more militarised.  The treatment of those who make it to the EU is getting worse.  The consequence is that more people are dying in the Mediterranean.  One estimate said that since Salvini in Italy turned away the <i>Aquarius<\/i>, the number of those dying has increased by 20%.  The situation is symbolised by what is facing migrants on the <i>MV Lifeline<\/i>who are seeking to find a port, being rejected here, there and everywhere and being denied access for a period.  That comes on the back of the <i>Aquarius <\/i>and the <i>Alexander Maersk<\/i>being told there is no room at the inn by a series of European Governments.  Look at what Emmanuel Macron, who is supposedly a progressive figure and someone the Taoiseach looks up to, stated.  He condemned the German NGO and indicated the migrants should have been left to the mercy of the Libyan coastguard.  That is the Libyan coastguard which, according to the Irish office of Amnesty International, is intercepting people in distress at sea and transferring them to Libya where they are being held in detention centres and exposed to systematic and widespread human rights violations such as arbitrary detention, torture, rape and exploitation.<\/p><p>The policy of the European Union is the externalisation of Europe's borders, making deals with autocratic regimes in Turkey, Libya and elsewhere and the encouragement of human rights abuses to try to keep people away.  It is a policy that is copied by Trump.  The latter has externalised the American border by militarising the southern frontier with Mexico.  The results in terms of whether it works or not are in.  It has not reduced in any sense the number of migrants coming to the US but it has pushed people into taking more dangerous routes.  It has increased their vulnerability to trafficking and criminals of all sorts.  Exactly the same process happens in Europe by making migration more difficult.  We saw what happened in Italy with the leader of the Lega, Matteo Salvini, sickly calling for a registry of Roma and their expulsion.  We have the crisis in the German Government, the outcome of which will be a hardening of its line on migration.  We know which way this is pointing in terms of European policy.  It is reflected in the Meseberg Declaration of France and Germany.  The latter identifies three key areas on migration and asylum and calls for increased support and co-operation with origin and transit countries building on existing partnerships such as the EU-Turkey statement - that is, externalisation - avoid departures to Europe, fight illegal migration and speed up the process of return.  The declaration also refers to jointly and resolutely tackling secondary movements.  The Government has echoed that line in replies to parliamentary questions, etc.  That is clearly the direction in which it is pointing.<\/p><p>We need an end to fortress Europe.  We need to put a stop to the racist immigration controls that are applied.  The European Union and the countries that make it up also need to stop the policies that are responsible for or contribute very significantly to the crisis of migration.  They need to stop the imperialist intervention in the Middle East, which is responsible for a flood of human misery, and the trade policies based on maximising profits of European corporations at the expense of those people and their economies.  We need debt cancellations.  We need trade policies based on assistance and solidarity.  In short, we need socialist policies in Europe.  It is an indictment of the capitalist system that there are 60 million refugees across the world.  The way the capitalist governments of Europe and the EU treat them is a further indictment of that system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700028#AA00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1530106500,"counter":356,"content":"<p>\"Trump is a pig\" ran the banner at the Roger Waters gig last night in the 3Arena.  The audience at the gig erupted in applause and cheering when it saw the words emblazoned behind Roger Waters.  The visual imagery conveyed the horror of Trump's racist, anti-migrant policies, his plans for walls and his incarceration of children.  It was then followed by another banner that highlighted the rise of the far right across Europe, naming Orban in Hungary, Kurz in Austria, Le Pen in France, Farage in the UK and the Lega in Italy.  One can go through the frightening list of racist and, in some cases, openly fascist forces.  Deputy Paul Murphy is absolutely right to point to the fact, as Roger Waters did at the concert last night, that the horror of Trump is being echoed in the growth of terrifying far-right and racist forces across Europe.  This is impacting on the policies of the European Union in the creation of its own version of the racist wall and the vast expansion of fortress Europe, the budget of which will be multiplied by five between 2021 and 2027.<\/p><p>The previous budget for frontier officers, which was &euro;4 billion for the previous five years is now going up to &euro;25 billion.  There will be more officers to keep desperate migrants coming from North Africa, Syria and elsewhere out of Europe with the consequence that 35,000 men, women and children, including babies, have drowned in the Mediterranean because Europe, while often condemning Trump, rightly, is doing the same thing.  It is hatching agreements with authoritarian, brutal, despotic regimes in Libya and across the Middle East, co-operating with regimes such as the one in Egypt and so on, which are involved in vile policies that are creating the refugee crisis that is leading thousands of people in desperation to try to enter Europe from where they are repelled.  It worries me that in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s references to the discussions about what is to be discussed, he used the slightly sanitised language about the need for investment in maintaining Europe's external borders.  That is sanitised language for fortress Europe and for all those people who are drowning and for those rotten cynical deals with regimes such as that in Libya and others, which are treating human beings coming through their countries seeking asylum and sanctuary like animals and slaves.  They are abusing them, which is leading to the deaths of many.  <\/p> <p> The other theme highlighted by the Roger Waters concert, which is also relevant to the coming conference, was the plight of the Palestinian people and their treatment at the hands of Israel.  Waters has taken the very commendable stance of refusing to go to or to have concerts in Israel and has joined the international Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel because of its horrific treatment of the Palestinians.  The latest instance of this crisis, because of what Trump has done, is that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, budget is about to collapse so there may be no schools in Gaza and 5 million Palestinians who depend on that budget are now in serious trouble.  Save the Children has stated Gaza is now uninhabitable for many children.<\/p> <p> I warned the Taoiseach before the great return march took place that Palestinians would be killed, as more than 100 of them were.  I appealed to the Taoiseach to speak to his European colleagues about what Israel was planning to do.  Let me again warn him: on Tuesday, 3 July, women in Gaza will be marching demanding an end to the siege which is strangling their habitation and destroying the lives of their children.  They will be marching to demand the right to return, the right to justice and an end to the siege.  I hope we do not see another unleashing of ferocious attacks by Israel on women who will march next Tuesday but I appeal to the Taoiseach once again to raise the plight of the Palestinians and demand from his European counterparts that Europe does something instead of mouthing words of concern to alleviate the suffering and plight of the Palestinians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700028#AA00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530107100,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the upcoming Council meeting, which is important on several issues such as Brexit, migration and neutrality.  Even if we get everything we want through the Brexit deal, we will come out worse off because of the threats Europe is posing to our neutrality.  We will give away far more than we will gain if we continue on this road and if we do it in the unthinking and cavalier way that the Government is proceeding, supporting everything that is happening in Europe, not questioning anything and not allowing debate to take place here in Ireland where people could give their view on it.  This is because the Government is afraid of what people's views would be and does not want to have to go back to its masters in Europe with the message that we do not want to continue on the road that Europe is proceeding along in respect of neutrality and becoming a world power.  The Deputies who spoke before me were right to say we should be using our role within the EU to raise the issues and concerns about the Palestinians and migration with a strong voice instead of kowtowing, as we are, to Europe on the issues of neutrality, migration and ultimately Brexit too.  The Minister of State will say that is not right but we have seen that in the recent bailouts in Greece, Portugal and Spain, Europe insisted that these countries pay back their debts during the financial crisis but did not support cuts in military spending in any of those countries because France and Germany were the countries that were sending the military materiel to Spain, Greece and Portugal.  They wanted to make sure they got paid and they were promoting militarisation.<\/p>  <p>  Jean-Claude Juncker has called for a Europe with a security union, with the end goal of establishing a European army.  That is what we are participating in and are quite happy to go along with because the Minister of State will say that will never happen, we are not going to do that, we are participating only in what will protect our neutrality.  We all know that is rubbish.  We will be so far down the road that the Government will turn around and say, we are already in it so it does not matter.  <\/p>  <p>  We have to be proactive on immigration.  It is not enough for us to wait for a country to ask for assistance; we must put ourselves forward.  That is the way to counteract the right wing governments around Europe.  We can create a counterbalance by putting that forward and saying people have to be treated properly and with respect because those who come to Europe are looking for respect and protection.  We also have to question the policies Europe is espousing around the world that are driving the people looking for help here.  If France and England had not bombed the hell out of Libya, all these immigrants would not be coming through there.  We know what is happening and that Europe is the cause of the problem too.  It has to deal with those issues in a proper way, ensuring that people can make a life for themselves in their own countries.  That is what will help and will solve the issue once and for all. <\/p>  <p>  Everybody is speaking about Brexit and my voice will not add a wild pile to the discussion.  We are talking in circles because it is not in our control.  The Brits are going to do what they will do and we have to react to that.  Ultimately what the Europeans do is not in our control either.  We are in the lucky position at the minute of thinking we are in great control and they are doing everything for us on Brexit.  They are doing it for us only because it is getting at the Brits.  Once the Brits do the deal with them we will be cut loose.  That is how it will work.  We have to play the game and see what the issues are.  We will have no control over what the Brits do and that is the sad part of it.  They will make the decisions on what they will do and we can only react.  That is all that is left for us to do.  It is useful in filling up a lot of air time here as we talk about it but we are talking in circles and talking to ourselves until we see what is happening. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700029#BB00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1530107100,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to be truthful when she gives her interpretation of what is happening in respect of England leaving the EU.<\/p><p>We were given the impression before Christmas by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste that all was rosy in the garden and that there would not be a hard border.  I do not know how or where that interpretation came from because it seems that everything is still up in the air.  I believe the discussions should be between Ireland and England and between Europe and England to ensure we do not have a hard border.  It will hurt farming, especially in rural areas, and it will hurt small businesses exporting to the UK and to the North of Ireland.  The Government needs to put pressure on Prime Minister May to come clean and to make a decision sooner rather than later.<\/p> <p> All this is not helping our cause.  Britain needs to be cornered - that is the word - and made to come clean as to what it is going to do.  The Taoiseach is now saying that he will fight and more or less put it up to Prime Minister May.  I hope he will.  I believe, however, that the Government should also be trying to encourage the British Government, and indeed the Labour Party, and have talks to see if there is any way another referendum could be devised that would give people in Britain a chance to vote again.  Many of them voted the last time purely against the establishment and are sorry now about the outcome of the referendum.  I met my own cousins and I asked them about this.  They said they had all voted to get out of the EU but if they got one half of a chance, they would not even have to be asked much, they would all vote to stay.<\/p> <p> We hear people like that, that we know, and are perhaps surprised at their vote in the first place to get out.  That is what I am asking because it is hard to see how we will not have a hard border and how that can be devised.  People need to be told how that will be arrived at.  The Government now needs to pull out all of the stops and do its best for this country because we are depending on it and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee.

As I understand it Minister - the Taoiseach is gone - the European Council will be discussing economic and monetary union, EMU, which governs the euro area as well as the Union's budget.  We know that one of the major illegal activities affecting the EU's financial interests is fraud and smuggling in the European customs transit regime.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, however, to bring concerns from Ireland around a different and more tragic form of smuggling - I refer to human trafficking.  In one year alone, European countries reported 15,846 victims of human trafficking.  Of these, 76% were women and young girls.  We know that two out of three, 67%, of the registered victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation, 21% for other types of forced labour and 12% for other reasons such as begging, organ removal or domestic slavery.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of identified victims were from an EU country.  That is appalling, if the Minister of State wants to listen.  We also know that Members of the European Parliament, MEPs, adopted an anti-trafficking directive in 2011.  It covered issues ranging from prevention to victim support and prosecution of offenders.  Then, in 2016, MEPs assessed the current European legislation to combat human trafficking and recommended several measures to improve the situation.  Two resolutions were adopted in May and July of that year.  MEPs called on EU countries to implement better existing laws and to provide better support to victims.  In light of that, I hope the Taoiseach and his Ministers will raise this matter at the Council and seek immediate clarity on attempts to implement anti-human trafficking laws.  I am aware that economic issues will be on the table but I am asking the Government to use this occasion to highlight this terrible aspect of the violent and brutal underground economy, where profit is made on the back of the human suffering of innocent men, women and children.  It is appalling.<\/p>  <p>  I condemn completely how Deputy Boyd Barrett quoted someone calling the elected president, President Trump, a pig.  That is outrageous language and should not be tolerated in any parliament.  Mr. Trump is the duly elected leader and President of the United States.  Many of our people are living there and many American companies are based here.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke of being racist but that type of language is completely racist.  It is disgraceful and there is no place in a parliament for something like that.  I do not agree with the bombing that took place in the Middle East, and with the EU and the Americans, and do not want us to be associated in any way with it.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us a triple Topical Issue debate.  It is the only way that we could get a debate here for the last five years on the persecution of Christians and minority Muslims in the Middle East.  It is still going on.  There have been allusions today about ships and rescues today and I salute our Naval Service for the work it has done there.  This Parliament, however, will not even discuss the persecution.  Those who live in glasshouses cannot throw stones.  We want to be on the attack and yet we do not want to take any responsibility ourselves for what our EU partners are doing in the Middle East.  There is ongoing and horrible persecution and we have taken in very inadequate numbers of migrants who are fleeing that persecution.<\/p><p>We have to settle our own scores but I appeal for the EU, at this summit, besides mentioning Brexit, to deal with the smuggling regimes and the abuse of human beings that is being carried out on those who are travelling to EU countries and who are exploited by the merchants of sex and slavery.

In the face of a range of new priorities, including climate change, migration, and security, and the departure of the UK - an issue which has been raised several times today - it is important that the EU budget remains relevant for us all.  As the Taoiseach has said, we are open to a larger budget where there is demonstrable added value.  <\/p><p>On Thursday, the European Council will consider whether agreement can be found on the MFF as a whole before the European Parliament rises in May 2019.  This is an ambitious timetable, but we are open to engaging with it.  We are prepared to work constructively for agreement and we can agree to do this at an accelerated pace if necessary, and if that is the decision that is taken.<\/p><p>Discussions on innovation and digital issues at the European Council this week will build on the exchanges at the leaders&rsquo; agenda meeting which happened in Sofia last month.  Completing the digital Single Market, DSM, strategy is an absolute priority for Ireland.  We have worked closely with the European Commission, the European Parliament and other member states to deliver outcomes which are pro-trade, pro-enterprise and pro-innovation.  A fully developed DSM that removes unnecessary barriers to doing business digitally and across borders will present significant opportunities for Irish consumers, particularly Irish SMEs.  I believe it will add over &euro;300 million to the EU GDP overall, and so will provide significant advantages across the board.  Up to the end of April, the Commission had put forward 28 legislative proposals. Of the 28 proposals 11 have already been completed and 17 are still being negotiated by the Council and are with the European Parliament and the Council for approval.  We want to see as much progress as possible across all these files.<\/p><p>While the EU is rightly regarded as a global scientific powerhouse, it lags behind its global competitors, such as the USA, Japan and South Korea, when it is required to turn that knowledge into innovation.  That is something we are trying to address and have to address going forward.  The intention for the European Council this week is to give direction to EU efforts to encourage and reward disruptive innovation and to help boost the success of Europe in commercialising its world class research.  This will deliver new jobs and new business opportunities, will enhance economic growth and will help to tackle societal issues across the EU.  Leaders are expected to propose a European innovation council, which is something we supported in its current pilot phase and which we continue to believe is a good idea.  The European Council is also likely to call for swift examination of the latest data package and to invite the Commission to work with member states on a co-ordinated plan on artificial intelligence, AI, building on its recent communication.  A national AI strategy for Ireland is currently in development, in line with that.  However, we welcome the recent communication on AI, which should contribute towards a comprehensive and integrated European policy and help to guide national policies on this important disruptive technology.  Ireland is committed to engaging in the European AI Alliance and we are delighted that Professor Barry O&rsquo;Sullivan from University College Cork, UCC, has been chosen to represent Ireland in the alliance expert group. <\/p><p>The European Council is also expected to discuss EU relations with Russia.  It is no secret that these are under some considerable strain.  We anticipate that leaders will approve the extension of economic sanctions for a further six months to 31 January 2019.  These sanctions have been in place since 2014, in response to the undermining by Russia of the sovereignty of Ukraine, and direct involvement of Moscow in the conflict in eastern Ukraine which has claimed over 10,000 lives to date.  While the duration of the economic restrictions is linked to the full implementation of the Minsk peace agreements, the EU has made it very clear on numerous occasions that they can be adjusted to take account of developments on the ground.  Ireland firmly supports the continued imposition of sanctions, which aim to encourage Russia to support the implementation of the Minsk agreements and to ensure that the separatists respect the ceasefire commitments in place.  The EU has remained united on this point.  <\/p><p>The lack of progress in relation to the conflict in Ukraine, the recent Salisbury nerve agent poisoning, and the use of chemical weapons in Syria, as well as evidence of involvement in widespread misinformation and other hybrid activities, are all matters of grave concern.  A further recent development relates to the downing of flight MH17 in 2014, in which 298 passengers and crew died, including one Irish national.  In May, a joint investigation board found that the missile system involved in the downing belonged to Russia.  UN Security Council Resolution 2166 calls on those responsible to be held accountable.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we support the European Council should it call on Russia to accept its responsibility.  <\/p><p>I should emphasise that, along with our EU partners, we support selective engagement with Russia where it is clearly in our interests.  We favour ongoing engagement with civil society and greater people-to-people contacts.  However, against the backdrop of recent actions, we see no basis for easing the current restrictive measures or offering concessions to Russia.  <\/p><p>As the Taoiseach said in his statement, migration remains a priority issue for the European Union and is likely to be a major focus at the European Council.  It is worthwhile therefore to provide some further detail on the current situation and what we are expecting from the discussions later this week.  The EU has adopted a broad range of measures over the past few years as part of its comprehensive response to mass migration.  These have included greater engagement with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration, including through the migration partnership framework; the emergency trust fund for Africa, to which Ireland has agreed to double its contribution this year, from &euro;3 million to &euro;6 million; agreeing a plan to relocate migrants from Italy and Greece across the Union; launching Operation Sophia to disrupt people smuggling in the Mediterranean; and providing continuous financial assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants.  <\/p><p>Of course, mass migration is a very complex matter.  I do not need to remind anyone in this House of that fact.  It has been somewhat divisive within the Union.  Some member states have already taken in large numbers of migrants, while others continue to resist accepting any.  In these circumstances, consensus has not yet been reached on how best to reform the common European asylum system, and how to respond to situations such as that which arose with the <i>Aquarius<\/i>earlier this month.  Much credit is due to the Bulgarian Presidency for its efforts to agree a compromise between member states that would strike a balance between responsibility and solidarity.  If there is to be a breakthrough on this particular issue this week, there will have to be a compromise.  However, it appears, based on conversations we had at the General Affairs Council yesterday and at separate meetings, that we are unfortunately not yet at that point.  <\/p><p>Ireland is removed from the full effects of mass migration inflows because of our geographic location and because of Protocol 21, which means that we are not automatically party to many of the response measures which fall under Title V of the treaties.  However, we have played an active and constructive role, including by opting into to the 2015 EU measures on relocation and resettlement.  We admitted the full cohort of 1,022 people under the EU relocation programme which ended last September, and we have taken in 820 people under our resettlement commitments, with a further 220 expected to arrive in the coming months.  <\/p><p>As part of the EU and UNHCR pledging exercise for 2018 and 2019, a total of 600 programme refugees will be resettled from Lebanon this year and in 2019.  Deputies are aware that we also volunteered yesterday, after extensive discussions with the Maltese Government, to take in some of the migrants on board the <i>MV Lifeline<\/i>that is currently stranded off the coast of Malta. <\/p><p> We have also contributed to a series of fully crewed naval vessels to assist with humanitarian search-and-rescue efforts in the Mediterranean, working initially with the Italian Navy as part of Operation Pontus, during which 17,500 people were rescued.  More recently, we contributed vessels to European Union Naval Force Mediterranean, EUNAVFOR Med, also known as Operation Sophia, the EU's operation to try to tackle people trafficking in the Mediterranean.<\/p> <p> We have increased our humanitarian assistance to those affected by the crisis in Syria and elsewhere.  Our view has always been that a comprehensive Europe-wide solution is necessary in order to respond effectively to the mass migration flows.  As part of that, we need to strengthen the Union's external borders, work actively with our partners, show solidarity - including in Africa - and find a way to address the question internally.  We also need to work with our European colleagues and fellow member states to try to deal with the root causes.  As many Deputies have pointed out, most people travelling would prefer to stay at home if many of the reasons as a result of which they are travelling were dealt with.  We need to focus on the root causes as well as everything else.<\/p> <p> Part of the solution has to be a willingness of all EU member states to show solidarity and work together.  I assure Members that Ireland will continue to be constructive in this area.  It is a very complex issue and we will continue to plays active a role as we can as this progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700031#DD00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530108900,"counter":367,"content":"<p>My party leader has already comprehensively addressed the key Brexit issues in advance of the upcoming EU Council meeting.  However, as Brexit spokesperson for my party, I will take the opportunity to make a few key points before I address other issues coming before the Council.<\/p><p>The forthcoming EU Council meeting was touted by the Government as a key milestone in the Brexit negotiations.  More particularly, the T&aacute;naiste had set it as a serious deadline to deliver what he deemed to be significant progress on the backstop and the Irish issues, or else.  However, we were never quite sure what action the T&aacute;naiste was going to take.  We now know that no action will be taken and that the UK will succeed in progressing to October's Council meeting having failed to deliver any real, workable solutions to the Irish issues.<\/p><p>It is a fact, not an opinion, that the EU Council agenda has other major issues to deal with and that we are not the only show in town.  It has been known for quite some time that the migration crisis will dominate discussions, despite what citizens may have been led to believe by the Government.  In reply to parliamentary questions earlier, the T&aacute;naiste said that to seek to stall the talks at this juncture would not be helpful.  I agree.  However, the only one suggesting that we might do so was the T&aacute;naiste himself, two months ago.  That was before it became clear to everyone that the June deadline had all but evaporated and that we were not going to see any real progress on the Irish issues.  With just four months remaining for negotiations, I think it is fair to say, in the context of negotiations of this nature, that we are already in the 11th hour.<\/p><p>It is far from ideal that the backstop, which we were told was cast-iron, bulletproof and rock-solid by the Taoiseach last December, remains unresolved and without a legally binding text in place.  Watching the chaos within the Tory Party and the lack of alternatives from the Labour Party, it is difficult to see how Westminster will ever put a proposal on the table that will satisfy hardline Brexiteers and solve the Irish issues.  With this reality in mind, we are past the time when the Government must dispense with its wait-and-see approach and start putting solutions on the table because we simply cannot rely on the UK to do so.<\/p><p>Domestic preparedness remains far below the level that we would expect.  At this late stage, it is truly concerning to see the low level of take-up of the various Brexit grants and supports available to the business community.  This is in the context of a warning from EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week when he addressed a joint sitting of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  He stated, &quot;As the clock ticks down to Brexit, we must prepare for every eventuality, including no deal.  This is neither a desired nor a likely outcome, but it is not an impossible one&quot;.  I assume that this is what finally prompted the Taoiseach over the weekend to accept that a hard Brexit is possible, even if unlikely.  Only now has Government started to prepare for the possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU next March.  Preparations should have begun 18 months ago.  We will now have to pursue these preparations with extra vigour in order to make up for the time lost due to Government inaction.<\/p><p>Despite many Government briefings and shiny policy papers - no one is suggesting that we have not had briefings from the T&aacute;naiste and his Department - key questions remain unanswered.  Every time I ask the tough questions at these briefings and about the papers, they are touted as providing all of the answers but they provide very little information.  I can say without hesitation that when I emerge from said briefings, I am none the wiser as to what will happen to our country in the event of a hard Brexit or the position regarding the backstop, the withdrawal treaty and the transition period if the UK crashes out.  This approach on the part of the Government provides very few real answers or assurances and acts only as a smoke screen, which is fast fading.<\/p><p>In the context of Brexit, it is clear that we have hoped and worked towards achieving considerable progress and a fully binding backstop by the June Council meeting.  We will not have that now.  Heading towards the October meeting, which is, in effect, the absolute deadline, we are supposed to have a withdrawal treaty in place, ready to go to the Council and the European Parliament for ratification by October.  We still have many issues that remain outstanding.  Heading into negotiations between June and October with that deadline looming puts us in a very vulnerable and precarious position as a member state.<\/p><p>Other member states also have concerns .  They are concerned about future trade.  The UK clearly wants to discuss future trade in conjunction with the backstop.  We say we do not want that, but that is what we are heading towards.  It is less than desirable that we have come to a situation where the rhetoric, spin and commentary from the Government from last December to June, up until the weekend just gone, was that we were seeking significant progress.  Now we seem to accept that we will not have that.  We do not know what we are going to get, and we do not have the assurances and certainty that we have rightly requested and demanded.<\/p><p>I now want to discuss the big issue which will dominate this month's Council meeting and which is undoubtedly a major concern for all member states.  I refer to the migration crisis.  The Taoiseach needs to bring this message loud and clear and enact it across Government.  We need a pan-European approach to this issue.  We cannot expect a few member states to shoulder the entire burden.  Greece, Italy and Spain have dealt with a vast influx of people fleeing from their home countries.  It is unfair and wrong that every member state is not doing its fair share.  Doing one's fair share is what it means to be part of a community.  We are not doing enough in Ireland to show solidarity with other member states, particularly those dealing with the largest numbers.  We have taken in fewer than 2,000 migrants and we said yesterday that we would take a whopping 25 more people in.  Really, that is just gesture politics; it does not put a dent in the overall numbers.  We have to do a great deal more to show that we are serious about playing our part in dealing with this crisis.<\/p><p>On a basic level, as fellow human beings we have to show compassion for these poor people, who are fleeing the most horrific and unimaginable situations, with many of their friends and family dying in their attempts to make that perilous journey.  I commend Chancellor Merkel on the leadership she showed two years ago when Germany opened its doors to vulnerable migrants who needed help and when other member states did not do so.  She faced huge difficulties in keeping her country onside and united.  She now faces huge difficulties in keeping her coalition Government together due to the migrant crisis.  Without genuine and sincere backing from other member states and a commitment that we will all do our bit and share the burden, we could end up regressing and seeing the situation worsen for migrants coming into the EU.<\/p><p>What is happening in Libya is nothing short of the torture of migrants.  They are being stripped of their basic human rights, with every last penny extorted from them and their families.  Sums of thousands are often demanded for the promise of making that perilous crossing to Europe.  The United Nations estimates that hundreds of thousands of migrants remain detained in Libya.  Those who make it to Italy tell of being extorted, beaten, tortured, raped, starved and forced to work for no pay.  We have to question the provision of EU supports to Libyan authorities in the context of what we now know is happening.  Our policies should never make a situation worse, and if we have evidence that this is the case, we must adapt.  There is something very wrong in the world when a boat carrying 234 migrants - people - is stranded in international waters with nowhere to dock.  I refer to the <i>MV Lifeline<\/i>.  Is it not easy to make a decision to block these poor people from seeking refuge when those making the decisions do so, no doubt, from a place of comfort, privilege and safety?  We must all check our privileges and count ourselves lucky that, despite the many social challenges we face, for the most part we live in a safe and wealthy country in which people have great opportunities.  When we remember our country's history and that fact that, due to famine, our people had to leave to seek better lives elsewhere, we have to do all we can to help those less fortunate.  The EU and all its member states, Ireland included, must play a strong role in responding to what is a terrible humanitarian crisis.<\/p><p>At this juncture, I want to single out our Defence Forces and our Naval Service for the amazing work they have done in helping to deal with this humanitarian crisis and limit the loss of life in the Mediterranean.  They have worked closely with the Italian Armed Forces and saved so many lives in the process.  The men and women of the Defence Forces once again responded to the call of duty and stepped up to the mark.  We are also incredibly proud of the work they have done.  This was done despite the huge challenges the Defence Forces face, such as those relating to low pay, poor working conditions and major issues in respect of recruitment and retention that have yet to be addressed despite many calls from the Defence Forces community and from Members of this House, including me.<\/p><p>Missions such as that in the Mediterranean remind us that persons serving in our Defence Forces are not public servants in the ordinary meaning.  Their job is specialised, dangerous and seriously demanding.  In addition, it limits their rights as workers.<\/p><p>That should be recognised in the context of pay and conditions.  I urge the Government to consider this in the context of pay talks and the upcoming budget and seriously address the shortcomings and failures and look after those serving in our Defence Forces.  We have no problem requesting that they respond to a humanitarian crisis, and they will always do so.  We have no problem requesting that they respond to severe weather conditions and difficulties in our own country.  There is no doubt we will have no problem in requesting that they scale up and come to the fore, if needed, in the event of a hard Brexit where our international waters and our boundaries will change.  If we expect them to do this, we have to pay them properly but we do not do so.  The Defences Forces are haemorrhaging people.  If asked, they will do what they can but one cannot get blood from a stone.  It is high time the Minister of State realised he is at the helm of what is a sinking organisation.  The Taoiseach mentioned PESCO in his contribution.  We need a properly resourced and fully functioning Defence Force to participate in PESCO.  While many positive programmes are available to us, unless we get our own house in order, we will not be able to avail of them.<\/p> <p> The situation in Hungary, where it is now an offence for citizens to help an asylum seeker or migrant, is outrageous and must be condemned by the Government.  I trust, and I ask, that the Taoiseach and the Minister of State will raise this at the Council meeting with their counterparts and seek an EU response to such an inhumane and cruel law.  It opposes every value on which the EU was founded.  It goes against everything we believe in, in terms of basic human rights and dignity for people, and it cannot be permitted to persist in any member state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700032#EE00200","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530109500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Following the previous statements in advance of a Council meeting, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach promised we would see real and significant progress at this summit in June on Brexit, the Irish issues associated with Brexit and the December and March agreements, which in the past were considered to be cast-iron guarantees.  The benchmark set for achievement and delivery at this summit was not set by those of us in opposition.  We want to make sure we get the best outcome for Ireland, and we would have wanted to see real and substantial progress well in advance of June, but this date for progress was set by the Government, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>  <p>  The entire approach of the Government to the Article 50 negotiations and the ongoing talks between Britain and the EU in respect of the future relationship between Britain and Europe is that we decouple the Irish issues from the wider issue of that relationship and trade issues between those two blocs.  It was important this was done because we are all still trying to avoid ending up in October with a scenario where huge pressure will be put on the Government in respect of some potential deal that may be a bad deal for Ireland or may be just an okay deal, but not the deal we were promised and not the deal we need to avoid any hardening of the Border, to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to protect citizens rights.<\/p>  <p>  The benchmark set by the Government was not just with regard to decoupling the Irish issues from the wider relationship issues between Britain and the European Union; it was also to hold the British Government to account on the high-level principles and commitments it gave to avoid a hard border, and to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all it parts and the rights of EU citizens and Irish citizens who live in the North.  Sadly, since then, we have not had any progress.  We are not just saying this.  Today the Taoiseach said that from the Government's perspective we have not seen any real and substantial progress.  The Union in its statement that will be published tomorrow will clearly state there has been no real and substantial progress.  What incentive is there for British Government to come to the table with serious proposals when every time a deadline is set and every time a deadline is made the British Government is simply allowed to walk away from its responsibilities?  How can we have a cast-iron guarantee in December and then arrive in June with no real or substantial progress on any of the issues that were meant to be an insurance policy for the Irish people, whereby we would effectively have alignment with the rules of the Single Market, the internal market and the customs union on the island of Ireland to ensure no divergence in rules and standards, no hardening of the Border, absolute certainty for businesses either side of the Border and absolute certainty for citizens in terms of their rights?<\/p>  <p>  The British Government has torn up our insurance policy, which is the backstop.  We have no guarantees, apart from the common travel area, on citizens' rights.  We have no guarantees from the British Government on how it will protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  We are wandering into a space where in October all the issues, including the Irish issues, will be in one big melting pot and there will be crisis talks from which something will emerge but not, unfortunately, what we were promised.<\/p>  <p>  While my quarrel is directly with the British Government - and Teachta McDonald made the point that the fact the British Government made promises in December and seems to be resiling from them, or has not followed through should not be lost on people - we also have a responsibility to hold the Government to account.  When the Government stated there had to be progress by June, that means there should have been progress, yet it has not happened.  Everybody in the House has been supportive of the position that we get a good deal for Ireland, and has supported the approach of the EU and the Government to get there, but that strategy up to now has failed.  It has failed the Irish people because we simply do not have the certainties that people need and, unfortunately, this is something to which the Government will have to face up.  This means tough straight talking has to be done at the June summit by the Taoiseach to our European counterparts and the British Government that it is not good enough.  We need to see progress well in advance of October or we will be in serious danger of having a bad Brexit for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700033#FF00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1530109500,"counter":370,"content":"<p>The European Council will have an important discussion on Brexit, and I echo the statements made by Teachta&iacute; McDonald and Cullinane.  However, Brexit will not be the only issue discussed.  Migration and defence matters are also on the agenda and I will focus on the issue of migration.  We have witnessed a worrying increase in racist and fascist sentiments in Europe regarding migrants and refugees.  It was interesting that most Opposition speakers have commented on this in the debate.  The world is facing an unprecedented number of humanitarian crises with wars, hunger and oppression devastating many parts of the globe.  The unequal economic model that many European countries enforce on the global south has created corruption, poverty, inequality and environmental disasters, as have their military interventions and arms sales to despotic dictators.<\/p>  <p>  World refugee day was 20 June, and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the total number of refugees worldwide is now 68.5 million.  No one becomes a refugee by choice but the rest of us have a choice about how we help people who have been forced to do just that.  Europe likes to pride itself on its human rights, but the EU is currently pushing back vulnerable refugees looking for sanctuary.  It is wrong on so many levels and a gross violation of human rights.<\/p>  <p>  The new government in Italy, which includes the far right, is refusing to let ships full of refugees dock and has stated it intends to carry out a census of the Roma population in Italy.  Have we learned nothing from the Holocaust 70 years ago, when Roma, Jews, other minorities and trade unionists were systematically cut off, separated, dehumanised and subject to genocide?<\/p>  <p>  The EU has made a deal with the oppressive regime in Turkey to ensure the authorities keep vulnerable refugees in the country, where many of their human rights will, undoubtedly, be violated.  It is also supporting the Libyan coastguard, which is another theme mentioned by all speakers.  It is basically an armed militia that pushes boats of vulnerable refugees back to Libya, where they will be robbed and detained in overcrowded jails run by armed militia.<\/p><p>They will be beaten, tortured and raped.  These incidents have all been documented.  Many of the people will be disappeared into the system and we do not know where they will go.  Many will probably be killed and others will be sold as slaves at public auctions.  This is what we are pushing people back to and it has all been documented and photographed, so nobody can say they did not know about it.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach yesterday stated he was proud of the Irish Navy, which is working with the Libyan coastguard.  I deeply regret that we are supporting this force, which is complicit in horrific human rights abuses.  European countries, bar a few notable exceptions, need to rethink fundamentally their refugee policies and create a blueprint for responding to refugees' needs that respects human rights, human dignity and the right to claim sanctuary in Europe.  We need to create more safe legal routes for refugees to gain sanctuary in Ireland and Europe.  Trying to block refugees from getting sanctuary in the EU is a violation of international law and Ireland should oppose attempts to imprison refugees in war-torn countries like Libya.<\/p> <p> There will be mention of defence, PESCO and so on.  Our direction is wrong and we are being forced to spend more money on defence.  I have no difficulty spending money on the wages of the Defence Forces but the idea of quadrupling the spend on defence facilities and armies while people are lying on the streets or while we have a broken health service is fundamentally wrong.  It also undermines our neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700033#FF00300","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530110100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The next meeting of the European Council will take place in Brussels tomorrow and Friday, where there will be discussions on migration, including reform of the Common European Asylum System, CEAS, the economy and multi-annual financial framework, PESCO and co-operation with NATO, and, most important for us, Brexit.  On Sunday last, 16 of the 28 EU leaders held a mini-summit hosted by the Commission on the migration crisis.  We have noted the fallout between the Council and the Commission regarding the organisation of that summit.  It is clear that migration will be one of the most contentious issues on which to find consensus during the summit.  A pan-European approach to migration is essential, particularly as we think of people who have died trying to cross into Europe because they wanted to migrate here.<\/p><p>We have just passed the second anniversary of the shock Brexit vote of 23 June 2016 and the clock is ticking on tense negotiations.  I commend Dublin City University, DCU, on establishing the DCU Brexit Institute and producing and publishing its report, Two Years Since the Brexit Referendum.  I received a copy earlier this week and I am sure the Minister has also had an opportunity to have a look at it.  This is the only such institute in Ireland and was the first European one set up to examine Brexit challenges.  The report calls the upcoming Council meeting &quot;crucial&quot;.  The Brexit section of the European Commission&rsquo;s website tells us that Mr. Michel Barnier will present the current status of the negotiations to the European Council and Parliament this week.  With only nine months left until the official exit date of 29 March 2019 and just three months to finalise this agreement, there is significant work to be done by October.  Yesterday, the UK completed its withdrawal Bill, which repeals its European Communities Act 1972.  As I understand it, the UK is also planning a withdrawal and implementation Bill following any agreement with the European Union.<\/p><p>The so-called backstop agreement states that &quot;in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment&quot; with the Single Market to protect and maintain the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  The UK Cabinet rejected the British Prime Minister's suggestions that regulatory alignment would remain between the whole of the UK and the EU pre-2020.  Mr. Alexander Stubb, who was the Finnish Prime Minister from 2014 to 2015, recently reflected on the BBC on how crucial EU decisions are often made at the last possible moment and the Brexit negotiation seems to be typical in this regard.  There is growing unease among our constituents about the lethargic way the Government is handling Ireland's approach to perhaps the most crucial event in our history since the Second World War.  The presence in this Chamber last week of Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, along with Mr. Barnier and Commissioner Phil Hogan in the Gallery, demonstrated once again how dependent the Government is on the goodwill of our 26 EU partners.<\/p><p>The growing chorus of concern from British and EU industrial and trade union leaders about a bad deal Brexit or a no-deal Brexit shows how even more vulnerable the economy will be in such circumstances.  For many constituents, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach seem often to be merely spectators in their engagement with the UK Tory regime and with the EU ministerial colleagues.  In effect, that will probably be evident again this week.  There should be total focus on the crucial issues of preventing a border re-emerging in our country and the massive importance of the UK market for Irish agriculture, services and industry but it still seems to be lacking in the current Government&rsquo;s interactions with the UK and our EU partners and with public opinion throughout the continent.<\/p><p>Despite President Juncker&rsquo;s shout of &quot;Yes&quot; to my colleague in reply to Deputy Boyd Barrett as to whether the EU would refute any establishment of an EU border on this island, people remain concerned that Ireland could end up being shafted at the conclusion of these negotiations, perhaps at some resolution in October or at the last minute in February or March next year, as is often the EU's way.  I note the <i>Irish Times <\/i>journalist, Mr. Stephen Collins, reported yesterday from the Danube delta that our Romanian fellow EU citizens were enthusiastic supporters of Ireland&rsquo;s EU-Brexit stance.  As evidenced by his recent article on the UK dynasty and Queen Victoria, commentators like Mr. Collins seem to live in a parallel universe.  The harsh reality is that the larger EU states, led by Germany and France, will try to reach an accommodation with the UK that somehow keeps the UK in a multispeed EU orbit.  Any fallout from such an agreement that disadvantages the Irish people, North and South, will just be seen as necessary and unfortunate collateral damage.  It is a fear that citizens have.<\/p><p>This is why the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach need to be much more vocal in setting out a future EU and UK relationship that protects Irish interests.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say he cannot advise the British Prime Minister where to go.  We have our interests that must be relentlessly and remorselessly placed in front of the British.  Despite the so-called backstop agreement, this Government has failed to set out the necessary implementation of such a vision on the spurious grounds that Mr. Juncker and Mr. Barnier will somehow protect us.<\/p><p>Last month, during in a previous debate, I spoke about the French President Emmanuel Macron's vision for the future of Europe.  In his programme, outlined in his book, <i>Revolution<\/i>, and his speech in the Sorbonne last September, he spoke about his wish for the sovereignty of the historic French republic of 1789 to be transferred to a new republic of Europe, led by France and Germany.  His vision seems to be taking some strides forward, with both countries coming together to propose a eurozone budget and the reform of the European Monetary Union.  On 19 June, Mr. Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced their collaboration on a eurozone budget.  Yesterday, the French Finance Minister, Mr. Bruno Le Maire, told us this Franco-German proposal is &quot;not negotiable for France.&quot;  Although Ireland has engaged with Macron's vision - at least I have heard the Taoiseach saying he would engage with it - Mr. Le Maire has criticised the 12 countries, of which Ireland is one, which have voiced opposition to such proposals.  He said that we have &quot;expressed an interest in a budget and have reservations regarding fiscal convergence.&quot;  That is, of course, putting it mildly.  The tactics of calling these proposals non-negotiable days before the Council's meeting is extremely unhelpful but something that is becoming evident, unfortunately, in Macron&rsquo;s attitude towards the EU.<\/p><p>The EU budgetary proposals were agreed in a meeting in Meseberg recently and put forward fiscal plans to assist countries entering recession, as well as the use of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, to provide a system of loans for countries.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has repeatedly expressed concerns over the proposed Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, CCCTB, and plans for an EU digital tax.  A recent American study identified Ireland as the largest tax haven in the world and the critique of the Irish corporation tax system have been widely disseminated in the EU.  Professor Seamus Coffey of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has identified our corporation tax regime as relatively stable to 2020 but clearly developments in the wake of Mr. Macron&rsquo;s plans for a federal EU would have a major impact on the State's finances going into the 2020s.  The fact remains that most Irish people do not share Mr. Macron&rsquo;s vision and would prefer the EU to continue as a confederation of nation states.<\/p><p>Following Brexit, our people may be faced with a further profound historic choice of whether to progress down the Macron road or to remain with states like Denmark and Sweden in an outer orbit of a multispeed Europe.<\/p><p>We cannot allow this terrible pressure of the Brexit negotiation.  I appreciate the pressure the Government is under in this regard.  The Government will be judged by this in the forthcoming general election, whenever it happens.  It would be reprehensible to use the pressure of Brexit as a lever to rush us into a federal European state dominated by Germany, France, Spain and Italy, despite the comments of the new Italian Government.<br\/><br\/>During our most recent debate on European affairs, I drew attention to our record as a net contributor for the past five years.  We are one of only nine net contributors among the 28 member states, which is striking.  The EU budget between 2021 and 2027 totals &euro;1.27 trillion or 1.1% of gross national income.  The EU Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, wanted a higher percentage.  Anyway, it means that a major contribution is being made by this country year in, year out towards the maintenance of the EU.  We must ensure this organisation to which we contribute so much is <i>au fait<\/i>with our needs and that emerging from Brexit we will not be placed in a terribly disadvantaged situation.<br\/><br\/>Last year, I was one of 45 Deputies who voted against the Government proposal to join the PESCO.  I remain deeply opposed to any attempt to engage Ireland in an EU army.  We have heard of Macron's military force, the European intervention initiative, which, apparently, will include Britain.<br\/><br\/>I wish to refer briefly to the migration crisis.  The new Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Salvini, recently stoked anti-immigration rhetoric by turning away a migrant ship carrying 629 people.  Malta then refused the ship but made a separate decision to accept the ship.  I appreciate our Government's action in this regard.  Clearly, we need a pan-European approach to migration that is fair to everyone.<br\/><br\/>I appreciate being able to make these comments, in particular on Brexit, which is now at such a crucial point in the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700034#GG00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530110700,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I welcome the news from the T&aacute;naiste today that the Government has given extra funding to the UNRWA for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.  I understand Ireland will give &euro;250,000.  I am raising the issue because UNRWA has stated that it is experiencing its worst funding crisis of the past 70 years.  The agency was set up because of Israel's expulsion of Palestinian people from Palestine.  Many Palestinian refugees are in the occupied West Bank, Gaza, Syria and Jordan.  It is welcome that the Government has tried to address some of the shortfall.  There is a shortfall because Donald Trump's Administration has withdrawn 80% of the funding.  It is small beer compared to the funding the US gives Israel, but it will have profound effects on the many Palestinians in refugee camps.  These people rely on the funding for schools and so on.  The head of the agency says that if the funding is not met by other donors, people will suffer.  It is probably in the interests of the Israeli Government that Palestinians suffer even more.  This is about collective punishment by another means on the part of the American Administration, including Mr. Trump.  He is probably the greatest Zionist of them all.<\/p>  <p>  I am unsure if the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach will attend the European Council but I hope he will raise the issue.  One startling aspect of the crisis in Palestine is the UN reckons that in 2020, one and a half years from now, the Gaza Strip, where 1.2 million people live, will become unliveable.  That will have profound effects for those people.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies and citizens of this country, we have always had a pro-Palestinian view.  We saw Palestinian people being driven out of their homes and discriminated against on a daily basis.  The general tone of this State and of the people who live here is pro-Palestinian.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Government has granted a further &euro;250,000.  That brings our contribution up to &euro;6 million to the fund.  However, the crisis will continue.  We have run out of adjectives to describe what Donald Trump is about.  He is a maniac who will destroy many of the people who he believes are against his policy.  Our solidarity is always with the Palestinian people.  I welcome the new funding.

As the Taoiseach stated, we will seek to continue to play a constructive role in the discussions on this issue and to make a positive contribution.  We volunteered yesterday to take in some of the migrants on board the <i>MV Lifeline<\/i>that is currently stranded off the coast of Malta.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, specifically those in our Naval Service, whose actions have saved more than 17,500 lives in the Mediterranean Sea in recent years.  They continue to perform vital functions as part of Operation Sophia.  I commend them on their professionalism and service to our great country.<\/p><p>The European Council is expected to take decisions on strengthening external border controls and working with countries of origin and transit, with only incremental progress likely at this stage on reform of the common European asylum system.<\/p><p>We anticipate unity on jobs, growth and competitiveness around the Commission's proposed responses to the US steel and aluminium tariffs.  Ireland fully subscribes to the EU position that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules.<\/p><p>Digital taxation may be discussed.  We strongly agree that all companies should pay their taxes.  However, the challenges of taxation in a globalised digital world are such that only the widest international response is likely to be effective.<\/p><p>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Helen McEntee, has outlined our approach to the multi-annual financial framework.  We want continued support for the programmes that work well and deliver European added value, including the CAP and Cohesion Funds.  At the same time, we are open to spending new money on new priorities if there is a clear rationale for doing so at European level.<\/p><p>Discussions at the European Council on the issues within my areas of responsibility, namely, security and defence, will provide a welcome opportunity to review progress across a number of fronts.  As on previous occasions, the NATO Secretary General, Mr. Stoltenberg, will have the opportunity to address the European Council.  He is likely to emphasise the importance of complementarity between the EU and NATO and the need for strong European defence co-operation.<\/p><p>Ireland is one of six member states that are not members of NATO.  This, along with our military neutrality, is a foreign policy strength.  It enhances our position as an honest broker and as UN peacekeepers in Lebanon with UNIFIL and UNDOF as well as all our missions overseas.  This does not mean we do not support appropriate co-operation with NATO.  Such co-operation is set out in the EU global strategy and is welcome.  I anticipate there will be a call for a new joint declaration by the President of the Council, the President of the Commission and the Secretary General of NATO on EU-NATO co-operation to update on progress since the declaration in 2016.<\/p><p>Work has moved forward within the EU with the launch of PESCO.  Ireland is a founder member and is participating in two projects, namely, a centre of excellence for EU military training missions and the upgrade of maritime surveillance systems.<\/p><p>PESCO provides a mechanism through which crisis management capabilities can be developed by member states in support of Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, operations.  Participation in PESCO in no way changes our policy of military neutrality, contrary to what some Members of this House may think.  We will continue to make our distinctive contribution, based on our own traditions and strengths.  Work is also ongoing on a range of other issues including military mobility and funding for capability development, including a proposal to establish the European defence fund, with a view to the next multi-annual financial framework and further development of the civilian CSDP.  We will continue to engage constructively with our EU partners on these proposals.  As Deputies are aware, the EU 27 leaders, meeting in Article 50 format on Friday morning, will discuss Brexit.  As the Taoiseach has said, the lack of progress in the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement is very disappointing for all.  There is now an urgent need to intensify efforts if we are to conclude the agreement and have it operational by the time the UK leaves. <\/p> <p>The European Council is likely to send a clear message to the UK that these negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.  Without a backstop, there will be no withdrawal agreement and therefore no transition arrangements.  While we hope that the future relationship between the EU and the UK will be as close, comprehensive and ambitious as possible, the Government continues to plan for the full range of scenarios.  It is likely that the European Council will urge all member states to do the same. <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach will report back to the D&aacute;il next week on the outcome of the European Council meeting which he will attend tomorrow and on Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700035#HH00300","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530111300,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.02 p.m. and resumed at 5.02 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1530111600,"counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700037#PP00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Supply","time":1530111600,"counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700037#PP00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1530111600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this Topical Issue matter.  Its primary purpose is to give effect to the potential for additional conservation measures such as a so-called hosepipe ban, but also restrictions on the use of commercial car washing facilities, whether formal or informal.  I want to state very clearly that I am not very interested in draconian measures, but we must look at communities such as Skerries in north County Dublin.  Only two weeks ago in this Chamber the Minister of State responded to all Members representing Dublin Fingal across all parties on the chronic shortage of water affecting a part of that particular community.  People there had no water for 48 hours in some instances.  It is appropriate for us to look at the implementation of hosepipe bans, administered either through Irish Water or through the local authority.  I believe the latter would be the more appropriate.  This is a serious issue that will need to be addressed until such time as the capital and, indeed, other parts of the country have a water supply capable of withstanding more than a few days of sunshine.  Today is a beautiful day.  The temperature is in the high twenties in Dublin.  I am sure it is higher elsewhere in the country.  However, so far as I am aware, there are six locations in the State that are without water at the moment, including one location in my constituency and another in County Longford.<\/p>  <p>  I got a text message this morning from a constituent who was advising me that there was a queue for the car wash at a service station in an area of north County Dublin affected by water throttling.  I am sure that there will be people who will, perhaps unknowingly, be watering their gardens, potted plants or whatever it might be.  We have to take responsibility for the chronic underfunding of water infrastructure in this State not just in the last few years or the last decade, but over generations.  We know of the problems.  We have identified them through the work programme Irish Water has worked out and through work which local authorities have done for generations.<\/p>  <p>  It is also appropriate for us to recognise that it will be some time before we have the sort of headroom that other European nations have.  Many of these operate at between 80% and 90% of capacity whereas Dublin operates at 97%.  To put some figures on it, the production capacity for the greater Dublin area is 610 million litres per day.  At the height of last summer our usage was 566 million litres per day.  On Monday our usage was 609 million litres.  The headroom figure for the entire area was 1 million litres.  We have to have a real conversation not just with ourselves, but with our neighbours.  A Newstalk journalist carried out a straw poll online yesterday.  It was not very scientific.  There were three questions.  It asked what one would do if one saw someone wasting water or watering his or her garden during a period of drought when there were water restrictions in place.  More than 60% of respondents said that they would do nothing.  We really need to do something rather than saying nothing and not even approaching the person to ask if he or she is aware that a water restriction is in place.<\/p>  <p>  Until such time as we can resolve our supply and leakage issues, among other things, this particular measure, which is contained in the Water Services Act 2007, should be implemented and its administration should be delegated to local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700037#PP00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1530111600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I thank Deputy Farrell for raising this very timely and important issue.  As we speak, large parts of the country are experiencing temperatures above 30&deg;.  While this issue is affecting several local authority areas at present, it has the potential to expand into other areas.  This debate provides an opportunity to outline and discuss the legislative and administrative arrangements in place to promote water conservation in response to anticipated prolonged periods of excessively hot weather such as that we are currently experiencing.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Farrell on the need to promote water conservation.  The suggestion of a hosepipe ban is one possible measure, but there are many other measures too and I hope that we can all encourage water conservation at this time.  In addressing the specific proposed hosepipe ban measure raised by Deputy Farrell it is important to point out that sections 56(16) to 56(25) of the Water Services Act 2007 already make statutory provision for the introduction of a such a ban and other restrictions designed to conserve water supplies during times of drought.  It also provides for the application of a fixed payment notice or, in plain terms, a fine of &euro;125 for breach of such restrictions to facilitate enforcement.  These arrangements can come into force when a water services authority, which effectively means Irish Water since legal responsibility for the public water system transferred from local authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014, is of the opinion that a serious shortage of water supplies exists or is imminent in an area.  This would typically be during or following a prolonged period of dry weather but, in any event, it is possible for Irish Water to make such an order where demand is expected to exceed supply and it becomes necessary to restrict the use of water supplies including restricting certain activities involving the use of water.<\/p>  <p>  Specified activities which may be restricted include watering a garden, watering of recreational parks or sports grounds, irrigating or spraying crops, washing vehicles, the provision of commercial washing services for a vehicle or trailer, or filling or replenishing a swimming pool or an artificial pond or lake.  In practice the restrictions may apply to specified activities for all or specified parts of the day.  Before making an order the water services authority must give public notice of its intention to make such order and the period for which the order will remain in force through advertising in the public press or broadcast announcements on television or local or national radio.  Such provisions are well established in other European and international jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  While the option of a hosepipe ban is there, we need to look to other conservation measures and the management of our water supplies.  Irish Water&rsquo;s drought management group has been meeting to assess the risk to drinking water supplies in areas that include the midlands, particularly Athlone and Mullingar; parts of Offaly; Longford; Kilkenny; parts of Donegal; and the greater Dublin area, where the demand for treated water almost meets available supply.  The Dublin region is currently using approximately 600 million litres of water a day, which is close to the maximum amount of water that can be treated on a daily basis.  Irish Water believes that current storage in the raw water reservoirs in the greater Dublin area, at Roundwood and Pollaphuca are reasonable and they do not see water shortages at present.  However, if the summer and autumn continue dry and hot, these reservoirs will come under pressure later in the year.<\/p>  <p>  The main pressures arise from the capacity to produce treated water and Irish Water has seen significant increases of the order of 20 million to 30 million litres per day, which occasionally exceeds production capacity.  This is not sustainable for more than a few weeks without the need for some management action to conserve water.  Irish Water is considering all measures that might be used to encourage people to conserve water.  In the meantime it is asking the public to be mindful of their water usage and to take every measure possible to conserve water.  Water usage in the home, garden or business has a direct impact not only on the water user, but on their neighbours, their families and the wider community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700037#PP00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1530112200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Water supply, particularly in some areas of the State, is on a knife edge.  The prevalence of good weather and the lack of rain will only add to that.  I fully understand the Minister of State's remark that Irish Water believes the two main facilities for the storage of water for the Dublin area, including Poulaphouca, contain reasonable levels of water.  I do not want to become parochial but I obviously know a lot about the Skerries area.  The issue is that if the Skerries problem is to recur in the near future because of these issues or if the Skerries reservoir drops below a reasonable level without the pump that we discussed in the House the week before last, we will have restrictions within the county of Dublin.  There will be throttling and a potential loss of supply in certain areas on the periphery of the network.  As such, even though not all parts of the city or country are affected, there will be water restrictions.  Thus, the conservation of water, up to and including the banning of commercial car washes from operating and, potentially, community bans on hoses, should take place.  If ever there were reason for Irish Water to utilise section 56 of the Water Services Act, this would be it.  As citizens, we should get used to this until such time as our supply issues are resolved.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the Minister of State's lengthy reply in which he outlined in detail the measures being taken by Irish Water.

The national development plan puts aside &euro;8.5 billion to improve the public drinking water and wastewater systems over the next ten years.  We have had gross underinvestment for an awfully long time.  There is so little headroom considering the volumes of water produced and consumed daily.

The Deputy spoke about the possibility of a long, dry summer.  The prevalence of extreme weather conditions presents unique problems for the country's water infrastructure.  It behoves all authorities of the State, in addition to citizens, to recognise that their use of water will have a direct impact on their neighbours and communities if they do not act responsibly.

I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing it.  Will the Minister for Health intervene to sanction a pilot scheme for a new system of drug reimbursement for Ocrevus, which is for primary progressive multiple sclerosis, PPMS.  Ocrevus is the first medicine approved to treat PPMS.  The drug has been approved to reduce the progression of physical multiple sclerosis or physical disability for PPMS patients.  The manufacturer, Roche, has outlined a system of reimbursement whereby the HSE would match the price currently paid in Germany with a view to reducing the price once all 14 western European countries have negotiated a wholesale factory price.  Once this is done, the average price across the 14 countries would be taken as the standard, and the company would then reimburse any overpayment made in the intervening period.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, asked in this House in September 2017 whether, if we believed the current system was broken, we could start hearing what people wanted to replace it with.  He said he believed it is broken also and said the conundrum is how to come up with a better model.  What I am offering to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Minister is a better model, something that we need to consider.  Given the Minister's acceptance that the current model is broken, we need to come up with innovative ways of reimbursing orphan drugs.<\/p>  <p>  In trials, people treated with Ocrevus had a 46% reduction in the risk of progressing to a wheelchair by comparison with a placebo group.  For a person living with PPMS and for whom disability accumulates twice as fast as with relapsing MS, seven more years without the need for a wheelchair could extend the time he or she could live independently, live in the home or continue working and looking after his or her family.  Therefore, it has very real benefits.  We are talking about a population of MS sufferers in Ireland of approximately 9,000.  Some 10% of this figure is 900.  That is the patient population.<\/p>  <p>  We have an opportunity to examine the 2013 Act to do something that is novel.  Last week, the Minister was very enthused about signing an agreement with the Benelux countries.  The product is available in Holland.  I would quite happily accept the price currently being paid in Holland and going back to the original proposal to average out the price once the 14 western countries have approved of it.  Either way, it is a novel proposal.  The drug has been proven to be effective.  For the 900 people with a very debilitating condition who are looking for hope, I really hope the Government will consider the proposal seriously.  I hope the Minister of State will not give me the standard Department reply.

Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Minister for Health and the HSE.  These new products are often very expensive, however, with a significant potential impact on the health service budget.  The Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of reimbursement decisions.  They include the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.<\/p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, pursuant to the community drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.  The HSE&rsquo;s decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds from the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist reimbursement decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to assess systematically whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p> <p> I have been informed that ocrelizumab, used for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, is currently undergoing a full pharmacoeconomic assessment by the NCPE.  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant moneys involved, it must ensure the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multimillion euro investments on an ongoing basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p> <p> The Minister is keen to engage with the industry to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced.  However, any innovative approaches which may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions in place and must also recognise the context of finite Exchequer resources.  The HSE is the decision-making body on the reimbursement of medicines under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  It is the HSE alone which will make the final decision whether ocrelizumab will be reimbursed taking into consideration the statutory criteria as specified under the 2013 Act.

The proposal the company has made is fair and allows for reimbursement.<\/p>  <p>  I do not like making proposals because I am aware of value for money and finite budgets.  In the past, I have raised the argument for using biosimilar medical products.  In my opinion, there is a low-water figure of &euro;50 million to be saved if we used available biosimilar products which are just as effective as the original brand.  For some reason, we are stalling.  The money is there but it is in another pot.  What could we do with a saving of &euro;50 million?  The costs of Ocrevus, Respreeza and Kuvan - the phenylketonuria, PKU, sufferers will be here tomorrow looking for its approval &ndash; could be met with this saving.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State impress on the Minister, Deputy Harris, this particular point?  It makes sound economic sense like the case for generic medicines.  The industry argued that if we started using generic brands, the sky would fall in.  We did and the sky did not fall in.  The same will apply to biosimilar medical products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700039#RR00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1530112800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I bow to the Deputy&rsquo;s better and professional knowledge of this subject.

These postgraduate students are eligible to grant aid under SUSI&rsquo;s criteria.  However, it is cut off due to time limits.  Some have indicated SUSI is an indiscriminate guillotine for Irish research.  The Department of Education and Skills is responsible for this unfortunate outcome.  It is impossible for some students to complete a postdoctoral degree because of course programming.  A four-year undergraduate degree is a requirement for many students.  This can be followed by a two-year masters.  This leaves a two-year funding window to achieve a PhD which is next to impossible.  There are students not affected by this if their degree path is three years followed by a year long masters.  SUSI will allow them to complete their PhD.<\/p>  <p>  The facts are that SUSI funds some PhD students and cuts off others during their research.  This is a significant anomaly affecting many of our ambitious students who are eager to complete their doctorate studies and contribute in various proactive research ways to the economy.  Cutting off the grant aid is crucial.  It is solely to do with the way courses have been designed.  This is not the fault of any student.  The blame lies with the Department of Education and Skills which has supported these decisions.  It is unfair, unjust and wrong.  Those in most need of financial support are victimised because of programming decisions made by third level institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The Department reinforces this trajectory of senselessness, incomprehension and bias.  There is no lateral thinking, communication or connectivity between SUSI, third level institutions and the Department to resolve this.  Many researchers across various disciplines are affected by this but it is particularly prejudicial to fine arts students whose third level programmes are mainly four years followed by a two-year masters format.  These students are not as exposed to employment-based funding as others and have very little funding available to them.  Accordingly, many are solely dependent on SUSI.  A substantial number of artists have an annual income well below the SUSI threshold, yet these policies ensure they are not supported because of lack of consideration in policy-making.  Students should not be discriminated against because of course duration which has nothing to do with them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has the audacity to call this country the republic of opportunity.  It should tell that to researchers who are having their research stopped by SUSI.  There are many areas of inquiry being undertaken which focus on rural life, the environment, inclusion, diversity and the arts.  Unfortunately, the Department does not have any vision.  It cannot appreciate that our communities need these fact-finding investigations.  It cannot see this research as an investment in our universities.  This research has the very best of Ireland&rsquo;s academics working alongside these PhD students in supervisory roles.  There are two supervisors assigned to every investigation.  The findings are then analytically scrutinised by an external examiner.  These dissertations are comprehensively leading analysis and all for the price of a SUSI grant.<\/p>  <p>  The Department, however, terminates prematurely the funding.  One such researcher told me the Department&rsquo;s lack of awareness and respect is really distressing.  Researchers have appealed decisions that have cancelled their funding.  SUSI is, however, completely indifferent to their situation or the importance of the research because it always upholds its decision to terminate and claims it is following policy.  This is cruel and insane.  It has the potential to be the ultimate win-win situation for the Department, our universities and our communities.  Instead, it oversees a waste of public money, a waste of time for the universities and researchers and wasted opportunities of exploration of which we are in desperate need.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister of State can address this situation.

It is anticipated that the student grant scheme will benefit circa 80,000 students in 2017-18.  The principal support provided by the Department in financial terms is the student grant scheme, or SUSI grant, which makes available means-tested financial assistance to students in further and higher education.

A further &euro;3 million was secured in budget 2018.  Postgraduate students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the student grant scheme for the 2018-19 academic year are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915.

They could have spent four years on their basic degree and two years on their master's - six years in total - and then they are only allowed two more years.  That could be cut off at eight years, and they may well take the extra year or year and a half to complete their studies.  I know two students who do not have a penny.  It is no use talking about tax relief when they do not have any money.  These are excellent students.  This is a discrimination that the Minister of State needs to rectify in the next budget.  Researchers should not be penalised because of course programming.  The ruthless decision by SUSI to conclude research while it is still in progress must stop, but SUSI is only implementing policies laid down by the Government.  SUSI is just an administrative body; the Department of Education and Skills has control of the purse strings and the policy decision.  PhD students do not down tools in June and start back in September; they work right throughout the year.  PhD funding should be paid across 12 months.

Researchers and their supervisors should be supported, not vetoed, cut off midstream and told, \"Tally-ho.

It concerns a situation in a school, the new general data protection regulation, GDPR, and application form 3 for assistive technology.  Because of the new rules introduced by the GDPR, the form has been taken off the website of the Department of Education and Skills.  The form needs to be signed by a principal to be valid.  Obviously, as we are coming into the school summer holidays on Friday, principals will not be available to sign the forms.  There is the added difficulty that one needs an occupational therapist's report stating that the child needs the assistive technology to get access to this.  However, the report will not be accepted without the form and now the application form seems to be unavailable.  Perhaps this is an oversight in a technical area.  I ask the Minister of State and the Department to accept the older form, perhaps until December, in order that parents are not in this situation.  Some schools are saying to parents that they will have to purchase books for the first few weeks until the forms are processed.  As this can take six to eight weeks, they are telling parents they must purchase books to be used in September and October.  At that stage, they hope to have the forms processed and then the child will revert to using assistive technology.  However, this seems absolutely ridiculous because they are putting a cost on parents for books the children will only need for a certain number of weeks.  Clearly, this is just an issue with the GDPR.  Surely some compromise could be found - for example, accepting the older form while everything else is updated.

The type of equipment provided under the assistive technology scheme is varied and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, Braille equipment for children with visual impairment and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of special education needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing applications from schools for assistive technology support.<\/p><p>Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions.<\/p> <p> Professional reports from psychologists or occupational therapists, for example, must be submitted by the school along with the application.  These reports must have a recent and comprehensive professional assessment of the nature and extent of disability, and outline that the equipment is essential for the pupil to access the curriculum.<\/p> <p> SENOs will review the application and professional reports, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met.

We can only understand the need for strengthening our bail laws by looking at recorded crime statistics.  It is appropriate that this debate commences on the day when the Central Statistics Office published its statistics for recorded crime in the first quarter of 2018.  The recorded crime statistics published by the CSO today indicate an increase of 15.9% in the number of fraud, deception and related offences in the year to the end of quarter 1 in 2018, compared with the same period to the end of quarter 1 in 2017.  Similarly in respect of robbery and extortion, there was an increase of 15.9%.  <\/p>  <p>  The recorded crime incidents, classified by offence group and annualised to the end of quarter 1 of 2017 and 2018, show an increase of 388 incidents in the area of sexual offences or 14.7%, which is particularly worrying.  The detailed statistics in quarter 1 of 2018 in respect of sexual offences show 181 rape offences for the first quarter of this year.  The CSO statistics for the fourth quarter of 2017 showed a significant increase between quarter 4 of 2016 and quarter 4 of 2017.  The last time the statistics were published they showed a 28% increase in the number of rapes recorded at that particular time.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to those statistics because it is important to recognise that the debate on bail does not take place in any abstract context.  We know the rate of crime carried out by individuals on bail has been growing steadily in recent years.  It rose from 9% of all crimes in 2011 to 13% of crimes in 2016.<\/p><p>In the latter year, almost 26,000 crimes, including 6,214 thefts and 1,377 burglaries, were committed by individuals who had been released from custody while awaiting trial for separate offences.  In 2016, individuals on bail were also charged with 24 rapes and sexual assaults.  These are significant statistics and they show that serious crime is rising in certain areas.  I refer, in particular, to sexual offences, burglaries and aggravated burglaries.  As a result of a statistical analysis, we are also aware that many of those crimes were committed by individuals who were out on bail.  The purpose of the legislation is to try to strengthen our laws in respect of bail so that it will be more difficult for individuals who have already been convicted of serious criminal offences to be granted bail for subsequent criminal offences for which they are charged.  The Bill seeks to change, from a discretionary requirement to a mandatory requirement, the obligation on a court to refuse bail where it is satisfied that such a refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of serious offences by the person involved.  That is an appropriate response.<\/p> <p> When one looks at the next section, one will see that the court still has limited discretion in this area.  If one is convicted of a serious criminal offence and subsequently charged in respect of another serious criminal offence, the presumption should be that one will not be granted bail.  Alternatively, we should seek to avail of the provisions that were introduced into the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  Sometimes it is forgotten that the Oireachtas, by means of section 11 of that Act, introduced electronic monitoring of certain persons granted bail.  The section has not been commenced yet.  I do not know the reason for that.  We need to do something to change this to strengthen the laws to provide greater protection to people who are victims of crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700041#TT00500","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530114600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, on bringing forward this much needed legislation.  It is a source of great frustration to the public and to the victims of crime.  There is pure astonishment at the number of perpetrators who are already bail for other offences and who have a string of previous convictions.  Sometimes, to the knowledge of the Garda and the courts, they are awaiting charging or sentencing on many other offences yet they remain at large to continue to burgle, steal, pilfer and terrorise.  Not only is it a source of great frustration and alarm to the public but also to those charged with the security of the State, maintaining public order and defending the public from such crimes, namely the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Assistant Commissioner John O'Driscoll recently outlined the difficulties when the garda&iacute; were implementing Operation Thor.  I commend the force on the latter operation, which involved some great successes.  Some of those targeted had a string of offences to their names and many were on bail.  Many were repeat offenders and some were quite prolific.  Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll observed at a press conference that the sentences being imposed for such crimes, particularly burglaries, are inadequate deterrents to repeat offending and are being shrugged off in many cases.  Many of those involved are committing more burglaries before being sentenced for their original crimes.  This highlights the serious concern this is causing for the upper echelons of the Garda as well as for the public.<\/p><p>At a technical level, the Bill seeks to replace the word &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall&quot; in terms of the sentencing guidelines in section 2(a) of the Act.  Judicial discretion does not always work.  We know that sometimes if a court may do something it often does not do it.  We need look no further than section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act for a comparison.  The latter was an attempt to introduce mandatory minimum sentencing for serious offences relating to drugs and the intent to supply.  There was provision made for a ten-year minimum sentence for repeat offenders in that regard.  It includes a get-out-of-jail clause which states that, in exceptional circumstances, a person could avoid minimum sentencing.  Unfortunately, it has been the experience of the courts that almost every offender has been construed as having exceptional circumstances.  Those exceptional circumstances have become the norm.<\/p><p>I cite this as an example of where legislation with good intent behind it has been circumvented and where there have been inconsistencies in the judicial approach.  Having said that, I commend the recent decision of the Court of Appeal.  The court considered a number of burglaries and the difficulties in the consistency of sentencing and tried to impose a reference sentence in a recent judgment, which was reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and elsewhere.  Tom O'Malley, the legal academic, talked about the matter at length.  He commended the judges involved on stating that somebody needs to take the bull by the horns and apply some kind of reference sentencing in order to encourage the courts to be tougher in these kinds of situations and have a criterion and yardstick at hand they can use to apply sentencing.<\/p><p>In a more general sense, there has been a total breakdown of law and order in many rural areas.  As both a State and a society, we are still reeling from the widespread closure of Garda stations in 2012 and 2013.  In my constituency of Kildare North, five stations were closed along the west Wicklow-north Kildare border, including at Ballymore Eustace, Kill, Hollywood and Dunlavin, leaving that swathe of territory completely exposed to criminality.  Those areas continue to be targeted.  The stations covered a very large area.  Not only was there a Garda presence there but there was a local garda in each station who knew the area, had local intelligence, knew the people, the activity and the rhythms of the area and could keep an eye when things went awry.<\/p><p>I attended a meeting in Broadford, north-west Kildare, at the other end of the constituency, last week and we heard tales of machinery being pilfered and agricultural equipment and farm machinery being taken at will.  Often the local garda&iacute; and community are well aware who the perpetrators are.  One individual had over 100 previous offences.  That continues to occur.  That particular area is served by Leixlip Garda station which is an hour's drive away.  Garda&iacute; in Enfield and Edenderry are only moments away but cannot respond because of the jurisdictional splits.  This is a situation I hope the Minister and Garda management can investigate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700042#UU00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1530114600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy O'Callaghan on introducing the legislation.

Crime has destroyed communities and families.  We reflect on the speed with which legislation changes but the legislation before us will be important as we go forward.  The reality is that a huge number of crimes are being perpetrated by people who are out on bail.  We need to enact this legislation fairly rapidly.  It is needed in order to ensure that people in their own homes and businesses are free from fear of a raft of crimes right across the spectrum.  We associate burglaries with late evening and the end of the year but there have been a number of them in the past week.  Burglaries were attempted between Botharbue and Newmarket on a fine summer's day.  All of that leads to a huge fear among families and elderly people who are living on their own.  When they read about individuals who are out on bail committing crimes and see that 1,200 serial offenders have committed burglaries while out on bail, it feeds into the impression that there is nobody in charge and that the Garda does not have the powers or legislative resources to deal with these issues.  This is where we have to come from.  We have to ensure that, in so far as possible, every deterrent is put in place to ensure crime is not profitable.<\/p><p>That is what Deputy O'Callaghan is doing in this Bill.  Garda&iacute; are working flat out.  In some instances it must be very frustrating for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to know who is committing these crimes.  Burglaries alone instil great fear in all communities, rural and urban.  The latest development is bicycles stolen from garden sheds all over Dublin.  Many communities in rural Ireland have set up their own community alert or community watch.  They have all put up cameras.  The old open door policy in rural Ireland had to cease because of the fear communities live in. <\/p> <p> The opening hours of the Garda station in Kanturk have been curtailed and services moved to the central barracks in Mallow.  There has always been a 24-hour Garda presence in the capital of the Duhallow region, which is Kanturk.  That needs to be considered because there are sprawling rural communities in the area.  The farming community has been prone to many robberies of equipment and so forth.  We have to have a serious conversation about where this equipment ends up when it is sold.

Regardless of the CSO figures released today suggesting that homicide figures were down from 87 to 72 to the end of March, most crime figures are on the rise.<\/p>  <p>  Last evening, I attended a local policing forum meeting in my county where it was outlined that most categories of crime are up this year when compared to the same period of 2017.  Serious crimes, including theft and threats to kill, are up on last year's figures.  Last week during Questions on Promised Legislation, I referred to the programme for Government in the context of the brutal murder of Cameron Reilly which has left the community of Dunleer and my constituency in shock, as did the murder earlier this year of Yosuke Sasaki in Dundalk.  These, coupled with the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and Garda Tony Golden, are examples of the need for action on the perpetrators of crime particularly their use of lethal weapons such as guns knives and not to mention brute force which are all part of every day crime perpetrated on our citizens.  Our bail laws are ineffective when perpetrators of violent crime repeatedly appear before the courts and are allowed out on bail to reoffend.  There are no deterrents to discourage such criminal activity.  We need a system where the punishment matches the crime.  We need to get tough on those appearing in court on additional charges, repeat offenders, so that bail will not be considered for such individuals and a deterrent is clearly there to halt these activities.<\/p>  <p>  In the period between the two shocking murders I mentioned, two individuals previously charged with murder in the Dundalk area were out walking the streets on bail, one accused of the murder of a taxi driver, Martin Mulligan, the other accused of the murder of Irene White.  It is my strong belief and that of his family that in the case of Shane O'Farrell had the bail laws not been as relaxed as they are he would be alive today. <\/p>  <p>  For less serious offences such as burglaries and theft, it is common knowledge - and I have been told on more than one occasion by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - in my area that the incidence of many crimes would reduce by up to 60% once certain known criminals who specialise in one or more of these criminal activities were under lock and key.  Surely the fact that they would not qualify for bail, being repeat offenders would go some way to reducing the crime figures.<\/p>  <p>  In the past ten years more than 250,000 crimes were committed by those out on bail.  Currently, the perpetrators of serious crime are apprehended by the Garda, charged and then released while a file is being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  A file could be with the DPP for months.  In the meantime, the people in question are reoffending.  There has to be a system where those charged with violent crimes are held on remand while the DPP considers the files.  If this means provision of more prison spaces, then bring it on.  Before entering this Dail many of us heard talk of zero tolerance, crackdown and a war on crime.  We owe it to our constituents and our communities to take this issue seriously and deal with it.  It is incumbent on us to get back to a position where some degree of law and order is restored and garda&iacute; feel more confident in dealing with these issues and do not think they are wasting their time trying to bring these cases to court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700043#VV00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1530115200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for his work on this Bill.  I agree with much of what he said.  The number of offences committed by persons on bail is deeply disturbing.  A crime committed by someone on bail is particularly troubling as there is an inevitable sense that it could have been prevented.  I assure the Deputy and the House that the Government is committed to tackling this issue.<\/p>  <p>  When we talk about bail we must remember that an accused person enjoys a presumption of innocence in relation to the charge on which he or she is applying for bail.  This has been frequently emphasised by the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights.  The fact that an accused has previous convictions may be a factor which the court can take into account but the accused cannot be doubly punished for those convictions. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the constitutional limits to refusal of bail and I have no doubt that he will have crafted his proposals with this in mind.  I am advised, however, that the proposals in this Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.<\/p>  <p>  The decision on whether to grant bail is a judicial issue rather than an executive power.  In introducing the Bill last December, Deputy O'Callaghan rightly asserted that his proposals do not remove consideration of the issue of bail from the court.  However, the provisions in section 2(a) oblige the court to refuse bail if it \"is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person\".  This precludes the court from considering other factors which have traditionally been deemed to be relevant in bail applications such as the time to trial or the personal circumstances of the accused, including serious illness or disability.<\/p>  <p>  It will be no surprise to the Deputy to note that the Supreme Court has previously stated that precluding the court from considering such factors would not be consistent with the right to personal liberty acknowledged in Article 40 of the Constitution or with Articles 5 and 6(1) of the ECHR.  Section 2(b) contains a similar provision targeted specifically at persons accused of burglary of a dwelling.  As section 2(a) covers all offences, including burglary, I am not sure that this subsection provides anything additional.  In any event, the same constitutional issues arise in respect of this subsection as arise in respect of subsection 2(a).<\/p><p>In short, I do not believe this is constitutionally sound.<\/p> <p> Section 2(c) of the Bill lowers the threshold for what may be considered evidence that the person is likely to commit another burglary of a dwelling.  The threshold is reduced from three prior convictions or pending charges, to just one prior conviction for a burglary of a dwelling.  There is a strong likelihood that this lower threshold would not meet the constitutional or ECHR requirement for proportionality.  ECHR case law is clear that the risk of re-offending can only justify pre-trial detention if there is actual evidence of definite risk of re-offending available and the mere fact of having committed an offence is not sufficient reason for ordering pre-trial detention.  It is difficult to see, therefore, how a provision requiring the court to accept a single prior offence as evidence of future offending could be acceptable in light of ECHR case law.<\/p> <p> Section 3 of the Bill would require a court to impose electronic monitoring on any accused person admitted to bail in respect of a charge of burglary of a dwelling who also has one prior conviction for a burglary of a dwelling.  I also have concerns as to the constitutionality of this provision.  In balancing the accused&rsquo;s right to liberty with the rights of the public, the court is obliged to impose conditions that impinge on the accused person&rsquo;s rights as little as possible in order to achieve the desired aim.  If the imposition of electronic monitoring is mandatory, then the court would be precluded from considering alternatives that may achieve the desired outcome in a less restrictive manner.  It is likely that this provision would breach the test of proportionality in individual cases.<\/p> <p> I have other concerns in respect of the electronic monitoring proposals.  The Government&rsquo;s view is that electronic monitoring has a valuable role to play in monitoring bail conditions but it must be targeted at those cases where it is most likely to be effective.  The mandatory use of electronic monitoring, as proposed by section 3 of this Bill, would reverse the approach taken in the Criminal Justice Act last year.  It is also in breach of Council of Europe guidelines on the use of electronic monitoring.  The provision also contains a number of technical flaws.  It fails to provide for any of the safeguards and consequential provisions necessary to operate an electronic monitoring scheme.  No provision is made for an authorised person to monitor the person&rsquo;s movements, no provision is made for an application to vary or revoke an order, there is no requirement for the person&rsquo;s consent and no restriction on applying the provision to children.<\/p> <p> I do not intend to minimise the issue of offences committed on bail but I do need to state clearly that we already have a robust system of bail laws.  Last year, the Government further strengthened that system with the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2017.  That is important legislation which strengthens the powers of the courts and the Garda in dealing with persistent serious offenders and persons on bail who pose an ongoing threat to the public.  The Act places a greater emphasis on the rights and the safety of victims and of the public in bail decisions while continuing to safeguard the rights of the accused.  It provides increased guidance for the courts and greater transparency in the bail process.<\/p> <p> The Act also provides that electronic monitoring may be imposed as a bail condition if the prosecution applies to the court for such a condition.  Extensive preparations are underway to ensure these provisions can be implemented and, more importantly, to ensure they can be effective.  The report of an inter-agency working group, established to examine these issues, has been submitted to the management board of my Department and is under consideration.  The Criminal Justice Act 2017 was enacted just one year ago and is in force for only ten months.  The impact of the new provisions is not yet reflected in annual crime statistics.  It is too early, therefore, to assess whether or not these changes are having the desired effect.  I am open to revisiting the bail laws if the changes introduced last year are shown to be insufficient but I do not wish to engage in change for the sake of the change.  It is important to await the evidence and take the time to evaluate the effect of the Criminal Justice Act 2017 before we introduce further changes in the law.<\/p> <p> I will not give the impression that we should do nothing to address the issue of offending on bail while we evaluate the recent legislative changes.  On the contrary, there are many other ways in which the Government is targeting offending behaviour, which in turn impact on offences committed on bail.  I want to highlight the area of burglaries, as this type of offending has a high recidivism rate and is a key concern for members of the public.  Operation Thor is a concrete example of how the Government&rsquo;s investment in Garda resources, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in Budget 2018, has impacted on crime.  There were 43% fewer burglaries of homes reported in March 2018 compared to October 2017, following the implementation of the winter phase of Operation Thor.  That involved the undertaking of targeted enforcement and preventative activity and was designed to prevent potential burglars from exploiting the reduced hours of daylight.  A significant drop in burglary offences committed by persons on bail has also been reported since the launch of Operation Thor.<\/p> <p> In addition, the Court of Appeal has recently published sentencing guidelines for burglary at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who appealed several sentences arguing the matter of undue leniency.  The lower courts now have a clear set of principles to follow when sentencing for burglary offences.  While I acknowledge the independence of the courts, I believe this is an important development and will, over time, impact on the number of such offences committed by persons on bail.  The Government&rsquo;s difficulties with this Bill relate primarily to its constitutionality.  I believe the main provisions of the Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution, but not only that, they are also inconsistent with the ECHR.  As the constitutional difficulties relate to the essential aim of the provisions &ndash; obliging the court to refuse bail under certain conditions &ndash; it would not appear that any amendment, whether from me or any other Member of the House, could make the provisions of this Bill constitutional without undermining that aim.<\/p> <p> The constitutional risks are particularly problematic because the Bill replaces the existing section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 with the new provision.  Consequently, if the provisions were enacted and subsequently struck down by the courts as unconstitutional, the courts would have no power to refuse bail to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  This would pose a significant risk to our State&rsquo;s bail laws.  I do not doubt the sincerity of Deputy O'Callaghan.  I listened closely to the remarks of his colleagues on the Opposition benches.  I am also concerned that our laws are robust and the we take every opportunity to assist the Garda in the fight against crime.<\/p> <p> From my point of view, that is twofold.  In respect of resources, this year we have already allocated an unprecedented sum in excess of &euro;1.6 billion under the Garda Vote.  Equally important is my role as a legislator assisting the State by ensuring we have robust legislation available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and everyone involved within the criminal justice system.  Like all Deputies here, I am bound by the Constitution and the constitutional position regarding our bail laws.  I am unable, therefore, to accept this Bill because I have serious doubts as to its constitutionality.  I see Deputy O'Callaghan, a practitioner of some experience and expertise in this regard, amused at my disposition on this legislation.  I invite him to take some time to examine the case law on this issue and, ultimately, to agree with me that his Bill, however well intentioned, is constitutionally and legally unsound.  For those reasons I am unable to accept this Bill and I will be opposing it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700043#VV00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530115800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Ask the people what they want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700044#WW00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1530115800,"counter":412,"content":"<p>It is right and proper, like other Deputies have said, that we reflect on the context.  The crime statistics released this afternoon do not make for positive or encouraging reading.  There are significant increases across a number of heads.  The first three months of the year saw close to 19,000 burglaries and 70,000 thefts.  Those are staggering figures.  There was a 15.9% increase in fraud, deception and hijacking and a 14.7% increase in sexual offences - and over 3,000 of those were in the first three months of the year.  I acknowledge that murders is one of the heads that has fallen.  I recognise, particularly in respect of ongoing feuds and an extremely challenging environment, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working hard to tackle that.  While the environment remains difficult, some headway, I hope, is beginning to be made.  Nonetheless, that figure remains far too high in a general sense.<\/p>  <p>  I believe this is a resources issue.  Despite what the Minister has said, many Garda stations and districts are still running to stand still.  Many Garda stations are only just at or below 2010 levels.  That is certainly the case in the Cork City division, where some of those, such as Mayfield, are well below the 2010 levels.  The figures tell us that Dublin has lost almost 100 garda&iacute; since last year despite what the Minister said about increased numbers and resources.  In real terms, Dublin has lost about 900 core unit garda&iacute; since 2010.  Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy said that rock bottom had been hit in respect of policing numbers in Dublin.<\/p><p> The solution to this is to be found within policing.  While the Minister is keen to flag the number of probationers etc., I am of the view that is where the focus must be.  In rural areas, a farcical situation has arisen whereby almost 50% of front-line garda&iacute; do not have adequate training and clearance to pursue cars at high speed.  Those figures were provided by the Garda Representative Association, GRA; I do not believe the Minister has released the statistics.  Clearly, the ability of garda&iacute; to pursue criminals is severely constrained by that.  The Minister is shaking his head.  He is more than welcome to publish the figures, but until he does so I can only rely on the GRA statistics.  If the Minister has the statistics, he can publish them and I will absolutely accept them.  However, if it is the case that there is anything approaching the number of garda&iacute; who cannot pursue criminals at high speed suggested by the GRA statistics, that is clearly a problem for the tackling of crime in rural areas and in large districts.<\/p> <p> The Bill seeks to address conditions of bail and electronic tagging.  We support some of the provisions in the Bill, have difficulties with others and would prefer to have the wording amended in others still.  The legislation has some significant flaws, but I hope these can be remedied on Committee Stage.  We will allow this Bill to go forward to Committee Stage so that these amendments can be tabled.  However, we will seek to amend the Bill before it is enacted because it contains quite significant flaws.  It is important that legislation of this kind is in compliance with international human rights and contains mechanisms based on evidence of what works, as opposed to gestures, and that is it constitutionally sound.<\/p> <p> The Bill contains a number of provisions which will change the law as it relates to bail.  Section 2(a) changes the wording of section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 to make it an imperative that the court shall refuse the application for bail if it is satisfied that such a refusal is considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious crime by that person.  The 1997 Act states, \"Where an application for bail is made by a person charged with a serious offence, a court shall refuse the application if the court is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.\"  The explanatory memorandum states that this will make it \"mandatory for a Court to refuse a bail application where such application is made by a person charged with a serious offence and where the Court is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.\"  I presume it is intended that people listening to this or reading the transcript will pay more attention to the word \"mandatory\" than to the phrase \"where the court is satisfied\".  Of course, it is still conditional and still at the discretion of the judge to be so satisfied.  To provide otherwise would be an unreasonable fettering of judicial discretion.  This is a matter of framing the decision - for it is still a decision for the judge to grant bail or not - as an imperative.  The Minister has spoken about this matter.  In previous debates, the point has been made that framing judicial decisions as imperatives has been considered constitutionally questionable.  Indeed, Deputy O'Callaghan made that point to me when we were discussing sentencing guidelines on the radio on one occasion.  I remain open-minded in this regard and will consider arguments as to what is the most appropriate wording.  However, it is important that judicial discretion is preserved.<\/p> <p> Section 2(b) concerns the strengthening of language in respect of judicial decisions about bail.  This amends the section of the Bail Act 1997 inserted by the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015, which allows a court to consider the fact that a  person who has committed relevant offences in the past in a dwelling as evidence that the person is likely to commit a relevant offence in a dwelling.  Section 2 of the Bill extends this to say that circumstances in which relevant offences have been committed in a dwelling shall be considered evidence of likelihood to commit a relevant offence and shall lead to a judge refusing an application of bail if he or she is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a relevant offence by that person.  Again, while this is framed in a way which suggests an imperative, the final decision remains with the judge and he or she has final jurisdiction.  However, the same question of constitutionality applies here.  If a judge feels that such a refusal is likely to be necessary to ensure that a crime will not be committed, it seems that he or she should properly refuse bail if she or he was properly convinced.  However, this is phrased as an imperative and so it may be constitutionally hazardous.  I retain an open mind and I will listen carefully to the rebuttal which I am sure Deputy O'Callaghan will give.<\/p> <p> We recognise that the right to bail is not unlimited.  It is not unreasonable for a court to have powers to make bail conditions such that bail can be withdrawn if these are broken or even to refuse bail to an accused who is a flight risk or who poses a demonstrable risk of interfering with witnesses or of committing an additional serious crime.  There will also cases where the nature of the crime is such - for example, extreme violence or violence against multiple victims - that the withholding of bail can be justified in the name of public safety.  It is our view that the protection of the presumption of innocence should be at the core of our justice system and that there should be a presumption of bail.  The general presumption in favour of bail is important.  The European Convention on Human Rights states that pre-trial detention should only be used as a measure of last resort.  There are rightly situations where this can be qualified or circumscribed, but I do not believe we should depart too far from that principle.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 2 may well do that.<\/p> <p> Paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 2 relate to the conditions in which a judge may refuse bail.  Of course, that hinges upon section 2(a) of this Bill to a considerable extent.  Taken in isolation, we have no difficulty with the judge having the discretion to refuse bail in circumstances outside what is currently considered.  This would allow for a situation whereby if a crime was previously committed in a dwelling, that it could be considered a circumstance in which bail could be refused.  I have read the memorandum and I am not quite sure that it equates to what is contained within the legislation.  The memorandum outlines that for which the Bill provides.  Where a serious offence has been committed and a judge is satisfied that there is a likelihood of reoffending, in a dwelling or otherwise, it would be logical to refuse bail.  To an extent, that is contingent on paragraphs (a) and (b).  The Minister has said that it is difficult to see how a provision requiring the court to accept a single offence as evidence could be permissible.  A different situation would pertain if we were looking at a provision that allows a court to accept a single offence as evidence of a risk of future offending.  If the crime is of a serious nature, containing a certain level of violence, we should allow judges to take that into consideration and potentially to refuse bail.  That may require that the first two subsections be changed so that they do not create an imperative to act.<\/p> <p> Section 3 relates to electronic tagging.  Making electronic tagging mandatory and removing the discretion of the judge is not an idea with which we agree.  It undermines the discretion of the Judiciary, and pushes for a wide application of a policy when we are not yet sure of its effectiveness.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not have an objection, in principle, to the use of such tagging.  There are circumstances in which it may provide an alternative to custody which make sense, particularly in cases involving very serious crimes, such as sexual crimes, but we do have some concerns about operability and cost-effectiveness.  There is a need for safeguards, and we do not agree with the blanket use of the measure as proposed in this Bill.  There is an element of removing judicial discretion involved.  We have had significant discussions in recent times about trusting the judgment of judges.  This is a decision which is traditionally a discretionary power and it should remain so.<\/p><p>Moreover, tagging is only as good as whoever is monitoring it.  Tagging will not tell one what someone is doing, merely where he or she is doing it or whether he or she is outside a particular area.  Clearly the attendant staffing of that activity is crucial to ensuring it works even in the circumstances in which it is applied, and there need to be safeguards there.<\/p> <p> Deputy Breathnach made a point about the case of Shane O'Farrell.  I would argue that the failures in that case were not particularly to do with the approval or refusal of bail.  They related to the failure to pursue breaches of Bail.  That is quite a significant issue which was highlighted by the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme before Christmas; bail breaches are not always pursued to the extent that they should be, where people are failing to report to a Garda station or where people have committed additional crimes or appeared before a court again.  That is certainly an area where we have had a breakdown and we need to focus quite considerably on ensuring that bail is enforced and applied. <\/p> <p> In the context of this debate, we need to be conscious of the impact on the prison population.  Pre-trial detainees make up between 13% and 15% of the prison population in the State.  Clearly there is a need for some defendants to be held on remand in order to ensure that they stand trial, but it does not come cheap for the Exchequer.  In 2014, the average cost of a staffed prison space was &euro;68,959, or an average of &euro;189 per prisoner per day.  If there are, on average, 520 or so remand prisoners held on a day, it costs the State approximately &euro;100,000 a day to hold prisoners on remand.  Obviously that is necessary on occasion, but we do need to take consideration of that. <\/p> <p> We also should take consideration of the fact that our prison population is quite substantial.  My understanding is that as of yesterday, Limerick Prison was at 179% capacity in respect of female prisoners.  The D&oacute;chas Centre is at 129% capacity.  There are approximately 4,000 prisoners in Irish prisons and the main remand prison already is more or less at capacity at 97%.  Obviously if we increase the number of pre-trial detainees, that will push the numbers even higher and that increases pressure on staff, restricts access to existing offender behaviour programmes and leads to physical overcrowding.  Finally, the Bill does not really address the need for bail supports, which I think represents a crucial issue in any discussion of pre-trial detention. <\/p> <p> We will not oppose the Bill proceeding to Second Stage.  As I have outlined, there are some provisions we can live with, some we would not and some we seek to amend.  In summing up, however, I believe the solutions to the problems described by numerous Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies - real problems of increased crime figures which I myself have outlined and dwelt upon - ultimately involve policing.  We must ensure that members of the Garda are in a position to respond quickly and are visible, as the visibility of police offers a far more effective form of discouragement than what is proposed here. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700044#WW00300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530117000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>In the first instance, I note that the Labour Party will support the Bill's passage to Second Stage.

While I need some further clarification, from my reading of the legislation this is the third attempt to legislate for electronic tagging.  This legislation seeks to do something which is already on the Statute Books and one wonders about the efficacy of such an effort.

As such, there are some reservations on that score. <\/p><p>I received a document today from the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, which tallies with the concerns of the Minister.  Spokespersons such as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire also outlined some of its contents or there is a coincidence between the points he makes and the contents of the IPRT submission.  I will quote from that document because it sums it up for me with regard to section 2(a) and fettering discretion of the Judiciary.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>It is important to note that the Court <i>already has <\/i>the power to refuse an application for bail under the 1997 Act (as amended) where they are satisfied that such refusal is reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  In response to concerns over a perceived increase in offending by people while on bail, Article 40.4.6, the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, was inserted in 1996 as a result of a referendum.  Section 2(1) of the Bail Act, 1997 gave effect to this amendment, providing that:<blockquote><blockquote><i>&quot;Where an application for bail is made by a person charged with a serious offence, a court <\/i><i><i>may<\/i><\/i><i>refuse the application if the court is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.&quot;<\/i><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>The issue of recidivism is a great worry to all of us in this House, regardless of our political hue and beliefs.

We have had some external commentary on the efficacy of that Bill.  In dealing with issues around offences committed, I am genuinely concerned that Members are legislating in a way that could put us offside with the Constitution.  We are attempting to deal with the issues that are societal or are due to a lack of resources in policing and so on.  The solution to all of those problems is not in the making of law which could subsequently be overturned if it is tested, or if it is challenged at a future date.

I support the Minister's point on the Bill's constitutionality.  This is supported in the submission by the IPRT.  We have to be cautious about how we legislate for these matters in this House.  I stood before the Ceann Comhairle to support the O'Farrell family.  There was a litany of abuses and failures of the system in that case, but that should not mean we should legislate in haste and repent thereafter if there is a risk the legislation might be overturned.  That serves nobody and it does not do anybody any good in dealing with the issues at hand.<\/p> <p> I have a question about the explanatory memorandum, which I hope Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan can address, and the statement that 13% of all crimes being committed by people out on bail.

There is an issue as to whether the Bill is constitutional, and on Committee Stage we will soon find out whether that is the case.  There are more than 200 Private Members' Bills, as I understand it, and we as individual Members have to check the Executive authority of the House.  For too long the Executive ruled the roost and it is no harm the balance has shifted back towards the ordinary Members of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700046#YY00800","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530117600,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate, although it is not a debate to which I wanted to contribute because the Bill plays to the crowd and looks for the simplest form of kudos it can.  I was not going to speak on it because I did not feel it was worthwhile.  Having examined the submission of the IPRT, and examined the Bill itself I felt it was important to speak on it and register my objection to, and complains about it.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is an attempt at raising the flag of populism to make it look as though we are being strong and doing something on bail and criminality, but it will not do anything except probably make the situation a lot worse if it is enacted.  Our neighbours next door said they were tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, and that was their mantra.  It is also the mantra that could be used about the Bill.  It is too simple to think if we stop bail, we will solve the problems with criminality throughout the State.  I do not believe it would do so.  The IPRT outlined the improvements it could make to the bail system.  If we implemented them, that would have a greater impact on people who are on bail for crimes and criminal offences and on recidivism, which is important.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the people in our criminal justice system are addicts or unemployed or in need of support from the State rather than in need of being made criminals.  Putting people in jail while they are waiting for their court case to come up will increase the crime levels because there is no better place to learn how to become a good criminal than jail.  If we are serious about preventing crime, we should put in place the supports outlined in the submission from the IPRT because then we could do something to prevent crime being committed by people on bail.  However, that is too difficult.  It is not simple and it would be very hard to justify to the public that we were introducing a system to make bail more humane and make it work for people to reduce crime in the State.  The cost has been outlined clearly.  The cost of jailing people will increase significantly and will place more demands on the criminal justice system, which will move more money away from preventing recidivism, but at least they will all be in jail anyway so that will be good.  In 2017, the average cost of a staffed prison place in the State was &euro;68,000 per year or &euro;188 per day.  We are stating we should increase this amount and ensure more money will be spent on it.  That &euro;188 per day would probably ensure that 40 or 50 people would not commit a crime again if we invested it where it would be far more useful than jailing people for offences.<\/p>  <p>  A previous speaker spoke about people being in jail for offences.  Much has been made about how the figures have been manipulated in terms of the CSO.  It will not quote Garda figures for murders now because it cannot stand over them.  How many of the figures relating to people who commit offences are genuine?  If somebody is arrested for a particular offence, the garda will put it to him that ten or 20 other offences of a similar type took place and that if he admits to all those offences his court date will go a lot easier.  People admit to committing crimes that they might not have had anything to do with.  That improves the solved crime rate and it looks good in the reports that go to the Government and are published every year.  The crimes included in these great figures might not have been solved at all.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill should put in place more proactive supports and ways to make bail effective in order that people can do more than just sit around waiting for their trial to take place.  We also have to  question why it takes so long for trials to take place.  Perhaps this is something else we address to make the bail regime more effective.<\/p>  <p>  There always will be cases where people on bail commit crimes.  That is wrong but this is a knee-jerk way of resolving those cases.  There have to be other ways of doing so and we should ensure they are followed rather than putting forward defective laws such as this.  The Bill might have the right to go to Committee Stage and be sorted out there, but it would be more worthwhile to use that time be used for Bills that have had their constitutionality checked and that Members can stand over before Second Stage is taken.  I will be opposing the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1530118200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  We need to examine the overcrowding in our prisons.  Figures from yesterday indicate that five of our 12 prisons are over capacity.  Currently, all Irish prisons hold close to 4,000 prisoners and our main remand prison in Cloverhill is now at 97% capacity.  This is an urgent matter.  We have a growing population and yet our prisons are nearly at full capacity.  We need to look at solutions to the problem as burying our heads in the sand is not good enough.  We must re-examine the sending of women to prison for small-time crime.  This is done in the UK.  When women committed petty crimes in that country in the past, they were being sentenced to prison but now there are alternatives, including training, before getting the women into the world again.  These people will have learned the error of their ways after small crimes.<\/p>  <p>  We must consider how to protect people in rural Ireland, especially those living in isolated areas.  I come from a rural area in west Cork and I know only too well the fear about crime in our communities, particularly among isolated people who live alone.  They may be elderly and vulnerable.  Where bail has been granted, electronic monitoring should be a mandatory condition.  I understand electronic monitoring cannot, in itself, prevent a person from committing a crime, it is certainly a deterrent.  We must do everything we can to make the people living in rural Ireland feel safe again.<\/p>  <p>  I have stood here many times in this House highlighting the Government's failure to rural-proof its actions.  There have been prolonged closures of rural Garda stations around the country, which is without doubt the biggest contributing factor to rural crime.  There are three coastal Garda stations in my constituency, among many others, that have faced closure.  These are Goleen, Adrigole and Ballinspittle.  The people of Ballinspittle are working very hard as a community to get their Garda station reopened.  The Minister for Justice and Equality was here earlier and I hope he will be back in a moment to clarify the position in this regard.  I see from media reports that he visited the Stepaside Garda station.  It is one of six Garda stations that are to reopen.  If he visited the Stepaside Garda station on Monday, surely he will visit Ballinspittle and the other four that remain closed?  They are very important to their communities.  If these stations are reopened, it might at least help to discourage those who are committing crimes and allay people's fears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700048#AAA00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1530118200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak to the Bill and I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for bringing it forward.  One of the main provisions of the Bill is that in considering bail, a court shall refuse application if the court is satisfied that such a refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Two weeks ago, we debated the setting up of a commission of inquiry into the tragic slaughter of Mr. Shane O'Farrell.  We can consider the number of times the gentleman responsible for that crime was on bail.  Surely he was a threat, particularly as he was wanted in Northern Ireland.  This is not as good as it looks.<\/p>  <p>  It will come as a major shock to people to hear that this is not already part of existing legislation for bail.  We are way behind the curve in trying to deal with bail laws.  There is a laxity in the law and there is a real need to pursue Private Members' options like that which we are debating this evening.  There is a clear need to reform spending on legal aid in bail laws.  The spending is phenomenal.  There is an absence of any mention of the widespread abuse of legal aid in our bail laws, which is incomprehensible.  There is an open door or cheque book, which is simply unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 of the 2016 bail legislation referred to the number and frequency of any previous convictions of the accused person for serious offending and it stopped short of linking this to legal aid but it must be linked.  Parliamentary questions I have submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality reveal that total expenditure for criminal legal aid for 2011 to 2015 amounted to &euro;252.2 million, which is a staggering amount.  The figure does not include a further &euro;162.3 million spent on civil legal aid.  In light of this level of funding, the Department and Minister must conduct an analysis of the link between abuse of legal aid and the application of bail laws.  They are interlinked.  Access to legal aid, especially in cases where bail is persistently violated, must be reviewed and taken into account the next time a person applies for bail.  It is not fun and games we are having.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Bill refers to electronically monitoring a person's movements while on bail so it can be established if he or she commits an offence while on bail.  This is a no-brainer because there is an issue here.  The Minister has informed me that provision has already been made in this regard.  Has it been implemented, however?  I want him to clarify that and, in particular, how many times the provision has been used.  The Minister is aware that I raised this matter with his predecessor, Deputy Francis Fitzgerald, when I sought to clarify why it had taken ten years to enforce a provision of the Criminal Justice Act sanctioning the use of electronic tagging.  It is too long.  The former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the current Minister, Deputy Flanagan, must step up to the plate and sort out this tagging straight away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700048#AAA00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1530118200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Deputy Mattie McGrath has taken all the time.

This applies especially to those people convicted before courts for other crimes.

Without a doubt, this is the problem of bail and reoffenders on bail committing serious or minor crimes.  If we want to squeeze crime, we must view it all as serious, whether it is a handbag being stolen or a more serious offence.  Without a doubt, the current position is unacceptable and the people of Ireland are fed up of seeing a revolving door system.  Individual cases must of course be looked at, which is why we have judges.  It is wrong, however, that people are getting bail when they have committed serious crimes and getting the opportunity to create chaos again in society.  I ask the Government to look at what is happening.  It is about time the bail issue was overhauled with a view to being sympathetic and understanding of the victim of crime.

The fact that this D&aacute;il is prepared to tackle the issue and to do so in the correct way will be welcomed by many.  I hope the House will see its way to support this particular legislation.<\/p> <p> The Bill is a serious attempt to address, once and for, all the situation of reoffenders.  Members of the public are watching this and they see it.  They will tell us of the recurring scenario whereby people who reoffend seem to get bail easily.  That has to stop.  We must have more respect for the victims of crime.  Many people believe that the victim is twice a victim because the State does not deal with some of these reoffenders.  A total of 26,000 crimes, including 6,214 thefts and 1,377 burglaries, were committed in 2016.  It can be seen from these figures that in many of these cases a considerable percentage of the perpetrators reoffend.  I imagine the figures for 2017 are not much better.<\/p> <p> The Government cry will be that crime levels have fallen.  I have raised the matter in the D&aacute;il previously.  A considerable number of people, especially in rural Ireland, will not report minor crimes any more.  Only recently, a man who had some tools taken from his farmyard said he did not bother to report the incident.  The point he made to me was that the offenders get out on bail time after time.  I urge everyone to report every crime, no matter how small.  It is important that victims report crimes.  This victim made the point to me - many others have made the point to me as well &ndash; that a situation arises whereby these people continuously get bail.<\/p> <p> I have long said that none of the Garda stations should ever have been closed.  The amount of money that has been saved is so small.  The fact that a village or town has a Garda station, even though it is not manned 24-7 or even eight or ten hours per day, is a help.  The fact that garda&iacute; are back and forth to the station and that there is a Garda sign in the town or village is something of a deterrent.  There was a Garda station in my village of Termonbarry on the N5 national primary route.  The River Shannon runs by it and the N5 is a major route.  The Garda station was closed.  It should never have been closed.

I compliment my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, on bringing this legislation forward and presenting us with an opportunity to address this problem.  The Bill attempts to redress the balance between the victim and offenders for one specific type of crime, that is, domestic burglary.  The aim of the Bill is to target prolific offenders by requiring the courts to refuse applications for bail.  The Bill also refers to the use of electronic monitoring and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the contributions of previous speakers.  Many raised concerns about the balance between the victim and the offender, as well as the presumption of innocence.  It is worth recalling that one in eight of all crimes committed in 2017 was committed by someone who was out on bail for another offence.  Therein lies the scale of the issue.  Burying our heads in the sand and doing nothing are simply not options.  I was pleased to hear the contributions of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies.  They said they had issues with some aspects of the Bill but they are prepared to allow it to advance so that those issues could be addressed appropriately on Committee Stage.  I welcome that move.  It is the correct way of dealing with legislation.  The detail can be dealt with adequately.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Penal Reform Trust was mentioned numerous times.  We have all received information from the trust.  It has specifically stated that if we introduce this measure, it will place further pressure on an already overcrowded prison system and give rise to significant cost implications.  The trust goes on to say that yesterday, 26 June, a total of five out of 12 Irish prisons were operating over capacity.  That is no excuse for not doing the right thing by having the right legislation.  If resources or more prison spaces are needed, then so be it.  No one would realistically suggest that we have insufficient prison space for a person who committed a serious crime or was convicted of murder.  That is a ludicrous argument to put forward.  The corollary of five out of 12 prisons being overcrowded is that the other seven are not overcrowded.  My understanding is that in recent times there are fewer people in prison than previously.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, like several other initiatives relating to crime, the Bill is not being supported by the Government.  Numerous speakers have referred to the whole area of crime.  If we are to have effective control of crime, the first steps that must be addressed relate to the number of garda&iacute; and the need for the physical presence of garda&iacute;.  The Minister of State will reply that the number of garda&iacute; is increasing.  We get this time and again but I want to make two points.  If the number of garda&iacute; is increasing, it is important that there is visibility on the street and in our communities.  In any event, it is not happening because garda&iacute; are preoccupied with other duties.  Civilianisation requires a clear and distinct roadmap to show how we will free up more garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to outline my view on Dublin specifically.  I have received the replies time and again.  From my work in my constituency and as a member of the joint policing committee I see more and more crimes being committed.  The crimes range from scramblers in our park to antisocial behaviour.  Every time I question the Minister on the issue specifically, he says that we have more garda&iacute;.  I have checked the figures.  It is galling and drives me absolutely mad that there is no apparent decrease in the problem in Dublin.  The number of garda&iacute; nationally last year increased in 2017 by over 600.  I get that time and again.  However, what the Minister does not always say is that the number of garda&iacute; in Dublin decreased by 100.  Therein lies a large part of the problem.  If we are going to deal effectively with this issue, it is not only a matter of the legislation but of all the other issues to which I have referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700049#BBB00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1530118800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I compliment our justice spokesman, Deputy O'Callaghan, on bringing forward this Bill.  I was in my office earlier when the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, was responding to the contribution of Deputy O'Callaghan.  I was very disappointed with the Minister's contribution on the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  There is a serious problem.  The public are annoyed about the amount of crimes committed when people are on bail.  Ordinary people are frustrated in rural and urban areas.  They are told that a person is out on bail for three, four, five, six, seven or eight offences.  Yet, nothing is done to change it.  We had the family of Shane O'Farrell in the House in the recent past.  We had a motion discussing Shane O'Farrell's particular case.  The person who murdered Shane O'Farrell had been in court eight times in the previous seven or eight months but was never put into custody.  That is an extreme example of the way the bail laws and the system are failing people.  His family's loss can never be recovered, but the least we can do is change the system so that can never happen again.<\/p>  <p>  When I travel around rural areas, I knock on the doors.  Ten or 15 years ago I could have simply pushed and door and it would have opened.  Now, only a window will open or someone will squint out at me to see who is there.  People are living in fear.<\/p>  <p>  Amending the bail laws will not solve all the issues or stop all the crime.  However, repeat offenders have to be taken out of circulation.  The Minister referred to person's rights.  What about the people against whom the crimes are committed?  What about their rights?  When repeat offenders are out on bail they believe they have a licence and that they will only get one sentence for whatever amount of crimes they commit.  This has to change.  As Deputy Curran said, this Bill may be imperfect and it may be that some things in it need to be changed but certainly the laws in force at the moment on how bail operates are wrong and have to change.  Let this Bill be a first step to ensure that repeat offenders, when they come into the judicial system, are kept in custody.  That way the people in rural and urban Ireland will feel safer.  In this way, we will take the first step to reduce crime figures and ensure that the people who commit these crimes are dealt with quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700049#BBB00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1530119400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I have listened to the debate with some interest.  Earlier, the Minister agreed that an unacceptable amount of crime is being committed by people who have been charged with other offences and who are out on bail.  However, the Government has already introduced changes to the bail laws to tackle this problem.  The Minister argues that we need to give these changes, introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2017, time to have an impact and we need to assess that impact before we introduce further changes.  Among the provisions of the 2017 Act were amendments to facilitate the introduction and targeted use of electronic monitoring, so that proposal is already on the Statute Book.  Much work has been done in my Department and in criminal justice agencies to implement those provisions.  The Minister and I are confident that electronic monitoring, when used in this way, will be valuable in monitoring those on bail in certain circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The primary aim of the Bill before us is to make the refusal of bail mandatory where a court is satisfied that it is necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by the person.  The Minister is advised that these proposals are inconsistent with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Because of the constitutional difficulties relate to the main aim of the Bill, namely, mandatory refusal of bail in particular circumstances, it does not appear that any amendment could make the provisions constitutional without also undermining that aim.  When considering issues relating to bail, we must also consider that the accused person has not been convicted of the offence.  He or she must be presumed innocent and has a right to liberty.  These are fundamental rights that can only be curtailed in very limited circumstances.  The proposals in this Bill, in the Minster's view, go too far in curtailing the right of the court to consider all the relevant factors before restricting a person's liberty.  For that reason, the Government is not in a position to support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister noted earlier, Operation Thor is a concrete example of how investing in Garda resources, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in budget 2018, has impacted on crime.  Following the implementation of the winter phase of Operation Thor, there were 43% fewer burglaries of homes reported in March 2018 compared with October 2017.  A significant drop in burglary offences conducted by persons has also been reported since Operation Thor was launched.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and others referred to victims.  Last year, we implemented the Victims of Crime Act.  This has gone a long way towards supporting victims.  It is not true to say that victims are not considered.  I agree with Deputy Eugene Murphy who said that it is important to report every crime, no matter how small, because it adds to the knowledge and intelligence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Curran referred to prisons operating over capacity.  There are certain pressures on prisons at the moment, partly due to the success of Operation Thor in targeting criminal gangs and roving criminals and bringing them before the courts, resulting in custodial sentences.  It is a sign of the success of the criminal justice agencies that the prisons are under pressure.  We must keep an eye on this situation.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the aim behind the Bill but, unfortunately, the Government is advised that it is inconsistent with the Constitution.

It can be very traumatic for people who lose heirlooms as valuable items, passed from generation to generation, are lost for ever.<\/p><p>In a recent interview with<i>The Irish Times, <\/i>Assistant Commissioner John O'Driscoll said that last autumn, when the garda had drawn up a list of burglary gangs it wanted to target during the winter phase of Operation Thor, the sheer extent of some of their criminal records stood out.  In his view, the sentences imposed by the courts are failing to act as a deterrent for prolific burglars.  This must be addressed and Fianna F&aacute;il remains committed to the establishment of a judicial sentencing commission.  Unfortunately statistics show that this type of crime is repeated time and again by offenders.  Bail is not a deterrent.<\/p><p>The primary aim of the Bill is to target prolific offenders by requiring the court to refuse and application for bail to a person charged with a serious offence where the court is satisfied that such refusal is necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  It also makes provision for the electronic monitoring of persons as a condition of bail in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>Strong community relations are the bedrock of an effective police force.  However, reductions in the number of community garda&iacute; across the country have damaged local links with the force.  We need to cover all Garda districts to ensure that a community garda is based in the area and has strong links with the community.  Communities have not sat back on this.  In many areas, the community alert system have been set up.  This system is very effective.  In collaboration with local garda&iacute;. a text system has been established whereby local information is fed Garda station manned on a 24-hour basis.  The information is checked and, if correct, then texted to locals who can be alert to any situation and be the eyes and ears of the community.<\/p><p>If we are serious about tackling crime, this Bill should be allowed to progress to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700050#CCC00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1530119400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, for bringing this Bill forward.  It would be the fulfilment of the wishes of the people in a referendum held in the aftermath of the murder of Veronica Guerin.  We need to get tough on crime and on criminals.  The Department of Justice and Equality and the Government is not doing a sufficient job.  It is not remotely interested in dealing with crime.  Statistics have been massaged over recent years.  The Central Statistics Office continues to regard them as being under reservation, which is extraordinary.  I sincerely hope that the Garda Commissioner designate, Drew Harris - who I wish well - gets to grips with the matter of statistics.  In that context I urge everyone to report every crime to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that they are all recorded.<\/p>  <p>  We see the failure of the Government's approach to criminal justice in the statistics that have been released on my own constituency today.  Burglaries in the Ashbourne area have increased from 96 to 136; in Dunboyne from 47 to 84; in Laytown from 73 to 76; in Kells, a quiet town, they have doubled from 27 to 54; in Nobber they have increased from 12 to 18; and in Navan from 114 to 147.  This is the Minister of State's record.  It is the wishy-washy approach that we have become used to from Deputy Stanton's party , which used to be known as the part of law and order.  That wishy-washy approach has to end.<\/p>  <p>  Judges must be given their constitutionally proper roles but they must also be given guidance from the Oireachtas on the basis of the message of the people in the bail referendum more than 20 years ago.  We must keep people on bail who are at serious risk of committing offences.  Garda&iacute; in my area have arrested various suspects in respect of burglaries committed there.  They do fantastic work in bringing people to justice.  However, while garda&iacute; do their job and bring people to court, immediately these boys - and they are mainly boys - are let out on bail.  They are gone again to rob, burgle, plunder and maim.  That must end.  The Minister of State must show the seriousness of his intent and his approach by supporting Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  I sincerely hope that the House supports this Bill tomorrow because we have had enough.<\/p><p>The crime rate is too high and people are concerned.  This has been a major issue on social media and so on in Dunboyne.  The people there have noted that the number of burglaries has increased.  They probably have not noted that it has almost doubled, but that is the feeling on the ground.  The word is out there.  People know what is happening to their neighbours.  It is the same in Ashbourne, Kells, Navan, Nobber and throughout my constituency.  I suspect the picture is the same throughout the country.  I thank Deputy O'Callaghan and I call on the House to support this legislation tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700050#CCC00300","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530120000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank all Members who contributed to the debate on the legislation.  Many Members spoke in support of it.  I will not deal directly with the comments they have made in my response but I appreciate their support.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise that this is not some simple solution to the problem we have in this country in respect of crime.  I fully recognise and agree that to resolve or cut down on the incidence of crime, a multifaceted approach is required.  It is primarily an issue of resources.  While it is about having more garda&iacute; on the street, it is also about ensuring that we as legislators put in place legislation we think is effective and will be useful in vindicating the rights of individuals.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise and accept the presumption of innocence and how it should apply.  I fully respect and honour the principles of personal liberty in the Constitution.  However, I also fully respect other provisions in the Constitution which were inserted relatively recently, and not in 1937, as referred to by my colleague, Deputy Byrne.  We have to remember that in a referendum in 1996 the people voted to change the provision dealing with personal liberty so that a court could refuse bail being sought by a person charged with a serious offence where the court reasonably considered it necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  That is as much part of our Constitution as the other provisions in respect of personal liberty.  We need to recognise that people who are subjected to serious criminal attack are entitled to have their rights vindicated as well.<\/p>  <p>  That brings me on to the issue this legislation seeks to deal with.  We cannot get away from the fact that we have a problem in respect of individuals who are out on bail committing offences.  The Government, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and everyone else in the House agrees on that issue.  Where we have some dispute is on the question of how we resolve that.  Current legislation provides that a court may refuse an individual bail in respect of the commission of a serious offence if the court believes it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is correct that the provision I have included in my legislation will preserve court discretion.  The court will still have to determine whether it is likely that an applicant for bail will commit an offence in the future.  That necessarily involves consideration.  In his response, the Minister of State said that the Bill is blunt because it does not take into account an applicant for bail having a serious illness or a disability, for instance.  Of course that will be taken into account by the court considering the application.  The court will consider it unlikely that somebody with a disability or serious illness will commit an offence in the future.  That discretion is preserved.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to recognise that judges do not make law.  We are the sole law-making body in this country.  The people passed a referendum in 1996 and we need to give effect to it.  I fully appreciate the comments of Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and Sherlock who have concerns about the Bill.  I will certainly take those concerns on board if the Bill passes Second Stage.  I am happy to talk to the Deputies.  The Government has simply said that the Bill is unconstitutional and that, therefore, it will not proceed with it.  In light of what the people voted for in 1996, I do not know how it can be baldly stated that the Bill is unconstitutional.  People voted for this change and we have a responsibility to implement it in statute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700051#DDD00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530120000,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1530120000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 28 June 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700051#DDD00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017: Report Stage (Resumed)","time":1530120000,"counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700051#DDD00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530120000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 22.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530120000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 22 was moved by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on 13 June 2018:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530120000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 22:<\/p><p>-(Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1530120000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Deputy Mattie McGrath was in control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700051#DDD00900","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1530120000,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach.

I again appeal to the good offices of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to take this opportunity to withdraw the remarks he made about us in the Rural Independent Group and the personalised attack he made on me in front of my daughter.  I have asked him a number of times but I will give him the opportunity again.  He seems to have lost his voice when it comes to answering any of the questions we ask in the Chamber, and we have asked him many questions.  Indeed questions are arising by the day and the Minister does not seem to be able to answer them.<\/p><p>I want to specifically address the issue of learner drivers and the criminalisation of a cohort of young people, the vast majority of whom are good people.  There is an old adage - mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  I was contacted by a young boy of 18 earlier.  He did his driver's test and unfortunately failed.  He has a job that requires him to travel from my own village to Dungarvan.  He now cannot travel because his mother is unable to drive him.  It is a single-parent family and she cannot accompany him.  He bought the car, he has the insurance, he did his lessons and his tuition and he was hopeful.  It is a nerve-wracking engagement for a young person.  I do not know why he failed but he failed.  He cannot reapply for a month.  That is a basic example of denial of human rights.  If he could reapply this evening and get that test within a week or ten days that could be accepted, but he cannot reapply for a month.  He could then be waiting for as long as five months in Tipperary.  If he then attempts to drive unaccompanied on the road to satisfy the employer who gave him the job on a farm in Dungarvan in Deputy Mary Butler's constituency, this legislation would make him a criminal despite the fact that he has insurance.  It would also criminalise his mother.  The Minister might answer this.  If it is this man's own car and he owns it, can the parent be criminalised, fined and given penalty points as well?  That is what the Minister is doing and that is discrimination.  We will call that young chap John because, to quote the old <i>Irish Press<\/i>report, that is what he likes to be called.  Is &eacute; sin a ainm.  Would this happen if he got a job in Dublin?<\/p><p>He might not get a job milking cows in Dublin but, whatever job he gets, he can get the DART, Luas, bus or taxi.  He could cycle, using the very successful rent-a-bike scheme, or use many other forms of transport.  Why should a man in Tipperary be criminalised for doing the very same thing as someone in Dublin, namely, having the noble goal of seeking work, finishing his education or bettering himself in some way?  Why should he be stigmatised as a criminal for having the noble aspiration of finishing his education, getting a job, doing a training course in agriculture or doing driving lessons to pass his test?  He is victimised and criminalised.  That is how I see it.  If the Minister does not listen here, some of the young buachaill&iacute; or cail&iacute;n&iacute; will challenge this because it is downright naked, basic discrimination against young boys and girls from rural areas.  One cannot say otherwise.  That is what it is.  We are receiving complaints on why we are debating this Bill.  This is a part of the Bill that the Minister recommitted to include in this legislation.<\/p> <p>I met Mr. Clancy from Fermoy or north-east Cork recently and I totally sympathised with him and thanked him for engaging with me on the tragic loss of his wife and daughter.  It is so sad but a sad case and desperate, hard cases make bad laws.  They do not make good laws.  It is the greater good that we have to try to serve here.  We do not want to see anyone driving recklessly.  We do not want to see anyone trying to commit crimes.  As I said, we sympathise completely with the family in question and any other in the same situation.  It is so sad.  We can never walk in their shoes but we have to be balanced about our assessment and understanding of legislation and our attempts to debate with the Minister and his officials on this.<\/p> <p> The shutters are down, however, and they will not be lifted.  There is no engagement, at committee level, here or elsewhere, including privately.  We have to be realists as rural Independent Deputies.  The Acting Chairman is a rural Deputy.  Every rural Deputy knows the difficulties, including the lack of rural transport services, the state of rural roads and the punitive cost imposed on families trying to pass their national car tests and keep their cars taxed, insured and on the roads.  The costs are punitive enough without criminalising families for what is outside their control.  They are unable to work under this legislation.  They will be unable to keep within this legislation.  If they do, they will be unable to finish their education and enter employment.<\/p> <p> At present there is nearly full employment.  There is a huge shortage of staff in the catering industry and in the hospitality sector.  Chefs cannot be got.  There is already a crisis among farm contractors.  We have heard this from Farm Contractors Ireland and all the agriculture bodies.  They have referred to the lack of apprenticeships and to how badly apprenticeship schemes are needed across the board, especially in the industries I have mentioned.  I refer to fishing, farming, contracting, the construction industry and the hospitality sector.  One can put on all the apprenticeship courses one likes but how will the places be filled?<\/p> <p> LIT Tipperary has campuses in Thurles and Clonmel.  They are working together, with imagination, to try to offer imaginative apprenticeship schemes to meet the needs and allow young people achieve their full potential in rural and urban areas.  In one fell swoop, the Minister is saying we will allow people participate but that we will not allow them on the road, or allow them to participate unless they live in a city or well-serviced town.  There are not many towns where one can get transport to go to college in Waterford, Tipperary, Limerick or Cork.  They do not have bus or train services, nor the DART, Luas and all the other services, such as the bicycle scheme in Dublin.<\/p> <p> The Minister visited Tiobraid &Aacute;rann theas last Friday in a kind of scurry or flurry.  He told me I would not be welcome to meet him on Wednesday night even though I was invited by the transport company.  I thank the company for that.  The Minister went to Kerry and announced so-called funding to put on bus services for people who wanted to socialise or have a social evening in certain places.  As I said at the start, the amount of money, &euro;490,000, would not administer a half decent scheme in two or three counties.  We have Ring a Link servicing Tipperary, Kilkenny and Carlow.  I am a founding member.  It has a top-class booking system.  It is state-of-the-art.  I asked the Minister to visit the headquarters in Kilkenny.  He might.  I would appreciate it if he did.  I did not hear any mention of any effort to provide transport by way of helping the families or anybody I am talking about so the young people can go to college to finish their education or take up apprenticeships.  There was no mention whatsoever of that.  How can the Minister just pick out one part of the Bill and say we will make an effort, feeble as it might be, to try to help the people in rural Ireland to socialise, visit their friends or visit the next town, albeit on a restricted basis?  Funding received for any service has to be welcomed, but how can one discriminate?  The Minister picked Tipperary and Kerry, for reasons unknown-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700051#DDD01200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530120600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>On a point of order, this amendment, in the name of Deputy Fitzmaurice, deals with the length of time people wait for a driving test.

I represent a cohort of people who want to be able to live in the country, finish their education there and to have some modicum of rural life.  They do not want to be isolated or sitting, as the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, said looking at iPhones.  They want to get out there into the jobs market and finish their education like the people in Dublin.  I do not stop the people in Dublin or other cities having it.  Let them do what they do.  We are entitled.  Fair play is fine play with me.  That is all I am looking for and no more.  I want them to be allowed sit the driving tests.<\/p>  <p>  Some argue I am not dealing with the matter.  However, what if one cannot get a test?  Take John, who I had mentioned earlier, who failed his test today.  He cannot reapply for a month.  Cen f&aacute;th?  Why can he not reapply immediately online and get it in a reasonable time?  I am a small businessman, as are Teachta&iacute; Michael Healy-Rae and Michael Collins.  If we could not do a job today and told the customer it would be a month later, we would not be long in business.  This is a monopoly and it is ridiculous.  The Minister is interested in sorting it out.  I heard yesterday some eminent gentlemen from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, say on the radio that, if this Bill is passed, it would employ 160 new testers.  Why can it not employ them beforehand?  Why do we have to wait until the Bill is passed?  How many more carrots are going to be dangled in front of us?<\/p>  <p>  I know what that is.  I have figures from a parliamentary question I got from the Minister not so long ago.  It stated the Department had recruited fewer than 20 and only half have been put in place.  This has gone on over 18 months.  What is the reason for the delay?  Someone suggested to me that the trade unions are holding it up.  What is going on?  I asked that question but the Minister will not answer any question.  I do not expect the Minister to be infallible and to know everything.  However, he should know what is going on in his Department.  It is chaos, bedlam and anarchy in his Department.<\/p>  <p>  For any Deputy to stand up here to suggest that I or my colleagues were responsible for the 28 deaths on the roads in recent times is abhorrent and unbelievable.  In future, the Minister should check those issues and not be hung up on two issues which are totally discriminatory against rural Ireland and rural dwellers.  The Minister sat in Government formation talks with me for 60 days two years ago.  We talked about rural-proofing legislation.  The Minister did not know about it but his colleagues, such as Deputy Fitzmaurice, did.  What do we get here?  Legislation which is anti-rural, anti-young people and anti-elderly.  This is naked and basic anti-young men and women.  It prevents them achieving their full potential while criminalising them and their parents.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister tell me why John cannot get a test in the next five or six days so he can try a second time?  He can get some more tuition and lessons which will cost him a considerable amount of money.  That is the business the testers are in.  I salute them because it is needed.  We had no lessons when I did my test and neither did the Minister.  How many thousands of people got driving licences over the counter when we could not cope with testing?  I think the Minister was in the Seanad at the time.  I was not but it was during Ger Connolly's time as Minister of State with responsibility for licences a long time ago.  The Minister is here long enough to know that.  These people got their licences back then, no problem.  However, young people do everything right, get lessons and their parents to show them how to drive, go to simulator tracks, get a car, get their insurance and try to get on the road but they fail their tests.  They cannot even reapply for one month.  In certain counties, the length of time they have to wait varies.  However, it is up to five months in Tipperary.  For six months, these young people will have to sit at home, watch television, doss around, lose a job or a place in college or eat cake as Marie Antoinette said.  That is the Minister's attitude.<\/p>  <p>  That is total discrimination against my people and the people of rural Ireland who I am paid here to represent.  This is bad law and it should not be passed.  It is unworkable.  We then have the RSA presiding over that.  The Minister was railing against the quangos and the quango queens but he appoints two more members to the authority without any accountability.  I give the Minister credit for standing down the whole codology about linking the licence to the PPS number and the public services card.  After &euro;1.8 million was wasted, he pulled the plug on it.  I commend him for that.  Who has been reprimanded?  Who has been disciplined?<\/p>  <p>  I asked all Departments about the number of staff who have been disciplined or sacked.  The only reply I got was from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty.  She informed me 13 people had been dismissed from her Department for a failure to act in the public good over a certain period.  Has anyone in the RSA or the Department been disciplined or held to account for these failures?  No, the Minister goes on dancing their merry tune, bringing in more silly legislation on top of what he already has, to placate them and make them justify their existence.  We cannot get a test in Tipperary; one cannot reapply for a month.  If one is disbarred from applying for a month, one should not be made a criminal.<\/p>  <p>  I know people who have done their driving test ten times.  The more times they do it, the worse it gets because it becomes a fear factor.<\/p>  <p>  These young people in question, as well as some elderly people, are returned emigrants.  If people are out of the country for four years, their licence lapses.  They must do a theory test, driving lessons and apply for the test.  I like to see foreign direct investment.  We have 5,000 jobs in the greater Clonmel and Tipperary area.  When these multinational people come here, do we insult them by insisting they do their theory tests to drive in Ireland?  I wonder.  I have never come across this.  It is like other legislation with sweeteners.  Is a blind eye turned to those industrialists who want to come here because we need them?  Is it like the passports for sale scandal we had in the past?  I wonder where the fairness in that is.<\/p>  <p>  What have our people done to the Minister?  What about Irish people?  What has the Minister and his RSA advisers got against them?  It is a kind of vendetta against them that they want to make criminals of them when they want to educate themselves, fulfil their employment dreams and when they want to facilitate the growing economy.  People are needed to work as we are short of workers.  What have they ever done to the Minister?  I do not know.<\/p><p>It is a personal vendetta.  The Minister just has a personal issue with these people as well as the ordinary folk in rural Ireland, who have little or no transport or any way of getting anywhere.<\/p> <p> Then there are the huge issues of mental health.  What impact is this having on the mental health of our young people?  All kinds of courses are made available now, and all kinds of social workers and supports are put into educational facilities, workplaces, schools and sporting areas - rightly so.  We must all be very conscious of mental health issues.  What kind of a body blow is this to young John, who must give up his job and park the car he bought and in respect of which he has paid insurance?  What kind of an impact will this have on his mental health?  Let us think about that.<\/p> <p> We are here passing legislation relating to mental health, wearing the green ribbon and raising issues of mental health.  However, what kind of impact will this have on young men and women, or indeed older men and women who come back to Ireland, having spent perhaps 40 years abroad in the United States or elsewhere, and who are put through a theory test and a driving test, when they have driven in America and far busier places than Erin go bragh?  Is anyone taking any cognisance of the impact this is having on these people and on hard-pressed families, parents and guardians?  Does anyone have any understanding of, empathy for or interest in how this is affecting the parent who wants to get his or her kids motivated, get them out there, active and engaged, and get them on the road?  If they are not on the road, they are condemned to waste time sitting in front of a computer - as if they have broadband.  Many of them do not.  They will mope around and their mental health will suffer directly because of actions the Minister is taking here.  He dresses this up in flowery language, telling us it is for road safety and this and that.<\/p> <p> The Minister will not back up his statistics.  Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe is as l&aacute;thair but has asked me to raise with the Minister a parliamentary question he has refused to answer about repeat offenders in respect of road traffic accidents.  The Minister will not allow the question to be answered by his Department.  I have the question here in my file and the reply from the Minister.  Deputy O'Keeffe is unavailable - he will be in later - but he has asked me to find out from the Minister tonight why he will not put his money where his mouth is and tell us the reasons for this.  The Minister refers to driving incidents.  He has predicted on data from my county alone that the number of breathalyser tests carried out was exaggerated by 330%.  I am straying a little now.  I ask the Minister these questions in the context of the question he refuses to answer.<\/p> <p> These are young people for whom I will die if I have to.  They are entitled to a modicum of living standards, just as anyone in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Port L&aacute;irge n&oacute; aon bhaile eile is.  Why are they going to be discriminated against?  They will be discriminated against.  They will be told that if they fail the test, they cannot reapply for a month.  The first thing the Minister should do is allow them, the minute they leave the test centre, or even before they leave it, to reapply for another date.  We should keep the spirit, the enthusiasm and the interest in being a good driver, qualified and law-abiding alive in them.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  I am after saying that a few times.  Praise the young and they will come along with us.  However, to insult and denigrate them, like the Minister is doing, is disgusting, as far as I am concerned.  His lack of engagement, empathy and any interest in helping them out, keeping them interested and active or getting them into the workforce is pathetic.<\/p> <p> The Minister refuses and refuses and refuses to answer.  As I said, I called on him before to explain the genesis of this legislation.  He can say he has met the Clancy family and many others - I have no doubt but that he has and I appreciate that - but we were here earlier tonight talking about the Bail (Amendment) Bill.  The Minister should talk to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  We talked about repeat offenders.  We saw Lucia O'Farrell here recently, thankfully.  We saw the countless repeat offences that the driver of that car had.  He was stopped at a checkpoint before killing Shane O'Farrell.  Why does the Minister not redouble with the Minister for Justice and Equality the traffic corps to what it was?  It is a help and an asset in areas where there is crime.  The Minister should get the traffic corps-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700053#FFF02000","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530121800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>On a point of order, we are on a specific amendment.

I resent being told I was acting the clown or whatever else.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, for the record I have statistics here that the Minister confirmed of the number of people waiting to be scheduled for driving tests.  I have said this is \"deeply alarming and a further indication of the disarray that is afflicting the learner driver system\".  Through the Chair, I beg the Minister that this is where he should focus his intention.  He should deal with the alarming figures I am going to quote and allow these people to get their tests.  If there is another problem out there that is not broken, he should not fix it.  He should fix the problem first.  Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.  This is deeply disturbing.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA has confirmed to me by parliamentary reply that nationally a total of 44,746 applications are waiting to be scheduled for tests.  These are the Minister's Department's figures.  They have no idea when they will get a date.  This is why I say the Minister should look at and deal with this first.  He has been in the job for two years.  The people in the RSA have criticised us.  This is what they should be dealing with.  Then they should deal with other issues systematically and incrementally along the way and try to have us all going in the one direction.  These figures go to the heart of what I and others have been saying for some time now, that there is chronic backlog afflicting this sector, which in turn is creating serious knock-on consequences.  That is where I am coming from.<\/p><p>That is where the problems are.<br\/><br\/>Going back to the employment market, we cannot get people.  We all know as business people we cannot get people because they cannot get their licences.  That would not be tolerated anywhere else.  They would be glad to get people back to work and they are needed now more than ever because we do not have people to do the work.  The Taoiseach tells us we have full employment.  We have negative situations in our county because we cannot get the staff because they cannot get their licences even though they are paying the money on training - I am sorry to be repetitive - to get the lessons and doing their best to get it but they cannot get the test.  The figures go to the heart of what I and others have been saying.<br\/><br\/>It is deeply alarming to me that the figure of 44,746 does not include those who have already been scheduled for an upcoming test.  Does the Minister understand?  It does not include the large cohort, I imagine, who have already been scheduled for a test and given a test date.  I do not have the numbers for that.  They have been scheduled for an upcoming test.  So the figure of almost 45,000 merely reflects those waiting to be given a test date.  There could be another 45,000 or 145,000: I do not know and the Minister will not tell us.  Has he asked his departmental officials?  Has he asked the RSA?  I know there are problems with getting information back and forth between the Garda and the RSA with one of them blaming the other and they cannot get accurate details to answer parliamentary questions which is ridiculous in a democracy.  They should be a public service and not self-serving.  They should tell the people the facts and not cloak it and mask it, trying to demonise young people.<br\/><br\/>The RSA advised that part of this is due to the number of driver tester retirements in the past 12 months.  However, hey presto, this week, either yesterday or the day before, I heard an RSA spokesperson say that once this law is passed - live horse and you will get grass - it will magically employ, I think, 160 extra testers.  I could be wrong on the figure.  The reply to the parliamentary question stated that part of it was due to the number of driver tester retirements in the past 12 months.  However, it does not specify how many testers have opted out of the system and why.  That is a very important question.  Have they taken early retirement?  Have they just got fed up with the system?  Have any of them been dismissed or reprimanded?  The Department will not answer that question either.  That is very important.<br\/><br\/>I am putting facts before the Minister.  They are the gospel as far as the RSA is concerned.  They are the Minister's words in a reply to a parliamentary question, which I have a right to ask.  The next thing some Deputies might try to stop rural Deputies having parliamentary questions.  They might have covered too much discrimination against rural areas.  That is what it is, dogged discrimination against rural areas.<br\/><br\/>The RSA has also advised that it has taken on 23 new testers since 2016.  This comes from the reply to a recent parliamentary question.  It could announce this week - dangle the carrot before us - that if we pass this Bill, it will appoint 160 new testers.  The reply stated that 23 testers had been recruited, but only six of those were due to have commenced by the end of 2017.  What is going on in the RSA and the testing?  Based on a parliamentary question submitted in late 2017 it had recruited 23 since 2016 but only six of the 23 will have commenced operating by this year.  This is simply not good enough given the scale of the challenge.  The Minister will not answer those questions either or ask officials to come in who answer to him.<br\/><br\/>We are being told the RSA will employ 160 of them - I could be wrong; it could be 140 or 150 of them - if the law is passed.  However, under existing legislation and existing massive waiting lists I have told the Minister about - I have requoted his figures back to him - he has told us the RSA has only recruited 23 testers since 2016 but only six of those had commenced operation by this year.  What are the other 17 doing?  I have no disrespect or animosity towards any of them.  They applied for the job.  I hope there was a rigorous process and they got the job.  Why are they not at work?  People are being driven to distraction, and driven into mental illness, unemployment and lack of engagement in our society and we have 17 driver testers, according to the Minister's figures, idle, ina su&iacute; gach l&aacute; in &aacute;it &eacute;igin, doing nothing.  As they say, the devil finds work for idle hands.  Why is that being done to those people?  They applied for the job, got the job and they are not being allowed to work and not being put at work.<br\/><br\/>There is something rotten in the RSA and in the Department with this kind of scandal going on.  I suspect they are getting paid.  Why should they not be paid if they are hired?  However, the Minister is not allowing them to work even though he has all those figures indicating that 44,747 people are awaiting a date for a driving test and that figure does not include those who have scheduled tests.<br\/><br\/>Why do people in Tipperary have to wait a month to reapply when with 17 testers recruited since 2016, n&iacute;l aon obair acu?  They have a job but they have no work.  This is a scandal that the Minister wrote about and railed about for decades in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>when he was writing about jobs for the boys, quangos and lack of accountability.  That rings fairly hollow now.  Does the Minister ever go back and look at some of the articles he wrote?  Seventeen testers have been recruited but not allowed to work.<br\/><br\/>I ask this question again.  Is there a trade union issue?  I asked that because I had been told in a nod-and-wink way that there was.  I do not know whether there is and I will not apportion blame.  There is some reason, which is rotten, that 17 people are getting paid with no work in spite of the fact that people are crying out to do their tests, crying out to get into the employment market and crying out to have social interactions and be able to fulfil their lives to some extent.  The Minister will not answer that question either.  I would like the Minister to write it down that 23 new testers were hired since 2016.  Based on the figures I have, quoted by the Minister, only six of them will have commenced operating by this year.  That is a scandal when we consider the number of people waiting for tests.  John in Tipperary today failed his test and must wait a month before he can even reapply.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has dangled the carrot in front of us - several carrots have been dangled - that if we pass the Bill, the RSA will recruit 150 of them.  When will they be put to work?  Will it be in 2040, given that it could only gainfully employ six of the 23 they took on trying to make some dent on the waiting lists?  If the Minister is worth a candle at all he should answer those questions before he penalises and discriminates further against the young men and women of rural Ireland and urban Ireland.  Most of the problems are in rural areas because people in urban areas have other forms of transport available to them which we do not have in rural Ireland.  Ba ch&oacute;ir don Aire an cheist sin a fhreagairt.  Before we go another minute he should be answering, but he has not answered any questions.<br\/><br\/>With all the amendments all the way along questions have been put to the Minister by several Deputies, not only from our side of the House, but also from the other side of the House, and he has not answered one.  He did not answer Deputy O'Keeffe's question.  He has not backed up his claim that repeat offenders are causing all the accidents.  That is a fine thing to say: it is nice and dandy.  It is a nice bit of a quote and will get traction in the media.  However, he is demonising innocent people if it is not true.  If he does not prove it to be true, it must be false.  We are not in a court of law here, but we are in an elected Parliament and we are getting this diatribe and lack of answers and lack of accountability.<br\/><br\/>In my county, Tipperary, 1,700 people are waiting for driving tests to be scheduled.  That does not include John, who did the test today, and the many others who have tests scheduled.  These are 1,700 people waiting to be scheduled for driving tests.  This demonstrates the enormity of the problem at a local level.  Does the Minister understand the 1,700 people?  I know he can count.  Those 1,700 people are waiting for driving tests to be scheduled in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  We can assume that 300 or 400 of those are young drivers who want to get on the road, want to play their part and want to be law abiding.  They will be criminalised if the Minister passes this legislation.  The objective is to make the roads safer, but this is criminalising young people.  It is naked and basic criminalisation and is demonising the people of Tipperary.  I will not stand for that.<br\/><br\/>The Minister came down to Cashel for a photo opportunity last week with his sop for the rural transport.<\/p><p>What about the young people?  What about the people who are waiting and who have no choice but to wait?  They will not even schedule them for a test.  What about those people?  It is time the Minister started being accountable.  It is time he started putting into action some of the words he wrote Sunday after Sunday.  Even during the holidays, when he was in France, he would write articles about how he would run the country and the world if he had a chance at power.  He is making a damn bad job of it.  He cannot run his Department.  He cannot control the RSA.  He cannot support the traffic corps or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and allow them to be out policing the roads and the uninsured drivers who are reckless, do not care, do not want a test, have no licence and are out there driving and causing mayhem and destruction.  That is where the Minister should focus his energy.<\/p> <p> The quiet, ordinary people of rural Ireland are a soft touch.  They are the people who will not come up here and march on the D&aacute;il about water charges.  They pay their way.  They dig their wells and pay their water charges.  They pay tax to educate their children and support their communities.  There is fundraising every day of the week.  There is fundraising when someone is sick or hurt in an accident, such as a young boy in Clogheen who was hurt on a mountain bike recently.  I attended a coffee morning last week that raised &euro;4,000 in a small community.  That is the generosity of spirit of the people the Minister is trying to blackguard.  It is downright naked blackguarding.  The Minister is looking up at the sky and anywhere except looking at me in the face to answer the questions I have asked him.  He has not answered even one question.  I have never seen such contempt for Members of the House by any Minister and I am here almost 11 years thanks to the good people of Tipperary.  I might not be here much longer but that is their decision.  While I am here I will try to hold the Minister to account because he is not accountable to anyone.  Just because he is holding the Government together it cannot do anything with him only throw sops every now and then.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, went to Stepaside last week to have a look at the Garda station to see if there were many inhabitants in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700054#GGG01900","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530123000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy addressing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1530123000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700056#JJJ00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1530123000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I might need to read it out to the Deputy to remind him of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700056#JJJ00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1530123000,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I have it here.

In spite of our pleas for engagement and for amendments to be accepted on Committee Stage, not only does the Minister delay but he recommits items.  This is one of them.  That is why we are still here ag c&aacute;int faoin mBille seo.  It is not my decision or the Acting Chairman's.<\/p><p>In Tipperary there are 1,700 people waiting to be scheduled for driving tests.  That is only one county.  Multiply that figure by 26.  They are the people who are waiting to be scheduled.  They are not the people who have been scheduled and are in the system and being worked along.  With so many testers we can assume there are probably at least 100 a week being tested.  I cannot get the figures.  What we are seeing here is that people simply cannot get a test within a reasonable period of time.  That is my issue.  They cannot get the test within a reasonable period of time.  They have done their best.  They have procured a vehicle and insurance at great expense and have procured driving instructors.  I salute them.  They are necessary, very good and professional.  They also have serious issues with the RSA, which will not listen.  It is cluasa d&uacute;nta.  People cannot even get a date for a test.  This is creating massive levels of frustration and uncertainty throughout the country and my county.  It must be addressed with all the other demands.<\/p><p>We can talk here <i>ad infinitum <\/i>and we still cannot get any questions answered.  This legislation will be forced through.  If the Government had the numbers it would guillotine it.  The Minister does not even listen.  He does not take account of the fact there have been 23 testers recruited and only six of them are at work.  C&aacute; bhfuil an 17 eile?  Cad at&aacute; siad ag d&eacute;anamh gach l&aacute;?  Where are they?  I am entitled to ask those questions and entitled to expect an answer and to be proven wrong if I am wrong.  The figures I am quoting are directly from a reply to a parliamentary question supplied to me by the Minister's Department.  It is my duty to insist we be told where these testers are.  It is also my duty to question the statement from the RSA or its agents this week which said they would recruit 150 or 160 new driving testers when the Bill is passed.  Live horse and you will get grass.  D&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i go raibh fear i dTiobraid &Aacute;rann a bhfuil p&oacute;ca ina l&eacute;ine aige.  The people are too educated for this now.  They will not buy this kind of claptrap and unaccountability.  They will not and have not bought it.  It is not acceptable.<\/p><p>The Minister will not answer any of the questions he has been asked.  There is one very serious one, which totally debunks any impression he might like to give that he is interested in road safety.  I will not say the Minister is not interested in road safety - I hope he is because I am - but he is not interested in sorting this out and having a level playing field, especially for young people or older learner drivers.  He will not give them a chance to fulfil their lives so they are not moping around, sad and despondent because they cannot get a test.  They have the lessons done and everything else.  The Minister will not answer those questions.  I am sorry I am being repetitive.<\/p><p>I will mention customer service in the NDLS again which is being delivered to motorists across the country, including young drivers.  It was foisted on us in Clonmel, on young people and learner drivers as well.  They could not find the place.  They could not get a time or a date.  They could not get good or bad from it.  In Arklow there is a portakabin and no ticket service like in the tax office.  Rows took place there.  It was foisted on us by the RSA with no proper consultation, imagination or checks and balances on how it would bed down.  I do not know how the Minister managed to keep a straight face when he indicated to me this was done to provide a more efficient and cost-effective service.<\/p><p>It is the same as the driving tests.  I am not commenting on the tests themselves but the whole system of getting a test.  How can the Minister quote that kind of diatribe that it is a more efficient and cost-effective service?  The reality is that three different companies were hired in to do what county council officials in the tax office did for decades.  They complied with the statutory instrument all those years ago when the then Minister announced people could buy a driver's licence over the counter because they could not deal with it.  Maybe the Minister should suggest some kind of an amnesty.  Would that be beyond his imagination or that of his Department?  Is there any imagination in there about how we could deal constructively with people who are waiting to do their tests?  We want them to be able to get on the road and to be legally on the road.  Maybe before using a mallet and a sledgehammer to crack a nut, the Minister will go back to the drawing board and use some bit of imagination to see how he will allow the 1,700 people in Tipperary to get a driving test.  How will he allow those young people, some of whom have just finished their leaving certificate exams and want to go on to do third level courses, or older people who have done courses get their tests?<\/p><p>We know the trouble.  Deputy Healy-Rae knows they were brought to Turas Nua.  Turas Uaf&aacute;sach I call it.  People are being driven here and there.  Maybe the Minister will allow the people in Turas Nua to get driving instruction free of charge or be assisted to get it from agencies.  The Abbey school in Tipperary town has a driving track.  It is lucky enough to have the space.  It hires in a good tester, Joe Quinn from Tipperary town, and he gives them lessons as part of the transition year project.  That is where we should be going with education.  We should have the test totally reformed.  We should take testing out of this chaotic system where 23 testers have been hired but only six are working.  I do not know if it is because there are union issues.Deputy Ross was the reforming Minister who was going to cut away the fat cats and the snouts from the troughs.  God knows what books he wrote.<\/p><p>I bought some of them but I am sorry I did.  They were a good read at the time and we expected things to be done but we know now whose snout is in the trough and we know whose ears are blocked to listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700056#JJJ01700","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530123600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>The Deputy should speak to the amendment please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700057#KKK00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1530123600,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I am.  I am asking that this be on the syllabus of the young people in transition year and maybe even before that, in third year.  The Minister should sit down with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and in the way special needs assistants are taken on special assistants should be taken on to encourage these young people to read and study the rules of the road and to understand the dangers of a mechanically propelled vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  People from the Road Safety Authority was in Clonmel recently to give an emergency services seminar.  It had a fine big road show and that was good.  There was a simulator car to show everyone, including young girls and boys, the impact of an accident and of a car overturning.  The Minister needs to get them trained to drive.  Rural drivers have some advantage over city drivers because many of them live on farms or have access to land where they can drive off road.  In cities they cannot.  Those people should be allowed to learn.  They want to learn.  There are no more imaginative young people than in our country.  Let them learn in school.  That might make school more interesting for some people, especially those doing the applied leaving certificate.  That is not too academic.  The Minister should get them tested and give them a prescriptive education not in a tutorial but where they could be brought along by the excellent teachers in our schools delivering those transition year programmes and have the simulators and the programme to understand the vehicle and its dangers, and to understand to respect the vehicle, the road users and themselves, when they get on the road.  That would be another imaginative way, and a compassionate way, of looking at the issue and it would make the transition year programmes much more interesting.  Some of them are very good, some not as good.  We have groups coming in here every day of the week from different counties.  They should be allowed to be enthused about this and to understand driving, whether it be a motorbike, a tractor or a gluaist&aacute;in - if the Minister does not know what a gluaist&aacute;in is, it is a car - and other vehicles as well.  That would be meaningful, productive and enlightening to all of us and would prove that the RSA and the Department and the two or three other quangos attached to it were interested, imaginative and were not a closed book or a closed shop that did not want to listen to, or engage with, the ordinary people, the 1,700 in Tipperary waiting for a date, multiplied by those in all the other counties.  It would show that they are interested in the real issues of road safety, not television promotions and advertisements.  They might get around to answering parliamentary questions we have put down, like those Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe has put down and many others who cannot get answers.  That would be one way to do it, a carrot and stick, mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh siad.  Train them when they are young.  That is necessary because the roads now are much more dangerous and faster.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the Nissan Leaf, an electric car, advertised as going from 0 to 60 km or 70 km in ten seconds.  The silence of that car is such that we will not even hear it coming.  That is technology and I welcome it but I got a spin in one and I know what it is like, I was a passenger.  We have to look at all the new technology.  Deputy O'Keeffe was in Germany looking at a driverless car.  He spoke about it and asked a few questions about it as well.  Maybe we are going to go that road.<\/p>  <p>  We need to keep pace and not have the old system of waiting to do the test, failing it and not being able to apply again for a month, and waiting again.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, could have given the whole national driver licence service, NDLS, to the post offices.  They are all over the place.  They are closing down and being bought out and forced out.  Where stands the Minister in that area?  He needs to be a bit imaginative.  He should use the staff.  I want to thank the local authority staff who dealt with the licences for young and old for decades in each county and did a good job.  It was unceremoniously taken away from them.  It was going to be better, faster, smarter and more efficient.  Tens of millions of euro later we end up with three companies trying to issue the licence now.  It is bedding in a bit now but we had disorganised and unprecedented chaos in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  Then there was the issue of the Government wanting to attach the personal public service number, PPSN, and national identity card to the driving licence.  It spent &euro;180 million on that before pulling the plug on it.  Fair dues to the Minister.  I salute him for doing that.  The plug had to be pulled after spending &euro;180 million.

On Deputy Fitzmaurice's suggested amendment, there is merit in the points he made about the length of waiting time for driving tests.  We all wish that driving tests were available in as short a time as possible.  I cannot support the Deputy's amendment, even though I think a valid point is being made.  It has to be dealt with separately.<\/p>  <p>  To take it to its logical conclusion, if this amendment was made it would mean that the protection intended by this section of the legislation would only apply for six weeks.  That flies in the face of what is intended.  The inquest into the deaths of Ms Geraldine Clancy and Ms Louise Clancy is where some of this amendment has come from - it is not exclusively from the Road Safety Authority.  It was a recommendation directly from that inquest.  I want to refer to a couple of other things before I finish.  I am not a fan of guillotines.  I was not a fan of them in the last D&aacute;il and we do not have them now because we have a Business Committee.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also a responsibility on us as parliamentarians to not abuse the situation.  We saw much repetition not addressing the issues in this Bill and that has been counterproductive.  What we have got to keep front and centre is that this is a road safety initiative.  The rights of young people must be taken into consideration in respect of the length of time they are waiting on the driving test list but Ms Louise Clancy was also a young person.  She cannot speak for herself.  I refer also to other families who had somebody killed in this scenario.  I would like to hear the Minister answering the questions.  The debate will keep going around in circles and unfortunately Standing Order 68, as has been called for by Deputy Broughan, terminates the debate.  It does exactly the opposite of what has been stated is the desired outcome that the answers will be facilitated.  That is the point that I was making.  I will also address this \"city slicker\" thing that I heard this evening.  I have lived in Kildare since 1978 and I am not a recent import to the area.  I resent that kind of personalised remark.

The Minister will have to be given an opportunity and if I accept this - and I may later Deputy Broughan - and guillotine it now, I am not going to take responsibility for that.  It is at my discretion.  I will be asking those who have offered to speak, to speak to the motion.<\/p><p>Unfortunately we are in a situation where this Bill has been recommitted.  All of the Members present understand what recommittal means.  We are not at Report Stage now but rather Committee Stage, and one can speak as often as one likes and as long as one likes, providing, of course, he or she focuses on the amendment.  We are now discussing the amendment tabled by Deputy Fitzmaurice.  Allow me to draw my breath and see how things develop from here.  The Members who are listed to speak are Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Michael Fitzmaurice and Michael Collins.  I will give those Members an opportunity to speak.  I will not stifle them, but I am asking that they take a limited amount of time.  If they do not I will revert back to the proposal suggested by Deputy Broughan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700058#LLL02700","speaker":"1289","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530124800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700059#MMM00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1530124800,"counter":581,"content":"<p>What is the point of order?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700059#MMM00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1530124800,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I am prepared to speak now in response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700059#MMM00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1530124800,"counter":583,"content":"<p>The Minister might be prepared to speak, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700059#MMM00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1530124800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I am prepared to speak if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle agrees to it.

I will then deal with Deputy Healy-Rae's questions.<\/p>  <p>  First, I thank Deputies who have made thoughtful contributions to the debate on this amendment.  I have already explained why I cannot accept Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice's proposed change to amendment No. 22, but I acknowledge the concerns which led him to propose it which were echoed by Deputy Catherine Murphy a few minutes ago.  In responding to Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice I also explained what was being done to reduce waiting times for driving tests.  I am happy to be able to provide an update on those measures and confirm that my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have approved the hiring on a phased basis of an additional 67 driving testers.  This will appreciably increase the capacity to reduce waiting times for tests.  I accept what Deputies Michael Fitzmaurice and Catherine Murphy and others have said about the waiting times.  They are far too long, but that does not mean that the amendment I am suggesting is wrong.  It is about saving lives.  The Road Safety Authority is taking measures to address the issue.  It may not be happening at a satisfactory speed, but to allow people who are not qualified on the road is not the solution.  The solution is to enable them to become qualified more quickly. <\/p>  <p>  On the test result, Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice suggested it was just a piece of paper, that the person was just as good a driver two days before the test as he or she was two days afterwards.  I am sure that is true.  Moreover, if a person is a bad driver two days before the driving test, he or she remains a bad driver two days after he or she fails it.  The point is we cannot know until after a person takes the driving test.  Would Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice get on a aeroplane if he was told that the pilot was not qualified but would take the test in two days?  Would he go undergo surgery if he was told the surgeon was not qualified but would be soon?  We cannot take this risk with people's lives, which is why we require a learner driver to be accompanied by a qualified driver.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said I was making an assumption that an accident involving an unaccompanied driver would not have happened if he or she had been accompanied by a qualified driver.  I am not making assumptions.  The tragic fact is that of 24 learner drivers killed on the roads during 2016 and 2017, 20 had been unaccompanied.  That is proof, if anyone needs it, that unaccompanied learner drivers are a danger to themselves, to say nothing about being a danger to other road users.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Thomas P. Broughan made a good suggestion.  I am happy to be able to tell him that the RSA is working to that end.  Action 8 in the mid-term evaluation of the road safety strategy requires it to, \"Develop a business case to support the inclusion of compulsory road safety education in the curriculum for secondary schools\".  It is working towards this goal, which has a target completion date of the fourth quarter of 2018.  The RSA is developing the business case.  It will assess whether there is international evidence to support the measure and, if there is such, whether it demonstrates effectiveness in changing attitudes and behaviours towards road safety.  The RSA will prepare and present the business case to the Department of Education and Skills for its consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA has two road safety programmes available for teachers to be delivered in secondary schools.  The Streetwise resource is aimed at those in junior cycle, while \"Your road to safety\" is targeted at transition year students.  The RSA is updating the transition year programme which it will launch in September in the new virtual learning environment.  In addition, it offers a three-year road safety course, Road Safety Matters, which is available for implementation.  To complement these teacher-led resources, the RSA's national road safety education service staff visit secondary schools to deliver road safety education to students.  It also has an interactive mobile education unit with a roll-over simulator, the Shuttle, targeted at secondary schools during the academic year.<\/p><p>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae asked me to use my power to ensure local authorities cut hedges.  I appreciate the Deputy's faith in ministerial powers but I am afraid I do not actually have the power to tell local authorities what to do.  Perhaps if the hedges in Kerry need trimming he might know someone with influence in Kerry County Council.<\/p> <p> Deputy Broughan, whose support for the Bill and the amendment are very much appreciated, raised the issue of consolidation of the Road Traffic Acts and I agree with him.  This legislation goes back to 1961.  It has been amended numerous times and is in need of consolidation.  However, this does not infer that the legislation is in some way faulty or that cases are being lost due to the absence of consolidation.  The difficulty is that it is not simply a matter of restating all of the road traffic legislation currently in force in one Bill.  We would need to examine each aspect of the Road Traffic Acts to see whether it is in need of updating.  If we did not do so, we would soon find ourselves amending our consolidated Act in a whole host of ways and we would very quickly be back where we started with annual Bills to update the legislation.<\/p> <p> A fair estimate, and I agree there is a need for this, would be that to do the project properly would take three years.  Deputy Broughan suggested the Law Reform Commission, LRC, could take on the project.  That is certainly a possibility.  I point out that the LRC undertakes projects either on the basis of multi-annual programmes, which must be approved by the Government, or at the request of the Attorney General.  As the LRC is currently engaged in a work programme, the most obvious route to asking it to consider consolidation of the Road Traffic Acts would be through a request of the Attorney General.  If this route were to be considered it would probably mean shelving other work planned or under way at the LRC.<\/p> <p> Deputy Catherine Murphy probably restricted her contribution in the interests of facilitating the early passage of the Bill.  I hope her wishes will be adhered to.  Her point was that we must separate two issues here, one being the shortage of driver testers and the other being the issue of learner drivers on the road unaccompanied, to which I am determined to put an end.<\/p> <p> What I propose in amendment No. 22 is a logical step to improving enforcement of the law against unaccompanied learner drivers.  I know this would cause hardship, but unaccompanied learner drivers are breaking the law and are a danger if they are driving unqualified.  We have to put an end to the scourge of road deaths.  The Deputies in the corner will be aware that, very sadly, the number of road deaths has increased this year.  It is up by two compared with this day last year.  I am sure the Deputies share our enthusiasm, energy and determination to keep the number of road deaths down, and we are absolutely determined to get the figure down.  If this involves hardship for some people, such as learners who drive unaccompanied or those who have had too much to drink, I am sorry but it is a price they will have to pay to save other people's lives.  What I propose in amendment No. 22 is this logical step to improving enforcement of the law against these people.  It would allow garda&iacute; to detain a vehicle driven by an unaccompanied learner driver, as they can already detain a vehicle where there is no tax, insurance or national car test certificate, or where they have reason to believe the driver is too young to have even a learner permit or is disqualified.  It will provide a very valuable tool to garda&iacute; in dealing with unaccompanied learner drivers.  The very fact it has aroused such passionate opposition from some is a testament to what a significant deterrent it may be.<\/p> <p> I want to respond to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's questions.  His first question was about people being left by the side of the road in County Kerry.  Garda&iacute; already detain vehicles with no NCT, tax or insurance.  They do not abandon people by the roadside in those cases and they will not do so in this case.  He said people should get one chance.  I could be sympathetic with this in certain cases, but I could not possibly be sympathetic with it in the case of people being in charge of a lethal weapon which they are not qualified to drive.  We cannot give people one chance to cause collisions or fatal accidents when they are not qualified to drive.  What we do is give them a driving test.  This amendment tackles the problem.  It addresses the problem and put a finger on it.  I do not for one moment dispute that.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is right, but he is absolutely wrong about the solution.  His suggestion would not be solution.  If we were to do what he proposes, there would almost certainly be more and not fewer road deaths, and I do not think anybody disputes that.<\/p> <p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae also asked whether garda&iacute; do not have enough to do without addressing this.  He is right; garda&iacute; are overextended and enforcement is a problem.  We have put our finger on this problem time and again.  We need more garda&iacute;, but they are coming.  This problem is being addressed.  We also need good laws.  The solution to difficulties with enforcing all of our laws is to provide more garda&iacute; and not for one moment to allow bad laws to continue to exist.  To answer the Deputy's question as to when the Bill will be passed, I hope it will be passed very soon and I appeal to him and everybody else to facilitate its passage because it will save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700060#NNN01300","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530126000,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I have one more question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700061#OOO00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1530126000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>Hold on.

They are unqualified not just because they may not be in control of their speed but for all sorts of different reasons.  They need more than to go slowly to be qualified to drive.

I have not got answers to some of them, although I accept the Minister has addressed others.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to waiting times for driving tests, the worst wait in Ireland is in Cork, which is 17.4 weeks.  How can the Minister consider in any way, shape or form that this part of the Bill was rural-proofed?  It is misleading the D&aacute;il.  There are young people in County Cork waiting 17.4 weeks for a test, which is an outrageous length.  Why has the Minister not tackled that matter, which would be part of the process of rural-proofing the Bill?  He should tackle this before the Bill becomes law and he has failed to do it so far.  Will the Minister tell us why he has not tackled this?  The question is in his lap as the people of Cork are waiting for a driving test for 17.4 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Government started to educate younger people through the school system?  It is very important and the matter has been raised by others.  We must start at the roots and get to young people.  It would be an absolute joy for them to learn how to drive.  There are places like the Bantry Driving Academy, which is a fabulous place where young people can learn to drive.  Have there been efforts to ensure such learning can occur?<\/p>  <p>  I asked the next question at a very early stage.  The Minister said he is delighted certain people have been appointed to the board of the RSA, which is an important point.  How were they appointed and what input does the Minister have in the process?  The Minister said those people should be on the board but there are others who have lost people in road traffic accidents who perhaps should be appointed to the board of the RSA as well.  They would have input into the conditions of our roads, which are appalling in most cases, falling trees and other factors that lead to loss of life.<\/p>  <p>  The next issue might move slightly away from the amendment.  There are Irish people who have returned from America who despite having a full licence there must do a theory test and learn how to drive in Ireland.  Has the Minister addressed this and the matter of young people abroad who are now coming home?  Licences which were valid in places like Australia are not considered valid here.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will have a very damaging effect in rural Ireland but how has the Minister addressed this for young people?  With the drink-driving aspect of the Bill, the Minister at least made a poor attempt to set up a rural transport service.  There are young people who will not be able to go to work in the morning or come home in the evening, which are basic journeys.  How has the Minister addressed this when he \"rural-proofed\" the Bill?  If he has a solution, it would be proof that the Minister is making an effort.  People living in rural areas have little or no bus service so does the Minister intend to set up bus services to take young people to work or college in the morning and bring them home in the evening?  Will the Minister answer that question?<\/p>  <p>  Is it the Minister's intention with this Bill to jail parents who allow young people to drive cars unaccompanied by qualified drivers?  I am trying to go through my questions as fast as I can.  The Minister addressed the speed limiter a while ago but why has he not gone down that road with young people?  Perhaps there could be an overnight curfew for them.  It might ease in this process rather than land these people in a difficult position, basically putting young people off the road, making life much more difficult.  This will affect people in rural Ireland as well as urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister accept the lack of funding for roads has been a cause of death?  I have mentioned roads west of Ross Carbery, in Sparrograda and Ballydehob: there is a list a mile long with roads that are in an appalling condition.  Does the Minister accept that falling trees have been a cause of death and what has he done to alleviate the problem?  These are just some questions and I would greatly appreciate him answering them.  Will he ask the councils for a realistic estimate of costs to put the roads right, as the condition of our roads are leading to most road deaths?  Nobody is speaking about that, least of all the Minister, and they should be doing so.  The Minister has said it is the business of local authorities to cut road verges etc.  I accept that they are in charge to a point, but the Minister must provide the funding.<\/p><p>There is no point in the Minister sarcastically saying to us it is a matter for the local authority and that he is washing his hands of it.

Deputy Collins said the situation in Cork is worse than anywhere in the country with a waiting time of 17.4 weeks.  It is not.  There are worse, although I hate to tell Deputy Collins that.  I am unsure where Deputy Collins got his figures from but there are worse figures.  They are bad.  A waiting period of 17.4 weeks is bad.  Deputy Collins is correct about that, but there are worse figures.  Wexford has worse figures.  Donegal has worse figures.  I regret that, but the average wait is somewhere around 17 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I have gone into considerable detail about what the Road Safety Authority is doing in my replies on this stage and on the previous stage as well.  The effort is being made to accelerate this.  The problem is being addressed aggressively by the RSA in the ways I have already spelt out.  Deputy Collins should not say that nothing is being done.  Enough is not being done.  We want to bring the waiting time down well into single figures.  That would be adequate.  I accept the problem, but we are addressing it and the RSA is addressing it.  We acknowledge the problem but, as I have said previously, the driver testing problem should not be mixed up with allowing people to go on the roads.  We do not solve the problem by allowing people to break the law.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the issue of young people and education.  I have already addressed that.  There are already road safety programmes in schools.  They are run and promoted by the RSA.  That is being addressed.  I answered that question some minutes ago.<\/p>  <p>  How are directors appointed?  I will explain how they are appointed.  It is a new system that leaves me with virtually no discretion whatsoever, and deliberately so. In his Second Stage speech, the Deputy implied that I had done something. The idea is that I cannot make political decisions in appointing people to semi-state bodies.  What happened in this case was that we searched for people who had experience of road accidents, who were representatives of road victims or who had authority and credibility to speak about road tragedies and road safety because they had suffered.  The Deputy should not come back to me and say that I am lying if I am wrong, but I believe we got 60 applications when the process was advertised.  The figure is around that anyway - if it is 61 or 62, Deputies should not nail me to the cross on it.  The applications came in.  They went through a process of being selected by panel.  It was all done by the Public Appointments Service and not by me.  Then, those who fulfilled the criteria were selected for interview and they were interviewed.  Four names came up to me and I selected the top two, as I have done in every case.  I did not interfere in any way.  That is how it was done.  There were interviews, which is rather revolutionary and radical in the appointment of people to state bodies.  All I did was select the top two who were appointed as a result of the interview.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Collins addressed the issue of the rural Local Link.  I think this will work. The welcome I got in Kerry for it was staggering.  I am grateful for the fact that both Deputies Healy-Rae greeted me and welcomed me to Kerry last Friday.  The spontaneous welcome I got from people there for the link buses was reassuring.  I know that people have said the funding is only &euro;450,000, but that is a great deal of money by any standards.<\/p>  <p>  This is being done as a pilot scheme.  It is my intention to pursue this if it works, and it looks to me as if it will work.  There is considerable pent-up demand because of the issue all the Deputies have identified.  There is rural and social isolation.  There is a problem in rural Ireland with this.  We must identify exactly where it is and how it can be resolved.  To denigrate a scheme that is in place to help to address this problem, albeit in a preliminary way, is probably unhelpful.  It is my intention, if I remain Minister, that this scheme will be expanded.  It will be tailored and changed.  That is why it is a pilot scheme.  We are going to attack rural isolation with this as a beginning. I appeal to Deputies to give it a chance.  It is a good idea.  There is pent-up demand.  There is no doubt whatsoever about that.  What I saw when I travelled on one of those buses on Friday was hope for the future.  People from Kerry said to me that it is a good scheme. These people are probably great supporters of the Healy-Rae brothers and that is not incompatible.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Collins asked whether I would send parents to jail.  No, the fine is only &euro;1,000.  There is no intention of jailing anyone.  We are not looking for parents.  That is not fair; it is being emotional.  We intend to stop people lending their cars to unaccompanied drivers.  What we intend to do is to ensure that unaccompanied drivers who are driving without permits are stopped from doing so - that is all.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about trees.  That is a local authority matter.

What are we to do with that same young fellow who, from that date, cannot apply for a retest until one month passes?  What kind of rule is that?  What are we going to do about those situations?<\/p>  <p>  Why do we not have enough testers?  Is there trouble with the unions?  Are we being held over a barrel such that we cannot employ more testers?  Surely there are people who are qualified and who could do the testing?  Why can we not hire them?  It is not fair to be holding up these people in this way.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the Local Link.  The Minister announced eight routes in Kerry.  One of them was agreed before the Minister ever dreamt up the idea.  Route number 3 runs from Castlegregory to Cloghane.  A car came on Tuesdays once a month for ten months.  How is that going to help people who cannot get from A to B?  Will the Minister expand the rural Local Link so that we can help young drivers who are waiting for their tests?  That is an issue that I support and want addressed as well.  We barely have enough school buses to take the children to school.  Routes are being cut.  Where fewer than ten children travel, the route is squashed.  It is simply a way of getting out and saving money.  Where is the Minister getting the money?  Is it from the Leprechaun?  Bus &Eacute;ireann does not seem to have the money for the school run.<\/p><p>Where will this money come from?<\/p> <p> It is not too late for him to do more assessments of what he is doing.  I ask him to return to his plan and to live in a rural place in Kerry for at least a week without a car to see how he would manage.  He might have his thumb up on the road with nothing passing.  Maybe some fellow might know him but he would not stop for him because of what the Minister is trying to do to us.

According to the Road Safety Authority the longest waiting time for a driver test recorded in the Tralee centre is 27 weeks while in Killarney it is 26 weeks.  I am fairly sure that I can stand up for our local radio station, Radio Kerry.  The Minister can look up its website,<i>www.radiokerry.ie, <\/i>and see that that is where I got those statistics.  Those statistics would not be there unless they were factual and verifiable.  The Minister said that extra driver testers will be appointed and that he is allowing for 67 extra testers to be put in place.  How many new testers does he propose to give us in County Kerry to deal with the figures that I have outlined?  I deal daily with the young people who the Minister is hurting with what he is proposing.  They are telling me that it is extremely unfair to get their full licence in order that they can get on in life, they are being told that they must wait.  If the Minister and those supporting him get their way, they will tie those people down at home, stopping them from working and from furthering their education.  However, the Minister has not said what he will put in place for them.<\/p><p>The one thing that those people deserve to hear tonight is precisely what the Minister will do for the people in County Kerry in relation to more funding, support and testers.  He should have that done before bringing in this legislation.  What Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice said to the Minister earlier was very fair.  If it is what he is proposing, he should do it before railroading the legislation through.
