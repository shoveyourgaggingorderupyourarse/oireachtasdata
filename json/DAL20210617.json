It is estimated that by the end of June 2021, the sector will have received approximately &euro;300 million in such supports.

The most recent extension, made last month, ensures that no vehicle will be forced to exit the fleet due to age limits alone in 2021.  I trust the authority will keep this issue under review as society and the economy reopen and passenger demand returns.<\/p>  <p>  The authority's extension of age limits is an emergency measure, taken in recognition of the particular challenges occasioned by Covid-19.  The ten-year rule was recommended by the 2011 taxi regulation review and came about following a public consultation on vehicle standards for taxis, hackneys and limousines held that year.  It was adopted in recognition of the need to strike a balance between achieving standards that offer the customer confidence, comfort and safety and allowing industry members to operate successfully, cognisant that the replacement of a vehicle is a SPSV operator's single largest cost.<\/p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the fleet towards zero-carbon, low-emission vehicles.

I am not just talking about rail but also the wider context.  It is important that we take a multi-modal approach to transport planning and the provision and integration of public transport services and infrastructure.  That approach is evident in the statutory transport strategy for the wider greater Dublin area, which includes south Wicklow and which the National Transport Authority is required to prepare under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  The Act requires the NTA to develop a 20-year multi-modal strategy and requires it to review and update the strategy every six years to take account of developments and revise the strategy as needed.  The current strategy sets out a range of proposed interventions required across all modes and progress is under way on a number of those interventions.  These include the DART+, which will provide enhanced capacity as far as Greystones but could provide associated benefits as far south as Wicklow, and the N11 bus priority project, which will seek to enhance bus priority along this route and enhance the attractiveness of the bus as an option for south Wicklow commuters.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically looking at rail, aspects of the Wicklow rail line are challenging and potentially susceptible to coastal erosion.  That is why my Department, through the NTA, is funding a programme of works over the coming years to protect the existing railway line from coastal flooding and coastal erosion and improve the reliability and availability of the existing rail services across County Wicklow.  In addition to the above, there are two reviews under way which are of relevance to potential further improvements to rail in the county.  The first is the ongoing review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, which is under way with a draft strategy to be published by the NTA later in the year for public consultation.  The second is a strategic rail review, which my Department is leading on and which will look at inter-urban and inter-regional rail and will be of relevance to south Wicklow, given the intercity services that operate on the line. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700005#C00700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1623917700,"counter":31,"content":"<p>What I am hearing is that there are a lot more plans for south County Wicklow.

The DART will be fully electrified on certain services, such as the one to Maynooth, with overhead power lines and so on.  There may well also be a possibility of running battery electric trains, which can avail of that power supply and then run on a battery system if they go beyond the grid network.  This technology is still evolving and the types of trains that would operate on a service running as far south as Wicklow or Arklow are only at an early stage of development but it is something at which we are looking.

The NTA has already held the first public consultation as part of the review, with the publication late last year of an issues paper.  I know that as part of that initial consultation process, people made their views known about a possible rail line to Navan and no doubt the Deputy contributed to that process.  As part of its overall review, the NTA has engaged external expertise to specifically re-examine the feasibility of a Navan rail line and this specific assessment will be an input into the overall review.  This assessment will be a factual report, detailing the feasibility of the project by addressing its need and its alignment with national, regional and local policy, establishing its benefits and providing a comprehensive economic and financial assessment of the project in accordance with the requirements of the public spending code.<\/p>  <p>  The next step in the process is a second round of public consultation on a draft revised strategy and I am informed that this public consultation will take place in early autumn.  As part of the consultation process, all background reports, such as the one being prepared for the Navan rail line, will be published in full, allowing for detailed review by all interested parties and assisting with developing their feedback.  It is expected that a revised strategy will be ready by mid-2022.  I would note of course that delivery of projects and programmes under any revised strategy over the medium term will be determined by the allocations we receive as part of the ongoing national development plan, NDP, review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700006#D00500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1623918300,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Last night, my party and almost all of the Opposition supported the climate Bill.

It is important to say at the outset that my approach to this review has been based around the sort of outcomes I want to see this NDP deliver.  I would like it to set the groundwork for a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland, as committed to in the programme for Government.  We want to see the NDP support the investment needed to support the national planning framework, particularly in terms of supporting balanced regional development and compact growth in the five cities.  This NDP needs to set us on our way to reducing emissions in line with our 2030 and 2050 net zero commitments.  Our ability to deliver on those outcomes will be determined by the allocations we receive as part of the review, but my approach to the review has been framed by these considerations.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy knows I believe in the potential of rail infrastructure and services.  I am of the view that this potential is not currently realised and that we can do better.  That is why I broadened the terms of reference of what was a proposed high-speed study between Belfast, Dublin and Cork, so that it is now an all-island strategic rail review.  This review will be conducted in co-operation with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive and will examine all aspects of interurban and inter-regional rail.  It will set the type of strategic backdrop to rail investment in our regions and on our mainline network that the recent Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions, JASPERS, review of the western rail corridor noted was lacking.<\/p> <p>We need this type of strategic analysis to inform our consideration of specific projects and I very much look forward to its completion next year and implementing its recommendations in the coming years, supported by the new national development plan.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, a number of projects already under way will continue to be supported.  These include the redevelopment of Ceannt Station in Galway, a new platform at Oranmore and improved protection and renewal of the network across the region generally, thanks to the increased allocations under the infrastructure manager multi-annual contract programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700006#D01500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623918900,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.

This project scores very highly in that regard.  Cost certainty is absolutely huge because the big variables are taken out of this as it is an existing railway line and we have the alignment.  The project scores very highly with regard to emissions.  Would it ease the Minister's problems somewhat if we were to seek funding in the west from the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, to co-fund this project and potentially look for CL&Aacute;R funding as most of the railway line is in the CL&Aacute;R area?  If this were to be made available to reduce the net cost to the Department, would it ease the challenge for the Minister in getting this no-brainer project off the ground at last?

I have nothing against the road in question, but it almost goes as far as Ballyvourney.  Its cost is coming in at approximately &euro;250 million.

This relatively small number is a prudent step as we see what the health impact might be.  I understand that, to date, the RSA has offered test bookings to over 2,500 candidates.  Essential workers continue to be the priority.  The reopening of essential driver training for this category means that more essential workers coming through the system will be looking for tests.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to meet the growing demand for tests.  The RSA has a complement of 100 permanent driver testers.  An additional 40 temporary driver testers have been authorised, along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020.  The additional testers are expected to start testing by the end of June.  In addition, sanction is now being sought to add a further 40 testers to that cohort.  We are going from 100 testers to approximately 220.  The RSA is also seeking to increase the number of tests from six to seven per tester per day, as well as extending operating hours when restrictions are fully lifted.<\/p>  <p>  The first 40 new testers are in training and the capacity of the service is just over 3,000 tests per week.  While training is under way capacity per week is slightly reduced as testers who would otherwise be testing are involved in training new recruits.  Assuming a successful return to seven tests per tester per day and with the 40 testers already approved, the capacity of the system will be 4,881 tests per week.  If we are still at six tests per tester when the 40 testers begin, that figure will be 4,183.  At this point, there are approximately 72,000 people eligible to take a test.  With 4,881 tests weekly, it should be possible to clear that backlog in 15 weeks, allowing for those testers doing seven tests per day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700008#F00900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1623919500,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I commend the efforts to keep the service going as much as possible during the pandemic at the times when it was possible to operate.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport or in decisions on fares.<\/p>  <p>  Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority in December 2009, the NTA has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation, PSO, contracts.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 crisis has had a profound impact on the public transport sector and the travelling public.  The introduction of restrictions on public movement and the temporary closure of many workplaces, education centres and leisure and social activities across the country has led to an unprecedented fall in demand for public transport, with passengers falling to below 10% of 2019 levels at the height of the restrictions.  As a result, many TaxSaver holders were not in a position to use their tickets.<\/p>  <p>  As part of a suite of measures introduced in 2020 to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including increased PSO subvention and the introduction of temporary supports for the commercial bus sector, Government approval was given to the NTA last year to extend the TaxSaver annual tickets that existed at that time, for a further six months, in response to the Covid-19 public health emergency.<\/p>  <p>  This extension facilitated many customers who had been taking infrequent trips since March 2019.  In parallel to the extension, all subsidised operators continued to offer refunds to those customers who chose to seek a refund and many have done so.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA informed me recently that it is not in a position to offer a further extension of the TaxSaver annual tickets.  For those passengers who will be travelling less frequently than before, there remains a range of discounted fares and tickets available through the Leap card, including Leap capping, both weekly and daily, Rambler tickets for bus services in Dublin, Irish Rail web fares and other discounted products.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the possible introduction of a possible part-time TaxSaver commuter ticket following the Covid pandemic, the NTA is currently evaluating such a proposal and my Department recently commenced discussions with the NTA and the Department of Finance in order to obtain approval for the implementation of a more flexible TaxSaver product.  The NTA is proceeding with the detailed technical work associated with such a proposal, while discussions with the Department of Finance continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700009#G00900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1623920100,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Many of those commuters have continued working from home to date in 2021 and have not availed of the six-month extension.<\/p>  <p>  I know of one person, for example, who paid for a full 2020 ticket, availed of the extension when it was offered last August clearly not expecting that lockdown would go on for so long and has yet to work in the office in 2021.  If people return following public health guidance, they could be paying the cost of an 18-month commuter ticket while not even using it for that period.  Current advice is still to work from home.

I propose to take question Nos. 13, 64, 98 and 197 together.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to set out the broad framework of horizontal support measures the Government has made available to the taxi industry in response to this pandemic.  The industry has been badly affected by Covid-19.  Passenger demand for services has dropped and many small public service vehicle, SPSV, operators simply have not worked since the start of the pandemic.  I understand as many as 70% of SPSV drivers have availed of the PUP, which, as the Deputy will be aware, has been extended to February 2022.  Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given eight-week period, net of expenses.  As society begins to reopen and passenger demand for taxis increases, this will become an increasingly important support for drivers as they return to work.  Drivers coming off the PUP can avail of the Covid-19 enterprise support scheme, worth up to &euro;1,000 to meet the costs associated with returning to work.  That is the context in which my Department has funded additional measures targeted at the SPSV sector.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the major costs associated with operating a taxi, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity.  Following consultation with the advisory committee, measures are being developed to target those statutory costs that cannot be deferred.  Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and I can confirm that they will be waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million.  Furthermore, I have allocated &euro;3.5 million towards the refund of national car test, NCT, test fees and motor tax for SPSV operators for a 12-month period, the commencement date for which has yet to be decided.  The NTA will administer these refund schemes and further details, including how to apply, should be available during the third quarter of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator.  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700011#J00700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1623921300,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Taxi drivers must be able to plan for the next three, four or five years in order to recover from this.  The moratorium on taxi licences is another ask they had which would have zero cost to the State.  They also want a guarantee of the continued use of quality bus corridors, which I believe is something the Minister has verbally supported them on.  They also want reform or disbandment of the Taxi Advisory Council.  I am in favour of reform such that the council works more effectively.<\/p>  <p>  On the PUP, it must be remembered that there are a number of taxi drivers who are older and thus not entitled to the payment.

I absolutely recognise that that does not apply to people above a certain age limit but unfortunately for the Department of Social Protection, it could not go to the step of having different age limits for different sectors availing of the PUP.<\/p>  <p>  On another of the Deputy's points, it is slightly infuriating that people are out there saying taxis will be banned from the bus corridors.  They are just scaring people, stirring up trouble but not actually telling the truth.  That was never announced, never planned and never considered.

Taxi drivers have still had to pay out of their own pockets to install glass screens, acquire PPE and apply other protective measures to their vehicles.  They need supports to recover from that.  It almost goes unsaid but there must be a shift in how they are treated and respected by all.  They are a vital service in the context of our transport system.  Taxi drivers have been out there delivering people to vaccine appointments, testing appointments and doing an awful lot of unheralded work out of their own pockets in an unsafe and scary time.

The number of Covid cases continues to come down.  In that context, I expect the taxi industry to start to see a return.  Some areas like international business travel are not going to come back immediately and it is going to take time but there are taxis taking people to and from the airport, for example.

Following the establishment of the NTA in 2009, the authority has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under PSO contracts.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for setting passenger fares relating to its commercial Expressway bus services.  The NTA does not have a role in the setting of fares for services provided by commercial operators, including Bus &Eacute;ireann.  As a result, fares charged to passengers on Expressway and PSO services are set independently of each other.<\/p>  <p>  Over a number of years, the NTA's approach to fare regulation has been to gradually simplify the fare structures across bus, rail and light rail services and to increasingly move towards a fairer, distance-based structure.  The NTA points out in its more recent fares determinations, that fares are adjusted both upwards and downwards, ensuring the travelling public pays a fare relative to the distance they travel, such that the operators are in a position to provide a safe and reliable service.  For 2020, the NTA set fares by way of two determinations.  The first determination made adjustments for all monthly and annual tickets, including tax saver tickets, with an implementation date of 1 December 2019.  The second fares determination addressed adjustments for all other fares with changes effective from April 2020.  These determinations have further progressed the NTA's fares policy objectives.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the point that we must go further and do more because there are anomalies right across the country that are regularly brought to my attention.  In some cases, the fare suddenly jumps up once a person travels outside a certain zone and it is not done on the basis of distance.  I will talk to the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann and see what we can do to progress that simple mechanism whereby there is a correlation between distance and fare structures, so we do not have these anomalies where fares suddenly jump once people go beyond a certain boundary limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700011#J01400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1623921900,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the response but I am not sure it quite gets to the heart of the question.

The same journey from Dungarvan to Waterford on the Expressway route costs &euro;5.  This type of pricing inconsistency, for the people standing at the bus stop waiting for the next service, creates ill feeling and confusion.  It puts people off using public transport and also creates difficulty for drivers.  While they might be two arms of the same company, it is the same drivers who are operating on these routes and, in one instance, they are being asked to charge &euro;13.50 and, in the other, &euro;5.

In that regard, there is a lot of work to be done in standardising fares, standardising the booking system and making it easier to book online, given there are all sorts of different anomalies which do not facilitate easy encouragement of passengers.<\/p>  <p>  The example given by the Deputy is a good one.

The overall level of capital expenditure in 2021 stands at &euro;10.1 billion, or almost &euro;11 billion when capital carryover from last year is included.  This allocation is almost &euro;5.5 billion, or 119%, higher than the amount allocated in 2017.  In other words, capital allocations have already more than doubled under the national development plan.  This is an all-time high in the history of the Irish State, with a commitment to maintaining and further increasing this over the lifetime of this Government.  This is in spite of the major challenges facing the Exchequer due to the impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit.

Of this, almost &euro;2 billion in capital was committed to the delivery of housing in 2021.

In addition, phase 1 of the NDP review examined the question of what the appropriate level of capital expenditure should be.  As part of that, a macroeconomic analysis considered a number of factors including: the overall fiscal position; the demand for investment; the supply side capacity constraints in the public sector and construction sector; and international comparisons.

The Government has to take the whole picture into account and make decisions that reflect our commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare and investing in climate action and transport.

A key focus of the review of the national development plan, NDP, is on the capability and capacity of the public service to deliver the ambitious targets for investment that are set out in the plan.  Building on recent reforms such as the update of the public spending code, this Government has initiated a suite of reforms to strengthen the assurance arrangements and public sector capability to deliver the NDP.  The phase 1 report of the NDP review published by my Department in April includes an analysis of public sector capacity constraints in investment delivery.  The analysis notes that even when functioning at maximum efficiency, the public sector has the capacity to deliver a limited amount of investment in any given year regardless of how much funding is made available.  All investment typically requires administration, appraisal, planning, design, procurement, etc.  All of these processes take time and expertise.  Delivery capacity is relatively fixed in the short term, which naturally limits the ability to ramp up public investment in the short term.<\/p>  <p>  It is possible to develop and step-up the capacity of the public sector over the medium term through reallocation of resources, training, upskilling, knowledge-sharing and recruitment of additional staff and expertise to build delivery capacity.  That is where my focus will be in the review of the national development plan.  Money is not always the key constraint.  It is the ability to get things done and to deliver projects through what can be a cumbersome and slow progress.  We are bringing in a range of reforms.  A range of measures are in train to increase public sector delivery capacity over the medium term, including the establishment of a commercial skills academy, the public infrastructure network, the expansion of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, an EU-funded independent report on the capacity of the public sector to deliver capital projects, and a range of reforms of planning, including the establishment of a new planning and environmental court.

I acknowledge the work that he and others have done in assisting patients in his constituency to avail of the services of the cross-border directive.  While the policy matter is one for the Minister for Health, I am happy to answer the question as best I can.<\/p>  <p>  Since the start of this year, the provisions of the EU cross-border directive no longer apply to the UK.  On 28 December 2020, the Government approved the implementation of a new Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme.  The new scheme, operational from 1 January 2021, enables persons resident in the State to access the same treatments previously provided for under the EU cross-border directive and be reimbursed for such private healthcare in Northern Ireland by the HSE, provided such healthcare is publicly available within Ireland.  It is intended that the scheme will operate for 12 months on an administrative basis initially, with a view to developing a general scheme to provide a statutory basis for the scheme.  The Minister for Health is progressing plans in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is demand led.  The cross-border directive costs have been increasing year on year and in 2020 were &euro;15.4 million.  The bigger picture here is that we need to get away from people needing to travel to Northern Ireland.  That is the bottom line.  We are investing &euro;22 billion this year in our public health service.  We should be able to provide the service for cataract treatment, for example.  In that regard many of the constituents that the Deputy is assisting to bring to Northern Ireland will be able to benefit from the additional investment which is now being provided in ophthalmology services.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a reconfiguration is under way in Cork, involving the existing services amalgamated from two sites at Cork University Hospital and the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital to now be based on the South Infirmary campus.  It includes a new outpatient building, which is nearing completion.  Following its completion, services will transfer to the South Infirmary in quarter 4 of this year.  A new theatre complex is also being built in the South Infirmary which will create two new theatres, one of which is expected to be completed in quarter 1 or quarter 2 of next year.  We need to get away from the situation where people need to travel to Northern Ireland and provide the services locally.  For the Deputy's constituents in Cork, we should be providing that service in Cork and that is what I am determined to achieve with the Minister.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700014#M00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1623923100,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

In addition to the enhanced facilities at the South Infirmary, a new medical ophthalmology service funded by the South\/South West Hospital Group is due to commence in August and will be based in St. Mary's health campus in Gurranabraher.  The service will be provided following the recent appointment of two new additional medical ophthalmologist consultants and support staff.

It will be clinically tasked with reviewing 3,000 patient referrals on current outpatient waiting lists.  That is a very important reform.<\/p>  <p>  I have looked at the breakdown of the services that people need in Northern Ireland when they have travelled there.

I also referenced the EY report, Supporting Excellence: Capital Project and Programme Delivery Capability Review.

It will also help facilitate a more environmentally-efficient use of technology across Government.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Government data centre is to deliver high-quality data centre facilities which are fit for purpose and are capable of meeting the Government&rsquo;s requirements now and in the future.  In doing so, it will support and enable the Civil Service Renewal 2030 strategy, the Public Service Data Strategy 2019-2031 and the Government&rsquo;s 2021 digital strategy and thereby provide a much better experience of Government services for the people of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700016#O00700","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1623924300,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

With regard to the skills and talent required, we can be thankful that there is no shortage in north Kildare.  In the context of employment opportunities, however, particular skill sets are required for any technology project.  Such skill sets will be required for any data mining that might follow on from this project and to operate this single view of the citizen.  There are also synergies with our Defence Forces, some of whose members may have been trained in those areas.  Perhaps we could begin to build a centre of excellence for these skills in Ireland.  In light of the recent cyberattack on the HSE, we must also be alert to cybersecurity concerns.

I have been looking at the area of public procurement and data collection, analysis and review in this area needs to be improved.  A shared data centre could help to improve the interoperability of public administrative databases and could help cut down on data entry and the collection of duplicate data.  As part of the drive towards digitisation, efforts are being made to cut down on paper records as these are seen as less efficient.  However, it is equally inefficient to have multiple people across multiple Departments collecting the same, or similar, information.  I welcome the data centre on that basis but I do, however, have concerns as to how it will operate.

By way of further background, this facility is initially designed to accommodate 600 racks.  The project is initially intended to replace four of the State's most essential data centres, which are operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with one purpose-built data centre facility owned and operated by the Government.  It is intended to then make the facility available to organisations across the public service.  With regard to the timeline, it is intended for construction procurement by the Office of Public Works to take place in the third and fourth quarters of this year, for the tender to be awarded and contracts signed in the fourth quarter and for construction to commence in the first quarter of next year.  It is hoped that the facility will be completed and commissioned by the end of 2023.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the environmental impacts of this data centre in particular, it has been designed to be at least twice as efficient as most existing data centre facilities.  This represents a large saving of power in the new purpose-built facility.  In conjunction with the construction of the data centre, a sustainable energy project is being pursued on the site by the Office of Public Works.  This may potentially involve photovoltaic solutions.  In addition, hardware rationalisation and upgrading physical to virtual programmes will be a key part of the migration project from existing server rooms to the new Government data centre, which will see both a reduction in overall hardware and the upgrading of hardware to modern energy-efficient models.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Lawless that the centre will be designed to adhere to industry security standards and will be certified to the International Organization for Standardization security standard, ISO 27001.

We know there has been a sharp rise in the number of such centres operating here.  In fact, a report prepared by the data hosting industry confirmed that the number of operational data centres in the State increased by 25% in the past year.  The data centre industry currently consumes 11% of the energy generated on the grid and that is forecast to rise to almost one third by the end of the decade.  Not only does it consume significant amounts of electricity, it consumes large amounts of water.  For example, the average data centre uses an estimated 500,000 l of water per day.  However, a particular data centre in Dublin reported it could use up to 4.5 million l of water per day.   At a time when our offshore islands are experiencing water rationing, that is mind-boggling.

In addition to publishing the strategy, the launch provided an opportunity to highlight a number of projects undertaken across the Civil Service that show the important work carried out by civil servants up and down the country, particularly in responding to the challenges we have faced over the past 18 months.  The strategy provides an ambitious framework for the future for the Civil Service and its staff.

It provides a long-term framework for continuous improvement and is focused on achieving meaningful outcomes for society, the Government and stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy's vision is for \"an innovative, professional and agile Civil Service that improves the lives of the people of Ireland through excellence in service delivery and strategic policy development\".  It has three core themes, namely, delivering evidenced-informed policy and services, harnessing digital technology and innovation, and building the workforce, workplaces and organisation of the future.  The strategy's development is the result of an extensive consultation process informed by experience and expertise from across the Civil Service.  A task force of senior officials, representing all of the Civil Service management board, CSMB, Departments and offices, has shaped the strategy.  It draws on evidence collected from staff engagement during the implementation of the first Civil Service renewal plan and the results of the 2020 Civil Service employee engagement survey.  It is also informed by the lessons learned in the six organisational capability reviews completed to date and the civil and public service response to the challenges of Covid-19.  The strategy acknowledges the environment in which the Civil Service operates and identifies important challenges facing the service now and in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy will be implemented through a cycle of three-year action plans.

The Revised Estimates for Public Services 2021 outlined an overall Government expenditure ceiling of &euro;87.8 billion.  This provided for both an increase in the core expenditure allocations to Departments and for almost &euro;12 billion in funding to respond to Covid-19 and Brexit.<\/p>  <p> In 2021 to date, Covid-19 has continued to pose a huge challenge for society and continued measures have been necessary to support our people, businesses and the delivery of public services.  Within the overall expenditure ceiling, &euro;5.4 billion was set aside in reserve to be used as required during the year for temporary targeted measures to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.  This reserve was partially utilised to fund the extension of the PUP and the employment wage subsidy scheme to the end of June.  In this regard, and including expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund, the further Revised Estimate for the Department of Social Protection, presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann recently, reflects additional gross expenditure of &euro;4 billion.  In addition to this, further Departmental Estimates will be presented to the D&aacute;il in due course, reflecting the various measures set out in the national economic recovery plan.<\/p>  <p>  Given the exceptional level of funding being provided this year, careful monitoring of spending against profile and progress on programmes and projects is required.  It is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister to manage expenditure within their respective allocations.  During 2021, the main spending Departments will be reporting to government quarterly on their respective areas.  <\/p>  <p>  Based on departmental Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il to date and as set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure to the end of May amounted to nearly &euro;33 billion.  While this is nearly &euro;1.5 billion ahead of the same period in 2020, the public health restrictions in place this year have impacted on spending plans of Departments.

For example, in respect of Covid-related costs, we had made provision for around &euro;12 billion of expenditure, given the length of the restrictions that were imposed in the early part of the year.  The decisions made in the national economic plan to extend supports in some instances to the end of the year means that the Covid-related expenditure is now more likely to be around &euro;15 billion rather than &euro;12 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the underspends require context.

When it comes to capital expenditure, there will be pressure because of the shutdown of construction earlier in the year.  That explains why there are significant underspends.

The initial focus of equality budgeting was on gender, following which the initiative was extended to other dimensions of equality.  Twelve Departments are now reporting equality budgeting metrics.  An expert advisory group was established to guide development of equality budgeting policy.  It has met regularly since September 2018.  In 2019, the OECD published a report on equality budgeting in Ireland, providing 12 recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward.

Retrofitting and even the incentives for the purchase of e-cars are actually quite regressive.  This is a view I have heard for a while, namely, that many of the incentives favour those people who have relatively positive incomes and savings.  For example, when retrofitting a house, people need to have substantial savings before they can take advantage of the grants.  The grants are generous but in order to take advantage of them, one must have substantial savings.  Similarly, with the bike-to-work scheme for e-bikes, they are an expensive piece of kit and the tax incentive is generous but people need to have a lot of cash in hand in order to purchase them.

Irish speakers have been waiting for more than 15 years for basic rights and recognition to be delivered.  I note that the leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots, has agreed to nominate Mr. Givan for the position of First Minister this morning.  I hope that that commitment is delivered upon.  I wish my colleague, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, the very best as she takes up the position of joint head of Government in the North again this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  Two significant reports published by the Central Bank and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, yesterday show that house prices are continuing to rise and show no sign of slowing.  We have seen time and time again in the context of the CSO&rsquo;s property price index - this was shown again yesterday - that prices have increased by 4.5% State-wide in the past 12 months.  The Central Bank has stated that there is a massive imbalance between supply and demand.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that this is as a result of the Government's and Fine Gael&rsquo;s refusal and failure to adequately invest in housing over the past decade.  The Central Bank states that this is likely to fuel significant house price growth in the medium term.  This, of course, will have knock-on effects on rents.  Homes are increasingly out of reach for ordinary workers and families.  This includes many people on decent incomes.  I genuinely think that the Government simply does not get it or does not understand the scale of the problem and the level of the anger that is out there.<\/p>  <p>  As house prices continue to rise, it is becoming even more difficult for renters and others to save when so much of what they get in their pay packets is eaten up by rent and other living costs.  Many see home ownership as an impossible dream.  Regrettably, that is an outlook that Fine Gael and the Government have imposed on so many people.  We need to reverse this trend and we need to do it now.  We need to start providing people with hope.  We must support those who cannot afford to move out of their family homes, those who are paying exorbitant rents and those who are struggling to access affordable accommodation or own their own homes.<\/p>  <p>  Action must be taken now.  That means supply-led solutions.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that it is not just Sinn F&eacute;in that is saying this.  Yesterday&rsquo;s reports from the Central Bank and the CSO follow on from the recent assessment by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to the effect that the State must and can double capital investment in housing.  This is a policy that Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on those in power to adopt for years, only for our pleas to be arrogantly dismissed by Fine Gael and the Government.  It is time to implement our proposals.  The Government has an opportunity, in budget 2022, to truly make a difference for these ordinary workers and those struggling to buy homes.  In the interim, we need to see real action to help those who have been caught in the rental trap.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Government take on board what Sinn F&eacute;in and the ESRI are advocating, namely, the doubling of capital investment in the October budget in respect of homes that people can afford?  That is the bar that we expect the Government to reach in the budget.  Will it even try to do so?  We also ask the Government to move to ensure that renters are protected by a three-year ban on rent increases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700021#T00600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1623927300,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much for his question.  I start by joining him in welcoming the agreement that was reached last night to appoint a new Executive and a new First Minister, Paul Givan, and facilitate the reappointment of Michelle O&rsquo;Neill as deputy First Minister.  Mr. Givan and Ms O'Neill are now co-equals and joint heads of the Administration in Northern Ireland.  Despite the fact that one of their titles may suggest otherwise, they are joint leaders of that Administration and should be treated as such.  I look forward to meeting them on Friday should the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council go ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that we have agreement on an Irish language Act, Acht na Gaeilge, going ahead as well as increased legal protections and rights for Ulster Scots speakers.  This should not threaten anyone&rsquo;s identity and it is supported by the majority of parties and people in Northern Ireland.  There is a Welsh Language Act, a Gaelic Language Act in Scotland and an Official Languages Act here.  What was agreed last night has been a long time coming.  A commitment was made by the sovereign Governments at St. Andrews a long time ago and a commitment was made by the parties in Northern Ireland to each other.  I look forward to seeing all of those involved honouring their commitments on language rights and legislation within the next year.<\/p>  <p>  Let there be no doubt that I am somebody who believes in homeownership, as does my party and the Government.  More than 65% of people in Ireland own their own homes.  We have one of the higher rates of homeownership in the developed world.  That is not because of Sinn F&eacute;in, it is because of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.   The problem we face is that that is not a reality for the vast majority of younger people.  By younger people, I do not just mean those in their 20s and 30s.  The situation has got that bad, I am also referring to people in their 40s.  It is our mission over the next three years to turn that around and make homeownership a reality again for many more people than is the case today.<\/p>  <p>  On property prices, the Deputy is correct in saying that they are going up.  They went up by approximately 4.5% in the past year.  It is worth pointing out that, notwithstanding this, home values in Ireland are still substantially lower than was the case when they peaked 14 years ago.  Essentially, what has happened is that the Central Bank rules have been successful in putting a lid on house prices - they are less than they were 14 years ago - but they have caused rents to soar.  That is real problem and has created a perverse situation and a real paradox whereby houses are cheaper to buy than they were 14 years ago but many people cannot get adequate mortgage approval to buy homes.  They now end up paying more in rent than they would do if they were able to get an adequate mortgage.  I welcome the fact that the Central Bank is now reviewing its policy.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that this is a complex matter.  There is a concern that if we allow people to secure larger mortgages, it may cause house prices to rise.  Nobody wants that to happen.  At the same time, it may actually drive supply and get developers and builders into the space where they are building properties for amounts that people, if they can get mortgages, can afford.  All of that has to be worked out.  There is a potential role for Government in all of this.  If we look at the model in the Netherlands, for example, the Government there provides partial guarantees for first-time buyers to obtain mortgages for reasonably priced houses in order to protect them against negative equity.  Perhaps we can examine models in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question on increasing the budget for housing, we continue to do that.  We have increased that budget dramatically.  In 2016, 600 social houses were built.  In 2019 and 2020 it was more like 6,000.<\/p> <p>There has been a tenfold increase in the building of social housing by the State and its agencies in that brief period.  Once we had the money to do it, we did it.  We will build on that, and the Deputy will see the details of that in Housing for All when it is published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700021#T00700","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623927900,"counter":242,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste never fails to surprise me.

The problem relates to what the ESRI, the Central Bank, Sinn F&eacute;in and many others have been saying.  The issue is not about stimulating more demand, which will push up house prices.

After 12 reports costing &euro;1.15 million, we have learned that the taxpayer will be very lucky to emerge with any change from &euro;1.7 billion for this project.  A further review, by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the Department of Health, has been ongoing since last year, and the Minister for Health was given a draft of it in January.  In February, the Committee of Public Accounts was told the report would be concluded within weeks, at which point we would have some clarity on what the budget would be, and we could then expect to discuss that at a meeting of the committee.<\/p><p>There appears to be a new approach now that there is a new Secretary General.  A recent letter to the Committee of Public Accounts from Mr. Robert Watt stated, &quot;There is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs or dates, however hypothetical, even from the draft stages of the process, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract and very likely undermine the role of the Development Board in its ongoing engagement with the main contractor.&quot;  It is, essentially, telling us to butt out, that it is none of our business.  According to Mr. Watt, all of the most controversial information about this project, such as the cost and the timeline, is suddenly too sensitive to publish.  What a stroke of luck that appears to be for the Department.<\/p><p>Last year, the T&aacute;naiste told the House that if you want to keep the people's trust, you need to be transparent.  He needs to be transparent about this.  This is a huge project.  When the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>asked him about the escalating cost of the hospital in 2019, he replied that &quot;nobody will think it a poor investment&quot; when it opens.  Does he still believe this?  Millions of euro have been spent on reviews and further millions have been spent on consultants and PR companies.  Tens of millions of euro have been spent on a botched procurement process and 800 claims have been lodged by the contractor, up from 700 just four months ago.  There are children in this country who cannot access basic disability services and others who are awaiting surgeries for scoliosis, yet we are building the most expensive hospital in the world.  It is obscene.<\/p><p>Nothing has changed with the spec of this hospital since the estimate was calculated at &euro;900 million.  What has changed are the delivery time and the price tag.  We desperately need the new children's hospital but did we need to build the most expensive hospital in the world by mistake?  Will the T&aacute;naiste practise what he preaches about transparency?  Does he have any idea what the cost of the hospital will be or what the timeframe will be?  Does he have confidence in the hospital development board to manage the project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700022#U00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1623927900,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I do have confidence in the hospital board and the Department of Health to manage this project.  To answer the Deputy's question, it is my firm view that when this project is complete, few people will think it was a bad investment.  Those who have seen the facilities we now have in Blanchardstown and the first phase of that development, namely, the urgent care centre, will see what an improvement it is on the facilities at the Temple Street hospital, for example.  The same applied to the Luas, the port tunnel, Terminal 2 and Knock Airport.  There were many critics of the investment made in those projects, few of whom even recall today that they were critics.  Although when the hospital is built and commissioned, people will change their minds on this, I accept that in the meantime, it will be a controversial story and issue.<\/p>  <p>  On the analysis and costs, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has, at the request of the Minister for Health, undertaken an assessment of the project.  The board and the Department are nearing the finalisation of this detailed analysis and this will provide the appropriate assurances to the Government that there has been a robust analysis of the way forward to ensure the delivery of a world-class children's hospital.  In December 2018, the previous Government approved an investment decision of &euro;1.433 billion for the capital project.  Several items are not included in this figure because there is no price certainty for them, nor can there be any for the duration of the project, including construction, hyperinflation and the impact of Covid-19.  <\/p>  <p>  Until the analysis work is complete, it would be premature to speculate on any definitive budget or timeline updates.  I confirm that no revised estimate has been shared with the Government.  Since the analysis relates to a live contract, it is commercially sensitive and must remain confidential to ensure that the contractual relationships are not adversely affected and that the Government gets the best price at the end of the day.

It may be construed that I have a conflict of interest because my company sometimes works on repairing and replacing water mains.  However, in many parts of Kerry, especially mid-Kerry and the Killarney area, residents, businesses and hotels are faced with a constant barrage of outages day after day.  Residents in places like Barleymount, Aghadoe, Laharan, Pallas and Beaufort, from the Gap of Dunloe and all along the board of works road from Beaufort to Gearagh Cross, people are tormented.  People in the areas of Faha, Listry, Foynes, Milltown, Castlemaine and Farranfore are suffering outages day after day.  Even New Street in Killarney town had one the day before yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  The long and the short of it is the shambolic condition of the pipe network is the cause, much of which is obsolete and contains asbestos that needs to be replaced.  Many of these asbestos pipes have exceeded their 35-year lifespan, which means they should be replaced.  The large asbestos pipe on the central regional water supply from Lough Guitane through Killarney to Tralee, supplying our hospitals and more than 60,000 customers, is in a precarious condition and needs to be urgently replaced.  More often than not, it breaks in Farranfore on the N22.  If it were not for our excellent Kerry County Council water repair crews, under Freddie Bartlett and others, who use their vast experience, intelligence and expertise to repair the pipes as quickly as possible, save as much as water possible, build up the pressure and restore the supply to customers, the situation would be very much worse.  <\/p>  <p>  I also thank the fire brigade, which has had to be brought in recently to replenish water supplies in the Killarney and Aghadoe areas.  It cannot be right that the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and local authorities want these crews to move across to Irish Water.  These crews include engineers, technicians and general operatives who have given valuable service.  It is not fair or right to put them under such pressure to move across to Irish Water.  Many of them have worked for 20, 30 and even up to 40 years repairing water supplies for Kerry County Council.

As part of that, we are giving consideration to additional funding for Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is a difficulty, though not an insurmountable one, in that Irish Water is a State agency on the public balance sheet.  When it comes to allocating money for Irish Water, it has to compete with the health service, education and justice for capital funding.  The model we previously proposed was that it would be a publicly-owned utility, a semi-State company like the ESB, for example, which would be able to borrow against its own balance sheet and assets using income from charges.  That would have created much more money to invest in water and we could have done much more than we now can do, but that decision is made and the ship has sailed on that issue.  <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the point made by the Deputy.  We will do our best to find additional capital for Irish Water over the next couple of years but there is an opportunity cost associated with it.

The T&aacute;naiste fought hard for the leadership of Fine Gael; he will not walk away from it.  All my adult life I, and tens of thousands of women in this country, have fought very hard to be free from the shackles of the Catholic Church over our reproductive rights.  We won that fight three years ago when we won the repeal referendum.<\/p>  <p>  My question today is about the proposed new national maternity hospital.  A recent statement from the Religious Sisters of Charity claimed they will have no involvement in the management of St. Vincent's Hospital Group, the new private charity named St. Vincent's Holdings, but this is technically incorrect.  The nuns may no longer have any involvement in the day-to-day management of the hospital, but they may be able to appoint directors and are entitled to appoint the successors of the new holding company. <\/p>  <p>  The Religious Sisters of Charity say they have gifted the St. Vincent's Hospital site to the people of Ireland.<\/p> <p>I ask if the people of Ireland are obliged to accept a gift from nuns who were involved in the Magdalen laundries, in mother and baby homes and in running a hospital that refused to provide sterilisation, vasectomy or any reproductive rights to women and men.  They can take their gift.  If they want to give a gift of land for a new national maternity hospital, they should gift it to the State.  The women of this country and those of us who fought so hard should not go forward with a new national maternity hospital that is still dominated by the ethos of the St. Vincent's group.<\/p> <p> Recent statements by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Ministers, Deputies Stephen Donnelly and Eamon Ryan, say they intend to proceed with the Mulvey plan.  That plan was welcomed by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in 2016.  We should remind ourselves that predated repeal and repeal changed everything.  Unless the Government is intent on trashing the outcome of the repeal campaign, a couple of questions need to be honestly and firmly answered.  Even if those answers include a guarantee of full reproductive rights, including gender alignment, abortion and vasectomy, we still do not believe the nuns and we do not necessarily believe the Government because the facts speak for themselves.  The constitutional make-up of the new St. Vincent's holding group still allows for the voluntary organisations in the publicly-funded healthcare premises to maintain their private Catholic ethos.

At the outset, I would like to state that I believe we all respect and value the role played by the Religious Sisters of Charity in providing healthcare and education down the years when the State did not.  We all support the building of a new national maternity hospital at Elm Park.  We need it and women need those modern facilities.  Holles Street is a great hospital but it belongs to 200 years ago, not to today.<\/p>  <p>  There are problems in going forward with this project.  The Deputy and I agree on this more than she may believe.  The hospital will be owned by the State.

First is the ownership of the land the hospital will be built on.  That is not being gifted to the State but to a private charity.  It is proposed that there be a 99-year lease to the State.  We have a difficulty with that.  We do not think the safeguards around that are strong enough.  The land would be owned by a private charity rather than the State and only a 99-year lease would be provided.  Second, we have a difficulty with the governance of the proposed new hospital.  It will be a voluntary hospital.  That is okay.  There are many such hospitals and they work well.  However, the board will not be appointed by the Government.  That is a real difficulty because a hospital that is almost fully funded by the State should have a significant number or majority of members of the board appointed by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  That is the problem we face at the moment.

We cannot reduce the gap to anything shorter than that, as the licence and the manufacturer state there should be a 56 day gap or more between the first two doses.  We are doing that, but it will take a few weeks to operationalise it and it does depend on supplies.

Bad things happened too and they were absolutely wrong, but we should not lose sight of the good things that happened.  They are proposing to gift the land to a charity, not to the State or the people.  We would much prefer that it be gifted to the State, to the people, in that way.  We would even be willing to purchase it because that would be a better option too.  However, it is complicated.  It is on the site of another hospital which is a voluntary hospital and not a State-owned hospital.  We need to work it out.

Ireland's seafood sector has been among the most seriously impacted during this period.  My objective is to work with the industry to grow the sector and the coastal community supported by it in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's action plan for 2021 sets out the priority actions to be implemented this year to drive the development of a sustainable competitive and innovative seafood sector.  I have had ongoing engagements with stakeholders in the seafood sector since I took office at the start of the year.  Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 restrictions I have not been able to engage with people on the pier side.  In order to interact directly with members of coastal communities, last month I held a series of virtual town hall meetings with people from coastal communities around Ireland.  These virtual meetings allowed me to hear directly from those impacted by both the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit about their experiences and their ideas for the future of their communities.  In the coming months and subject to prevailing public health guidelines, I will visit our piers and harbours in person to meet fishers in their communities to hear at first hand their views on the industry.  I regularly meet fishing industry representatives and will do so again on Monday next with the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit on Ireland's seafood sector is, understandably, a major concern for all those involved in and connected with the fishing industry.  The trade and co-operation agreement between the European Union and the UK will have significant negative impacts on our fisheries sector and on coastal communities dependent on fishing.  The wider impacts of Brexit - for example, the disturbance of established routes to market and established supply arrangements - will also negatively impact on some of our seafood enterprises.  In March, I established a seafood sector task force to examine all the potential impacts and to make recommendations to me for initiatives that could be taken to provide supports for development and restructuring to ensure a profitable and sustainable fishing fleet, and to identify opportunities for jobs and economic activity in coastal communities dependent on fishing.  I also asked the task force to consider and recommend constructive actions that would help to alleviate the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland in the trade and co-operation agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The task force is chaired by Aidan Cotter, assisted by Margaret Daly and Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide.  It includes in its membership many representatives of our seafood sector together with a host of other experts from bodies that may have a key role to play in helping our seafood sector and coastal communities overcome this difficult time and continue to prosper.  Following seven meetings of the task force, I have received the interim report and I expect to receive a full report in the coming period.  A copy of the interim report is available on Bord Iascaigh Mhara's website.  The interim task force report supported by all members of the task force addressed the issue of burden sharing between member states and recommends a range of initiatives to address the quota reductions in the trade and co-operation agreement.  The task force recommended a series of actions targeted at the pelagic quotas and actions targeted on demersal quotas.  The interim report indicates that the recommended actions after further consideration by the task force will be set down and detailed in the main report.<\/p>  <p>  The interim report also recommends a voluntary tie-up scheme.  The task force recommends that the temporary tie-up scheme be put in place for the period from September to December for approximately 220 polyvalent vessels and beam trawlers directly impacted by the quota transfers under the trade and co-operation agreement with each vessel allowed to tie up for one calendar month.  It recommends the payments should be calculated based on average gross earnings over the 2017-2019 period, excluding the cost of fuel and food.<\/p>  <p>  Vessel owners must ensure that a certain percentage of the payment is distributed among the crew members of the vessel.  Crew members availing of the scheme must not take up alternative employment or claim benefits during the period of the voluntary tie-up.  While the refrigerated seawater pelagic segment which engages in intensive seasonal fisheries does not feature in the recommended tie-up scheme, the interim report recognises this segment has been subject to the largest trade and co-operation-related quota reductions - in the order of &euro;15.6 million in 2021.  The task force considered that because of the seasonal nature of pelagic fisheries it would be problematic to include these vessels in a tie-up scheme but it is actively exploring other possible short-term supports as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  The interim report of the task force also identifies a large number of possible actions that it may recommend in due course in its full report and that will seek to address the very inequitable share quota transfers to the UK that Ireland is being asked to bear under the trade co-operation agreement in comparison with other member states.  The report notes that the task force wants to give consideration to these possible actions, the challenges arising and how their actions may be progressed.  In the meantime, I will continue, as I have done since December, to take every opportunity to raise the inequity of the quota cuts burden on Ireland with the Commission and other member states.<\/p>  <p>  The next review of the Common Fisheries Policy is due to be completed by 31 December 2022 and I am committed to doing everything possible through the upcoming review to secure additional quota where possible for Irish fishers.  I will work closely with the fishing industry and in line with the recommendations of the final seafood task force report to advance the position of the Irish fishing industry in the Common Fisheries Policy review.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the inshore fishing sector, the interim report of the task force recognises the difficulties being faced by vessels targeting non-quota species, including inshore vessels of less than less than 15 m.  While these vessels are not directly impacted by the quota transfers under the trade and co-operation agreement, they have suffered losses resulting from logistics and route-to-market issues arising from Brexit.  The interim report notes that the task force is actively exploring short-term support measures for the inshore sector with a view to making recommendations in its final report.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government and my action plan for 2021 contain strong commitments in the context of supporting the inshore community and the wider seafood sector in achieving their potential.  Work continues to implement the strategy for the Irish inshore fishery sector 2019 to 2023.  This is the first industry-led strategy for the Irish inshore fishery sector.<\/p>  <p>  In the terms of reference I gave the task force, I had asked that it consider how all available funding streams could be used to address to the extent possible the initiatives identified and the State agencies to support these initiatives.  In its interim report the task force noted that its full recommendations will in due course give rise to substantial public expenditure and recommends that during the 2021-2023 period, the measures necessary to implement the task force recommendations should to the greatest extent possible be funded from Ireland's EU allocation under the forthcoming Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR.  EU negotiations on the BAR are still ongoing but all going well Ireland expects to receive nearly &euro;1.2 billion in current prices.  The BAR is fully EU funded and its objectives are to provide support to counter the adverse consequences Brexit is having on the worst-affected member states.  Of course, the BAR is not specific to our seafood sector there will be many competing demands for funding from Ireland's allocation under the BAR.  Nevertheless, I am firmly of the view that the seafood sector is a priority sector for funding under it.  The impacts of Brexit are being felt across our economy and any support measures for our seafood sector proposed to be funded under the BAR will also need to be considered at Government level in the context of competing demands from other areas of the economy the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Another important funding source for the recommendations of the task force will be the new seafood sector development programme for the 2021-2027 period that is being prepared in my Department.  Similar to the current European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, programme for 2014 to 2020, which has been very successful in disbursing its &euro;240 million budget, the new programme will be an important source of funds for the development of our seafood sector and for coastal communities.  I anticipate that the new programme will be ready to send to the EU for its consideration by year end and will be operational early in 2022.  In the meantime, I have agreed arrangements for an interim capital support scheme for fisheries, aquaculture and processing funded under the new programme.<\/p> <p>This will allow fishers to continue investing in energy efficiency, value adding and health and safety measures on board and will allow our aquaculture farmers to continue investing in growing their production.  The seven fisheries local action groups, FLAGs, have been successful as an innovation over the past four years and in disbursing &euro;12 million in grant aid to projects in our coastal communities.  This compares with just &euro;1 million under the pilot FLAG scheme which briefly operated before that.<\/p> <p> Demand for grants under the FLAG scheme has far outstripped available resources.  This level demonstrates the phenomenal entrepreneurial spirit which exists in our coastal communities, with many new marine, tourism and leisure-related businesses seeking to take advantage of the fantastic natural assets we have around our coast.  To ensure the continued success of the FLAG initiative, my Department is working with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, to invite expressions of interest for FLAG groups for the 2021 to 2027 period under the new seafood development programme.<\/p> <p> Subject to the recommendations of the task force, I will be seeking to ensure the FLAG initiative continues to be well funded so it can achieve its potential and make an important contribution to growing prosperity in our coastal communities.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government recognises the importance of exports in Ireland's open economy.  This is key in the seafood sector which is largely export driven.  However, the Covid-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to our traditional seafood markets and supply chains.  Ireland's top five export partners for seafood, France, the UK, Spain, Italy and China, were all severely impacted, especially in the initial months of the pandemic.  Irish seafood exports were valued at &euro;590 million in 2020.  That was in the context of 2020 being an extremely fragile year, with both the domestic and export markets reacting to the ongoing challenges posed by Covid-19 and, of course, the UK's departure from the EU.<\/p> <p> Even in the context of these challenges, opportunities have emerged.  While exports to key markets in Europe and Asia fell, the value of exports to Africa and the Middle East grew by 87% and 43%, respectively, driven by increased exports of mackerel.  This year has shown some signs of recovery, as seafood exports to France and Spain grew by 76% in January in value terms, compared with the same period in 2020.  Re-establishing the presence of Irish seafood in our key markets, particularly in Europe and Asia, must be a priority for us throughout the remainder of this year.<\/p> <p> If we take 2019 as our baseline, pre-Covid, our seafood industry was worth &euro;1.22 billion to the economy.  Of this, exports comprised &euro;640 million and this is where Ireland needs to return to in the short term.  The Government's focus on and commitment to new market development also remain firmly on the agenda.  Up to December 2020, &euro;8 million had been allocated to Bord Bia under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund programme to augment existing funds and to promote Irish seafood in the domestic and international markets.<\/p> <p> A further allocation of &euro;2 million in 2021 will contribute to Bord Bia's overall seafood promotion strategy, which includes the recovery of lost market share as a result of Covid-19, the recruitment of new trade customers and priority markets and targeting an increase in consumption of Irish landed fish on the domestic market.<\/p> <p> The impact of Brexit on seafood trade is not yet behind us.  Throughout June and July, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, will be communicating the changes which will come into effect from 1 October this year, through the BIM Brexit hub.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will also host a series of industry webinars, commencing in early August, to outline how the 1 October changes will impact on Irish seafood businesses.  I encourage all Irish seafood producers to make use of these opportunities and to be Brexit ready.<\/p> <p> Turning to the aquaculture sector, in December 2016, the then Minister appointed an independent aquaculture licensing review group to review the process of licensing for aquaculture and its associated legal framework.  That report of the review group was submitted to my Department in May 2017 and a key recommendation of it was that my Department put in place a strategy to eliminate the backlog of licence applications.  This has been ongoing and has been the primary focus of my Department since the publication of the report.  It has resulted in more than 1,200 licence determinations being made since 2012.<\/p> <p> The backlog in shellfish licensing has now been eliminated as an issue affecting the industry and my Department is now focusing on maintaining the equilibrium with regard to shellfish licence applications and also addressing the backlog in marine finfish aquaculture licence applications.  The processing of these applications is, however, significantly more complex than the shellfish applications, not least due to the requirement that the application be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment and, in the case of applications received after 16 May 2017, an environmental impact assessment report.  This requirement is set out clearly in EU and national legislation and applications cannot be progressed in its absence.  My Department has been actively engaged with applicants on this matter and considerable progress has been made.  In the meantime, and pending the determination of applications for marine finfish aquaculture licences, national legislation provides for the continued operation of aquaculture sites by operators of their sites, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of their licences.  The progress made on both shellfish and marine finfish licensing will continue to pay dividends for both the aquaculture industry and coastal communities.<\/p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, fishery harbour centres are established under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 as centres in which to promote, develop and carry on sea fishing, including the production and sale of fish and fish products and related activities.  The six centres designated under the legislation are owned, managed and operated by the Department under statute.  The Department also has responsibility for North Harbour on Cape Clear Island for maintaining a range of piers, lights and beacons around the coast.<\/p> <p> Approximately 85% of fish landed into Ireland is now landed at the six centres.  The total value of all landings into these centres increased from &euro;224 million in 2013 to &euro;257 million last year.  In addition to the fisheries and seafood production industries, the harbours also accommodate ever-increasing amounts of diverse commercial business.  At the end of 2019, the centres were valued by the Valuation Office at &euro;456 million and I was delighted to recently announce a &euro;38.3 million capital investment package for them as well as for 79 local authority-owned piers and harbours.<\/p> <p> As I said when I announced the package, it is important to me to place added importance on the local authority scheme this year.  I was pleased, therefore, to be in a position to announce an enhanced &euro;4.2 million programme in 2021 to assist local authorities in the repair and development of their fishery and aquaculture-related marine infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Over the past year, our outdoor spaces have become even more important to us as an amenity.  The refurbishment of our harbours will support fishers and tourism and have many other benefits for local communities.<\/p> <p> It would be impossible to cover in detail every issue relating to fisheries and coastal communities today, but I have tried to provide an overview of some of the main issues and developments and will address some additional points in my closing statement.  I am acutely aware of the challenges facing the sector.  I assure the House this Government is committed to working with the seafood sector to meet those challenges and provide a clear path for the growth of our seafood sector and our coastal communities depending on it in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> I should have said at the start that I am sharing the remainder of my time with Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700028#EE00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623932100,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for facilitating this debate.  I express my disappointment at the lack of attendance in the Chamber for a debate on one of our most important sectors and the future of our coastal communities.  That illustrates the challenge we and the fishing sector have in highlighting the huge obstacles, barriers and challenges it faces in making the sector viable.  That is why a number of weeks ago, more than 70 boats  from around Ireland sailed into Cork Harbour up to the Cork City docks to prove a point and make known their huge frustration with the state of the Irish fishing sector.  It was a respectful demonstration.  The fishers made their points, which were valid, on issues such as the removal of the control plan, the need for immediate supports and measures for their industry and the measly quota share the Irish fleet has under the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p> <p>That is the point with which I will start.  When dealing with the fishing sector we quite often get bogged down, the message gets lost in terminology and species names and we miss the point.  The point is that the Irish fishing sector is correct.  Its share of quota species in EU waters is abysmal.  <br\/><br\/>In order to demonstrate that point in the easiest way possible, I have made a series of graphs, which are just visible on the screen.  This series of graphs shows areas in EU waters right around the island of Ireland and demonstrates the tiny quota share the Irish fleet has in respect of these different species.  These statistics are undeniable and irrefutable and are seen in the Common Fisheries Policy facts and figures document for 2020.  They clearly demonstrate that, in respect of the well-known species, hake, of a total pot of &euro;185 million, the Irish share is just &euro;10 million, a measly 5%.  Moving on to another very well-known species, haddock, of a total pot of &euro;20 million, the total Irish catch is &euro;1.6 million, a measly 7% share.  With regard to blue whiting, a species of fish particularly abundant in Irish waters, of a pot of &euro;67 million, the Irish share is &euro;8 million, or 11%.  With regard to monkfish, or anglerfish, again a very popular fish which is in demand, the statistic I have refers specifically to sector 7 and so is specific to Irish waters.  Of a total pot of &euro;124 million, the Irish share is just &euro;9.4 million, a share of 7%.  These facts are easy to follow.  My final statistic relates to prawns.  Of a total pot of &euro;112 million, the Irish share is a tiny &euro;1.5 million, or 1%.<br\/><br\/>What the industry is telling us is absolutely correct.  The share we are getting, after years and years of losing out on quota share, is not good enough.  That is why those in the industry are concerned.  That is why they are frustrated and want us to go back to Europe and fight a better fight for quota share.  It does not stop there.  We have seen a loss of &euro;15 million in our mackerel quota, which will increase to &euro;26 million by 2026.  To take a species like herring, the Irish Sea is only a few miles from here.  This is where herring are caught.  This is where west Cork boats have, for years, fished for herring in the Irish Sea.  Europe has given away 99.9% of the quota for that species.  I can testify that bluefin tuna is abundant off the Irish coast, particularly as we move towards the end of the summer and into August.  We have no quota for bluefin tuna while Japanese boats come to the west coast of Ireland to fish for this species.  I can therefore understand the frustration of the industry.  <br\/><br\/>It is plain for everyone to see.  The statistics are there.  I did not create them.  I took them from the Common Fisheries Policy.  We need to step up to the mark.  I commend the Minister and the task force on the production of this interim report but one of the most important points made within it relates to the whole area of burden sharing.  It says:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Task Force recommends that all options to alleviate the loss of quota share be pursued at every available opportunity and treated as a matter of urgency.  This should involve a whole of Government approach supported by a lobbying exercise by industry and Government at all EU levels.  <\/blockquote> <p>The industry is asking for help.  It is asking for us to go back to Europe and fight for better quota share.  We are an island nation.  We have this incredible resource right around our island that can sustain coastal communities and help them to flourish.  We need to look after it.  We cannot neglect it.  I implore the Minister, the Government and the State to step up to the mark.<br\/><br\/>Another point made at the protest related to the outrage at the removal of the control plan.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency, SFPA, came before a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine and failed to answer questions on the removal of that plan.  It failed to tell the committee why it was removed and when it will be brought back.  Its removal is leading to circumstances in which fishers right across Ireland are forced to weigh their fish on the pier.  On sunny days like today, that will have a very negative impact on the quality of our fish.  Fish is having to be de-iced, weighed and re-iced.  This process takes hours and has implications for health and safety.  Prior to that, the Irish industry weighed its fish in the factories.  It was traceable, transparent and safe.  That is what we need.  As soon as possible, we need the SFPA to step up to the mark and reintroduce a control plan for the pelagic and whitefish sectors so that fishers can continue to do what they had been doing safely, transparently and in a traceable way, which is to weigh their fish in the factories.  That needs to happen as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>The task force's interim report speaks about support measures for the pelagic sector and the refrigerated seawater, RSW, sector but also opens the door to supports for the inshore sector, as the Minister mentioned in his contribution.  That is something at which we really need to look.  The inshore sector may not have been impacted in the same way by the Brexit trade agreement but it has been severely impacted.  It has been impacted by both Brexit and Covid.  Restrictions have led to the closure of restaurants and facilities and a consequent drop in demand and significant drop in price for many shellfish species, of which brown crab is a perfect example.  Inshore fishers' income has been devastated in 2020 and 2021.  Through this task force, we now have an opportunity to step up to the mark and introduce a support scheme.  I have given the Minister the document from the National Inshore Fishermen's Association, NIFA, in which the association outlines some very simple, easy and achievable measures which would help to support the sector.  These include a continuity grant of, for example, 20% of 2019 turnover to help the industry survive, battle and get past this two-year period, which has been the toughest in the sector's history.  <br\/><br\/>The inshore sector is not just based in my constituency of Cork South-West or the Minister's constituency of Donegal.  In every port and harbour across the island of Ireland we have an inshore sector comprising small boats and bigger boats which are the lifeblood and lifeline of their communities.  They are what make these coastal communities tick.  We need to ensure that there is still an inshore fishing sector when all of this is done.  The opportunity has presented itself in the form of this task force and the document from NIFA which I have given to the Minister outlining a potential continuity grant.  I believe this grant could be the difference between this industry surviving and not surviving.  I plead with the Minister to read this document and take it on seriously.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has a challenging job.  I commend him on the establishment of the task force.  The measures outlined in the interim report are good and can be built on.  They can be the basis of a final report which will help this industry.  Whether it is funded through the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, or Revenue, we need to do everything we can to ensure that this industry, which is the lifeblood of many coastal communities, is viable and has a future.  Some 70 boats recently sailed into Cork Harbour to demonstrate the exact points I have been making.  There will be many more sailing into Dublin next Thursday.  I ask the Minister please to listen to the fishers' requests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700029#FF00200","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623933300,"counter":306,"content":"<p>We move to the Sinn F&eacute;in slot.

I commend the Deputy on the graphs providing a visual display of the utter injustice in terms of the allocation of quota to the Irish fishing fleet.<\/p>  <p>  The current percentage of Irish waters that are within the overall jurisdiction of the Common Fisheries Policy is 12%.  We have 12% of the waters but we were allocated 4% of the overall quota.  What we are actually receiving is one third of what we should get on the basis of our proportion of the seas.  What does that mean in real terms?  It means hundreds of millions of euro lost every year.  It means thousands of jobs in jeopardy.  As the Minister is aware, the industry currently supports approximately 16,000 jobs overall.  If we are getting one third of what we ought to be getting, one could argue that tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of euro will be lost because of the Government's repeated failure at least to try to renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy and stand up with regard to what has happened here.<\/p>  <p>  The Common Fisheries Policy is based on relative stability.  In other words, it is based on the practices that were in existence when we entered the European Economic Community, as it was back then.  Even though the capacity of our industry has grown, we have to adhere to the allocation based on the situation as it pertained many decades ago.  How unjust and unfair is that?  One sees the implications when one considers the species.  That is jobs and revenue lost to our coastal communities, many of which could desperately do with that extra fight.  The truth is that when it comes to fisheries policy, everybody who has operated in Brussels through the years and interacted with it knows that we are the laughing stock of Europe.  They just cannot believe that we have wilfully handed away so much of our own natural resources and the potential wealth of our coastal communities.  It is such a sorry thing to say that we are the laughing stock of Europe in that regard.  They cannot believe that we keep doing it year in, year out.<\/p>  <p>  This is all in the context of the EU-UK trade agreement.  Ireland, the country that is a victim of the Common Fisheries Policy in real terms, has been hit with another 15% of our quota cut, considerably more than any other fishing fleet, and &euro;43 million per year lost.  Here we are, almost six months later, and there is no evidence of burden-sharing.  Where is the fight from the Government for a fair outcome after the EU-UK trade agreement, especially considering what I have just said about the historical approach of Europe?<\/p>  <p>  I refer to bluefin tuna.  Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan was right to raise that issue.  The situation in respect of bluefin tuna is an absolute scandal.  It is one of the most lucrative fish in the world.  Thanks to species management internationally, it has been recovering in recent times.  It is plentiful in Irish waters but we have zero allocation of quota: nothing.  To add insult to injury, we are allowed to catch and release, so one can catch the fish with tourists and just release them again.  We are involved in scientific surveys.  For Christ's sake, it is unbelievable.  The fishing fleet of the European Union has had an increase of 78% - tens of thousands of tonnes - in the quota of bluefin tuna in recent years, but we have not been allocated a single fish.  Imagine what it would do for our inshore fishing fleet if they were to be given some of that quota.  Who is fighting for us?  Who is making this case?  It is absolutely astonishing.<\/p>  <p>  Senior officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have stood over this approach for many years under Minister after Minister.  We do not have a dedicated Minister of State for the marine, never mind an actual dedicated Minster for the marine at Cabinet.  We are the only island nation in the European Union but we do not have a dedicated Minister who would only focus on the marine and could deal with these senior departmental officials and get them to shape up and fight for a fair share of resources for this country.  It is astonishing.  The situation in respect of bluefin tuna alone tells one everything one needs to know about what is going on in terms of the State fighting for our people.<\/p>  <p>  The seafood task force has been established.  I have spoken to many people who are participating on it.  It is critically important that if it has agreed in good faith an approach we need to take, that approach is implemented with heart and soul and fire and passion.  We have ground and time to make up and we need to fight hard for our interests at European level.  That is critical.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  My God, if anything represents what is going on in fishing communities and what has gone wrong for so long, it is the performance of the SFPA.  As the Minister is aware, PwC did an analysis of that organisation.  It concluded the SFPA is dysfunctional, not fit for purpose and in need of urgent reform.  The utter failure to make that organisation work effectively in partnership with and with respect for fishermen and fish producers around the island has led to the disaster relating to the weighing system process.  In my opinion, based on the conversations I have had with fishermen around the coast, the SFPA views our fishing community as if they are criminals.  It assumes the fishers are guilty unless they can prove themselves innocent.  That is the type of culture that is there.<\/p>  <p>  Oversight and regulation are important.  We need to protect our precious resource and prevent overfishing.  I recently visited a fish factory in Killybegs and I saw fish being landed at the harbour onto a trailer with water that took them a short distance to the factory.  I saw the fish being weighed on a state-of-the-art and sealed weighing system with which only the SFPA can tamper.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland can come in unannounced at any time to see whether the weighing system is doing what it is supposed to be doing, but that was not enough.  That is a lot of oversight.  There are CCTV cameras all around the factory, looking down at this weighing system as the fish go over it.  Those CCTV cameras beam directly to the offices of the SFPA.  I cannot think of any other industry with that level of oversight, where the staff of the regulator can literally watch the entire process happening for as long as they want.  If that is not enough, they can come into the factory and look at the production end, where there is a trolley of fish in boxes.  Each box weighs 20 kg and there are 60 boxes on the trolley, so that is a total of 1.2 tonnes.  One can go into the freezer system.  My God, if you want to regulate them, you can regulate them.  You can regulate them to the nth degree.  In fact, our seafood sector is the most regulated in all of Europe.  How in God's name did we get to a situation where we have allowed the European Union and the European Commission to reach a conclusion that Irish fishers have overfished and are involved in widespread illegality?  Where is the evidence?  A whole industry has been accused of overfishing but it has not been given the evidence.  I submitted a parliamentary question on the matter to the Minister and his departmental officials said it cannot be released.  My God.  Can the Minister imagine a person being accused of a crime - the fishermen are being accused of a crime - and found guilty but not given the evidence?  The person is punished but was not given the evidence, so never had a chance to defend himself.<\/p> <p>The report was leaked to a number of organisations, which have behaved deeply unfairly by putting it into the public domain.  It was leaked to the media and certain organisations but was not given to the people who are facing accusations.<\/p> <p> Flowing from that is the utter disaster that is the SFPA and the way it has conducted itself on matters affecting people living on our coasts.  It is a dysfunctional organisation.  We now have a situation where every fisherman must weigh his or her catch, including non-quota species, on the pier or harbour.  Fishermen have to take the fish out of the iceboxes to do so.  Christ almighty, seafood regulations state that the cold chain must be protected.  The fish must be stored at the required temperature the whole way through the process and that must be guaranteed in respect of any sales that are made.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara is a good organisation that is trying to promote Irish seafood across the world and work with the industry to develop technology and standards.  It is trying to promote the tremendous seafood we have in this country.  However, fishermen are being told to take the fish out of the iceboxes and keep it in the open heat before putting it back again.  A system has been imposed that puts fishermen at an utter disadvantage relative to their competitors and undermines all the work of BIM.  One arm of the State is fundamentally undermining another arm of the State that is progressive and effective.<\/p> <p> The Government has never got a grip on the senior officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the SFPA.  This is happening on the Minister's watch.  He is a Donegal man from a coastal community.  He has been told at every single meeting he has attended around the coast what the issues are.  I commend him on the town hall meetings he conducted.  That engagement was a good initiative.  The Minister heard from the horse's mouth that the officials are completely out of synch with the communities with which they are supposed to work.  I will draw an analogy to illustrate the point I am making.  When it comes to policing, a garda who treats people with respect and uses common sense is a garda who is respected in the community.  He or she enforces the law while also explaining the law and respecting people in the community.  People will work with garda&iacute; like that.  However, where a garda treats people with contempt and like criminals from the start, and looks down his or her nose at them, then we have ineffective policing.  That is what the SFPA has become.  The agency was handed a template in Killybegs and I cannot believe it has not presented it to the European Commission and said: \"Look at the standard of regulation we have reached and the level of oversight we have in being able to watch people on CCTV and monitor what they are doing closely.\"<\/p> <p> The Minister needs to get a grip on the senior officials in his Department and the SFPA.  The seafood sector task force and the town hall meetings are the right way to go.  He has heard what needs to be heard.  As a fellow Donegal man who, like the Minister, has spoken to fishermen and people in all these coastal communities, I say to him it is time for big change.  It is time for the Minister to deal with his officials and tell them straight he needs them to fight for Ireland and do everything they can to rectify the wrongs that were done.  The Department needs to show the fishermen and fish producers it has their back and will fight for them with all its might and main.  If the Minister can achieve that, he may be able to deal with the protesting fishermen who are coming to Dublin next Wednesday and show them he is making a difference.  There were protestors here last week and there will be more next week.  If the Minister can deal with the issues both those sets of protestors are putting to him, he can look back on his days in government with great pride.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700031#HH00200","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623933900,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Two weeks ago, I met with fishers from Inis O&iacute;rr who raised two key issues with me.  First, they are deeply concerned at having to weigh the shellfish when they land it on Inis O&iacute;rr.  There is no account taken of damage to, or incidental loss of, the catch before it travels back again by sea to the factories.  The other key issue is the pier on Inis O&iacute;rr, which not only impacts fishers but the entire island community, which is one of the coastal communities we are discussing today.  Since I was elected to represent the Galway West constituency a year ago, I have been shocked by how island communities have been completely forgotten and neglected in almost every aspect.  Inis O&iacute;rr is a very good example of that neglect by successive Governments.<\/p>  <p>  I want to describe the hazardous nature of the pier on Inis O&iacute;rr for the benefit of the Minister, Deputies and any media representatives who are here.  If people were aware of how bad it is, there would uproar.  At the start of this year, videos were circulated, mainly in the Irish language media, of waves crashing over the pier wall, the force of which broke the lights on the pier.  One can imagine how dangerous it would have been if people had been on the pier.  The weather was bad but not that bad.  The damage meant the pier had to be closed and the boats could not dock, which not only impacted the people of Inis O&iacute;rr but also the people of Inis Me&aacute;in because the two islands share the same doctor.  Three mornings a week, the doctor from Inis O&iacute;rr goes over to Inis Me&aacute;in, which he could not do on this occasion.<\/p>  <p>  The redevelopment of the pier on Inis O&iacute;rr was contained in the Government's 2015 capital investment plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021.  Six years since it was promised, it is yet to happen.  There was good news with the announcement the pier was finally getting the go-ahead but that was followed by further delay, with no clarity as to when the project will go to tender.  It is unfair that the islanders are being left in the dark again.

I want to revisit those issues today and highlight the requests of the fishing industry in the county.  During our last debate on this matter, I invited the Minister to visit Dunmore East to see the opportunities that exist to restore the village to a thriving economic hub and revive the fishing industry.  I again invite him, especially now that restrictions have been eased, to come to Waterford over the summer period and meet with fishing and community representative groups in the east and west of the county to hear about, and see for himself, the current plight of the industry there.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the landing of fish from vessels based in Britain and the North in Dunmore East still has not been resolved.  The Minister has consistently said it would be kept under review, which I welcomed.  I ask again today how that review is going.  Locals in Dunmore East want this facility returned in order to generate additional economic activity.  The crews of the British and Northern vessels want it to return to prevent them from having to sail to Howth or Cork.  The SFPA, which would be responsible for overseeing any landing requirements on a limited-hours basis, has said it would not require any additional capacity to carry out the functions required.  I appeal to the Minister again to redesignate Dunmore East as a landing port for fish caught by British and Northern-registered fishing vessels.<\/p>  <p>  Investment in Dunmore East, as in any place, is key to its future success.  The existing fishing harbour is, at times, near full capacity.  The construction of an outer harbour would have a dual purpose in providing further safe landing space for the fishing fleet and also promoting Dunmore East as a welcoming destination for world cruise liner visits when that industry restarts in the time ahead.<\/p> <p>In the past, I have raised with the Minister the issue of a number of derelict buildings under the ownership of his Department that need a strategy to get them back into use, economic or otherwise.  There are local enterprises that have previously expressed interest in developing these buildings.  They have the support of the local authority to develop jobs and generate economic activity.  I am sure that the Minister and I want the same thing.  If there are derelict buildings that can be brought into use to generate economic activity, why are we not doing it or supporting it?<\/p> <p> I understand that leases for these buildings will go out for public tender again soon.  The last tender failed.  Once the next tender process is complete, I ask the Minister to engage with the local authority members and local economic representative groups to ensure that we can bring these buildings back into proper use and stimulate jobs in the area.  A ministerial visit to the site, or to any of the ports or fishing villages in Waterford, would be hugely beneficial.  I speak to fishers on a regular basis.  I know they would like to see the Minister come to Waterford and engage with them.  Those in the smaller inshore fleet, in particular, are under severe pressure at present to protect their livelihoods.  A sustainable and worthwhile future must be carved out for these fishers.  At present in Dunmore, the fishers, who are primarily middle-aged men, are obliged to climb across five and six boats to get access to their own boats to allow them to get out to fish.  The harbour master has deemed this to be a health and safety issue and perhaps a tragedy waiting to happen.  A small pontoon installed in the existing harbour would resolve this issue.  It is an example of the greater investment that is required and to which I have referred.<\/p> <p> I welcome the opportunity to engage in a debate on this issue again.  I previously wished the Minister well in his role.  I know that he is deeply committed to fishers and to ensuring that coastal communities are properly supported.  However, it must be all coastal communities right across the State.  As a representative of Waterford who engages with the fishing community and who is aware of the importance of the development of the harbour of Dunmore East and of communities in west Waterford, I invite the Minister to visit the area.  I also implore him to ensure that all ports, fishing communities and villages are properly supported in order that they can thrive and add economic value to the people who live in those areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700032#JJ00300","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623934500,"counter":312,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar cheist c&uacute;rsa&iacute; iascaigh.  I will begin by raising a small issue that perhaps the Minister can tackle for once and for all.  He mentioned that as Minister, he inherited six harbours and then he got Cape Clear.  Obviously, the Minister's Department did not tell him that he has a bit - I mean a bit - of Cleggan Pier.  The fact that half the pier is owned by the county council and the other half is owned by the Department has stymied the development of the pier for years.  I suggest that the Minister should transfer total ownership of the pier to the local authority and then allow it access to money to properly develop it because the local authority would have access to island funds, etc.<\/p>  <p>  N&iacute;or mhaith liom a bheith ag troid le comhghleaca&iacute; liom as mo Dh&aacute;ilcheantar agus n&iacute; thiocfaidh m&eacute; troid ach ceart&oacute;idh m&eacute; an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt s&iacute; tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.

N&iacute; beag an m&eacute;id &euro;100 milli&uacute;n a chaitheamh ar na hoile&aacute;in.  Chomh maith leis sin, tugadh isteach go leor sc&eacute;imeanna eile.

He promised me he will come and I know he will.  We have much to show him there.  He has appointed Malachy Walsh and Partners to carry out another review of the review of the piers.  We can live with that if this is the final and comprehensive review which takes the whole use which Rossaveal pier could be put to and takes into account all the State lands.<\/p> <p> The west coast has taken a battering in the context of the way that the Cinderella industry of Ireland, which should be one of our largest industries as an island nation, has been treated over the years.  There are still many people in the west with an interest in the sea.  There is no fishery port in the hands of the Department from Dingle to Killybegs, however.  The west coast is way longer than the east coast, a long stretch of sea.  The only port is Rossaveal but it cannot take the boats of any size.  To revive the industry of fishing and to start a renewable energy industry, we are asking for a modest project, which would cost approximately &euro;20 million, to proceed once we get this report.  I have no doubt the report will say it is worth going ahead with the deep-water pier in Rossaveal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700033#KK00200","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623935100,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Some Deputies are seeking copies of the Minister's speech.

While we might not agree on some matters, we can agree that the Common Fisheries Policy has not been great for Ireland.  It is archaic and dates back to the 1970s.  We can also agree that the latest trade deal, incorporating a 15% reduction in quotas, will lead to an additional loss to fisher of &euro;43 million.  We can further agree that we live on an island that is surrounded by water.  We can agree that we have potentially the richest fishing waters in the world, particularly if we go on the basis of our original fisheries map, which shows our waters reaching nearly as far as Greenland and includes a lucrative channel which runs in the direction of Scandinavia.  It is a no-brainer that the potential for growth in the fishing industry, including inland fisheries and processing, in Ireland is infinite.  I worked in processing and fishing a long time ago when we used to have the casual workers book.  I was very proud that one could actually earn a few bob during one's holidays, claim back one's tax and give a few bob at home.  It meant a lot to the local community.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to invest in maximising our fishing industry because it has the earning potential of &euro;2 billion.  I have seen in too many ports fish landed in boxes which then goes on a fork-lift and into the back of a lorry container, the doors shut and it heads for France.  There is no processing.  It makes absolutely no sense.  Earlier in the week, there was a news report about not being able to land mackerel by fishing line.  Many people around Ballycotton, Youghal and Cobh - we have 1,100 km of coastal areas in Cork - were terrified that they would not be able to sail a little vessel out with 12 or 14 lads on it.  It is the knock-on effect that makes me angry.  This should be an absolute no-brainer.  We are an island surrounded by waters with probably the best fish in the world, but we are not allowed fish in it.  The zone is now 12 miles off the coast.  I heard the EU wanted to only give us a coastal zone of only six miles.  That makes no sense whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  A knock-on effect of the development of the fishing industry in coastal communities would be the growth of businesses, such as in the context of the provision of icing machines.<\/p> <p>The most important thing here is the processing of Irish fish in Ireland and the quality of food that we have.  I appeal to the Minister, like many other speakers have said, to go back into Europe and to say we have had enough of being abused and of being taken for granted and that we will not take any more of this.  We need to take back what is rightfully ours.  We will certainly negotiate but we are surely entitled to a fairer share.  <\/p> <p> This what is happening here at the moment.  We saw this in Cork two weeks ago and it was a fabulous sight as the flotilla of all of the ships came into Cork Harbour, which a great many followed online.  This was not what one would call a protest but was a celebration of the industry and of all those families and generations who have lived on and by the sea and who just want to maintain what they have and their fair share.  We will see the same atmosphere in Dublin next week.  As elected representatives in this House for the people, we should be going back to Europe and saying that it can take its foot off the hand now.  We need to be able to stand up and stand our ground to say that we are entitled to what we should be getting here.<\/p> <p> One person I spoke to briefly before I came in here, and he did not mean this in any nasty way, but as a public representative for east Cork, he told me to ask the Minister how can he legally earn a living for his family.  That is the amount of fear that people have.  I appeal to the Minister to do the right thing.  Let us be strong against Europe and grow our fishing industry so that we can be very proud of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700034#LL00300","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623935700,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Over the past few months in our discussions of the Common Agriculture Policy, CAP, the Minister has repeatedly informed me that his position is to seek as much national discrepancy, or flexibility as he calls it, as possible for CAP funding.  He also informed me that the national CAP plan is &ldquo;a matter of engaging fully with farmers throughout the country on what our plan should look like, and fully consulting everyone before I, as Minister, make any calls on that\".  I may disagree with the ambivalence of the Minister&rsquo;s position on CAP, but if that is the standard he wishes to take, that is fine.  He is committed to engaging extensively with relevant stakeholders before making significant decisions.  However, he is obliged to be consistent.  Fishing communities have not, in any way, received the same level of consideration and consultation.<\/p>  <p>  From the disastrous Brexit deal announced on Christmas week to the ongoing issues with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority weigh systems, fishing communities have not been consulted with, apart from an online town hall meeting he referred to after all of these decisions were made.  Moreover, they feel the Government is actually working against them in many cases rather than with them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has to recognise the double standard here, and why fishing and coastal communities are feeling abandoned.  I also note how the lack of engagement with coastal and fishing communities regarding the Marine Jurisdiction Bill is indicative of how the Government views these areas and does not bother engaging with them.  <\/p>  <p>  There are numerous significant issues for the sector which have been highlighted at recent protests, including the unfair trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, between the UK and the EU and the absence of natural justice from the penalty points for fisheries offences.  These are, of course, symptoms of the Government&rsquo;s lack of engagement with these communities.  If the Minister commits to anything today, can it please be to bring the same energy and commitment to engaging with fishing communities as he does for others?  Will he have consultations across the country with these communities, and as part of that will he ensure to engage with all fishing communities? <\/p>  <p>  The closure of the artisanal hook and line fishery for mackerel for vessels under 15 m in length is another example of a regressive step.  As a result of this change, even the smallest vessels in the fleet can no longer go out and catch a few dozen mackerel for sale at the likes of a farmers market.  This a fishing method which is probably, we can all agree, the most environmentally friendly of all.  <\/p>  <p>  When one consider that simultaneously 98% of the quota is allocated to 49 larger boats, the mind boggles.  For anyone who does not know, and I do not believe that many people do, the mackerel quota is distributed nationally by ministerial policy.  I ask the Minister how is it that fewer than 50 boats are getting 98% of the quota, while only 2% of the quota is being allocated to the inshore sector of almost 2,000 boats.  This is the sector that has the most sustainable type of fishing practices which we should all be supporting.  This is blatantly a policy for the few and not the many.  Our inshore fisheries are more environmentally friendly and use the kind of fishing practices that have been going on in coastal and island communities forever.  This is also where the vast majority of employment is in the sector.  What is the Minister actually doing?  Can he please explain to us or justify how this has happened, where 2% of the fishing quota is going to where the vast majority of the employment is in the sector with the most sustainable practices, and where 98% of the quota is then going to 50 boats?  For almost two years, representatives of the inshore sector have been seeking a very modest increase in that 400 tonnes.  Regrettably, these requests are getting nowhere and the lack of a producer organisation, PO, status for many in the inshore sector is a component of this.  They have made reasonable requests that the quota is allotted to recognise that the 400 tonnes set aside for the line-caught mackerel is insufficient to allow the over 1,000 boats under 15 m to manage.<\/p>  <p>  The fishing season is being cut short due to the quota being landed early, which has knock-on effects for fishers, other workers whose livelihoods depend on it, and coastal and island communities on the whole.  Line-caught is an inherently sustainable model given its low impact nature, the absence of by-catch, and the short fishing window each day.  I ask the Minister to engage with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum on this issue immediately.  In the overall scheme of things a small adjustment to this quote will make the world of a difference for the inshore fishers and to our coastal and island communities.   <\/p>  <p>  Related to that, as I have said, is the PO status of inshore fishers and while I welcome the progress in recognition of the island inshore PO, it is essential that the Minister continues to prioritise the granting of PO status to small-scale representative groups to better reflect small and family businesses.  There are things in respect of inshore fisheries that we do not hear enough about such as small piers.  I can think of many examples in my own constituency but to give one, the pier at Turkhead, almost 20 people are making a living off that pier, with many commuting out to islands.  It is used as a public amenity for things like kayaking and the pier literally drops off.  There is not even a slipway there or somewhere to turn.  There are vans in different scenarios where the back wheels have gone off the pier because there is absolutely no infrastructure there for them.  <\/p>  <p>  Like I said, this inshore sector represents the vast majority of employment of fishers in the country.  They do not even get a hearing.  I was on the coastal management committee on Cork County Council for a brief period but at the first meeting I remember saying that we might as well not bother talking about all of the different areas that need work and start talking about how we get more funding because Cork is a very large county with a very significant coastal area that does not have the funding to provide the basic infrastructure for small fishing families to make a living.  Finally on this point, can the Minister outline the actions he has taken in response to the Norwegian Government unilaterally increasing its share in the mackerel fishery by 55%?<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight the need for greater commitment around ensuring fairer, sustainable and ethical practices in the fishing sector.  Ultimately, the continuity of the sector relies on good fishery management but this needs to be operated with communities rather than the top-down approach we have now.  Communities need to feel that State services are working with them and only then will we have a successful model.  <\/p>  <p>  Regrettably there are a small minority who engage in practices such as illegal fishing or the abuse of workers.  We need more robust mechanisms to detect and punish these crimes, which not only cause environmental harm and violate the rights of individuals but also harm legitimate fishers in the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  We know that there are undocumented migrants operating on some vessels and we know this is a highly vulnerable cohort given their precarious position.  Can the Minister elaborate on his commitment to ending abusive employment practices in the fisheries and give an assurance to any undocumented persons or their advocates that they can come forward and that the undocumented individual will not be themselves punished or, indeed, deported as a result of reporting a crime?  Can the Minister outline how he intends to work with fishing communities to stamp out illegal fishing?<\/p>  <p>  As we recover from Covid-19, we have considerable potential to re-imagine and invigorate our marine sector and help develop our coastal and island communities.  There are many different ideas for this.  One is of a national marine park and there are examples of this in other countries like Wales, where it takes into consideration the local, social and economic importance of the fisheries sector but does not mean eliminating the practices, although it sometimes is perceived like that.  This could support our inshore fisheries, our tourism and greatly help coastal and island communities on the whole.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the lack of consultation, the Marine Jurisdiction Bill and the national marine planning framework have the potential to redefine our relationship with the sea and our maritime space.  We have an opportunity to grow our blue economy, creating more jobs in coastal communities while delivering a healthy marine environment that is resilient to the mounting pressures of biodiversity loss, climate change and pollution.  This can only be achieved by working directly with people.  This requires a cross-departmental approach.  At present, fishers have to go to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for issues around offshore developments, while the Department of Foreign Affairs is handling the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill.<\/p>  <p>I think we all agree we need a unified approach centred on the needs of coastal and island communities, and the Minister needs to take leadership on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700035#MM00300","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623936300,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh.<\/p>  <p>  An extensive part of the constituency of Cork East is coastal.  The communities involved in the fisheries in Youghal and Ballycotton, in particular, have expressed significant concern to me about the level of investment in our local coastal infrastructure.  From the standpoint of the aquacultural and marine activity in my constituency, I am concerned about the level of coastal erosion taking place around the existing pier infrastructure at a number of locations in my constituency.  In particular, I single out Knockadoon, a beautiful head near Youghal.  It is a very small place.  All it has is a walking trail.  There is a Dominican camp there and limited fishing activities take place at the head.  Unfortunately, the area around the existing pier has been badly damaged by significant coastal erosion.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister for assistance with that issue, because funds are needed for Knockadoon, but also for assistance with Ballycotton, a beautiful village in my constituency.  It is famous for its local scenery but also because of the fish that is landed at the pier.  It supplies many restaurants throughout the region.  Many of the top restaurants in the country are located in County Cork and Ballymaloe House is just up the road from Ballycotton.  Obviously, it is of great importance for our local economy to ensure the operations at Ballycotton pier are seamless.  The fishermen and women involved in fisheries are very concerned about the damage that has been done over a long period at Ballycotton.<\/p>  <p>  I raised this matter in the House previously with the Minister and was a little disappointed with the level of funding granted.  We received just &euro;54,000 towards the pier in the latest round of grants but the level of work required will run well into the hundreds of thousands of euro, potentially close to &euro;500,000, to upgrade the sea wall.  I am working with Cork County Council, which will report back to me, as requested, on the significant levels of damage done thus far and also on what is required.  I again ask the Minister to examine this matter.  In comparison with the other constituencies in the county, the grant is drastically smaller than what they were allocated, as he will clearly see when he looks at the figures from his Department.  I would like that to be rectified, if possible.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the Minister is committed to addressing the issues facing fisheries and I respect that.  In his constituency of Donegal, too, they form a major part of that local economy, and the same has to be said about my constituency.  In that context, I would be delighted to welcome the Minister as soon as possible to the constituency of Cork East to engage with people working along our coast.  From an agricultural standpoint in his Department, he is very welcome to come to Cork East, where he will receive a great welcome from the people, who want to engage with him on a number of positive issues on which we believe the Department could have a proactive and helpful interaction with our constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700036#NN00200","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1623936300,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I raise a few issues arising from my observations as a representative of a coastal community and fishing area and from concerns raised with me by civil society groups and representatives of fishers and other workers in the fishing sector.  I have spoken on a number of occasions in the House about the marine and coastal environment in the context of Brexit and its related challenges for the sector and the increased challenges posed by climate change and fishing activities that undermine our overarching goals to protect our marine environment.  I have spoken separately to the need to reinstate landing rights for UK-registered boats into Dunmore East to fill the gap that exits on the south-east coast, from Castletownbere to Howth.  I echo Deputy Cullinane's invitation to the Minister.  He seems to be popular; we all want a visit from him.  Donegal to Waterford is about as far as one can travel, but there are fishing communities from Cheekpoint to Ceann Heilbhic, and the Minister can continue on to east County Cork and make a good day of it.  We will all warmly welcome him and make his worth his while, with the blaas at the ready.<\/p>  <p>  All these issues are strongly interlinked.  We need healthy marine environments to maintain local coastal economies and safeguard against external challenges, and healthy marine environments depend on stronger measures to protect and regulate those very environments.  On the subject of protecting our marine environment, it will come as no surprise if I raise the important issue of marine protected areas, MPAs, and the Government's commitments to legislating for MPAs in Irish waters and to realising existing commitments for marine protection in the marine strategy framework directive.  MPAs can and should play a vital role in rebuilding marine populations and habitats, which directly contribute to the resilience of marine populations and coastal communities to climate change.  MPAs will also serve as crucial sources of information in future years in regard to the impacts of climate change on marine environments and how marine ecosystems respond to our changing climate and warming and acidifying oceans.  All in all, in achieving our objectives to expand MPAs, we will safeguard the very ecosystem on which fishers, coastal communities and the broader economy depend.<\/p>  <p>  We will also fall into step with many of our European neighbours, who are making progress in the same direction.  Through the wider European network of the Green Party and associated movements, colleagues in Brussels tell me of inspiring initiatives in countries such as France, Italy and Norway, where MPAs have been broadened to protect both smaller scale and artisanal fishers, as well as fish stocks and the marine ecosystem.  In the Mediterranean region, a network of MPAs is piloting nine projects aimed at strengthening and empowering MPAs and the people working to sustain them.  The projects include supporting small-scale fishing in MPAs, the conservation of mobile species and the development of sustainable fishing mechanisms for MPAs.  This represents a great opportunity, particularly for our inshore fishing fleet, into the future.<\/p>  <p>  We can take inspiration from these examples demonstrating that there is much to gain from establishing and expanding marine protected areas, but doing so will require more human capacity, research and skills, financial resources and, importantly, public and political support.  That nine tenths of our territory is marine is often overlooked in our politics.  We need to build our overall awareness of our marine environment and the role it plays in the economy as a whole.  To this end, my Green Party colleagues and I look forward to engaging further on the ongoing process to prepare legislation for the MPAs, led by the Minister's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.<\/p>  <p>  On a related subject, I raise the issue of the EU fisheries control regulation, an essential tool to monitor and manage fish stocks throughout EU waters.  Environmental and conservation groups have expressed concern about certain deficiencies in the control system allowing for the continuation of unregulated and possibly illegal fishing activities in both EU and Irish waters.  It does not need to be said that without proper controls, regulation and oversight, our broader sustainability goals and those related to MPAs, which I highlighted earlier, will be directly undermined by malpractice throughout the sector.  Conservation groups have strongly advocated for action such as safeguarding against the under-reporting of catches, the expansion of tracking and catch reporting to all vessels in the EU, improved seafood traceability and greater transparency at a national level of fishing control efforts.  I imagine these concerns have come to the Minister's attention too and I urge him to engage with fishing and coastal communities, as well as environmental groups, as EU discussions on the fisheries control regulation continue.<\/p>  <p>  A separate issue I raise relates to the welfare of fishers from non-European Economic Area, EEA, countries working on Irish vessels.  A number of other Deputies and I have been contacted by the International Transport Workers Federation, ITF, about the vulnerability of non-EEA fishers working on Irish fishing vessels and the challenges they face.  The ITF has raised a number of concerns surrounding the employment of non-EEA workers, ranging from their working conditions and safety to their employment rights.  The atypical working scheme, under which non-EEA workers are eligible for employment on fishing vessels, provides some solution to ensuring appropriate working conditions but a number of problems persist.  Many workers remain undocumented and thus highly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.  Even when they are correctly documented under the atypical working scheme, they still face exploitation in the form of major overwork, underpayment and hazardous working conditions.<\/p> <p>Some fishers have been injured on the job, with no protection measures to support them while they are not working.  Others have testified to circumstances where over-quota catches have been hidden from the authorities.  As an island nation with a proud legacy of thriving coastal and fishing communities, it is important that we properly protect all workers in this sector.  They are a vital part of the fishing community and work in extremely challenging circumstances to keep the industry going and maintain our fishing supplies.<\/p> <p> I am conscious this issue falls across a number of Departments, not just the Minister's, and, therefore, more co-ordinated efforts will be needed to address both policy-related and more practical challenges facing these fishers.  The Minister's Department has an important and pivotal role to play as the focal point for the entire fishing sector and for fishers from all levels of the industry in particular.  I welcome the chance to have addressed the Minister in respect of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700036#NN00300","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623936900,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important topic.  The north County Dublin coastline is one of the most beautiful and, indeed, productive parts of our island.  Its coastal towns and villages are home to great scenery and a vibrant fishing industry, particularly inshore fishing.  There are, however, many threats to north County Dublin, its communities and these industries.  Those threats include the cost of housing and rents, the failure to extend transport links, a lack of funding and supports for communities, improper planning for and consultation in respect of offshore wind energy and an undermining of our fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  My first point to the Minister relates to the mackerel quota.  The mackerel quota is distributed nationally by ministerial policy.  This is Government, not EU, policy.  Approximately 98% of the quota is allocated to 49 larger boats.  A tiny amount of the remaining percentage is set aside for boats that are less than 18 m in length, fishing with nets that get mackerel as a by-catch.  A fixed amount of 400 tonnes is set aside for boats less than 15 m in length that fish mackerel with hooks and lines.<\/p>  <p>  The National Fisheries Inshore Forum made suggestions to the quota management advisory committee regarding this line-caught mackerel.  These suggestions were given little or no consideration by the committee, however.  Inshore fishers moved to line-caught mackerel as a way to diversify in response to the cessation of salmon drift net fishing.  From speaking to those in the industry, I am aware, however, that the catch allocations are too small, with quotas being reached in the early months of the year.  The industry sought an increase in the line-caught allocation to 3,000 tonnes annually and an increase in the landing limit from 750 kg to 1500 kg, but, as already stated, these requests ignored.  There was not even discussion regarding what was achievable, just radio silence.<\/p>  <p>  As opportunities for inshore vessels are limited, many turn to mackerel if and when they show up locally.  Unfortunately, as I have said, the 400 tonnes did not last long this year and the hook and line fishery is now closed.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why inshore fishermen are given no more help to diversify into this sustainable fishery.  Furthermore, the EU Common Fisheries Policy has done a profound injustice to some of Ireland&rsquo;s fishers.  A terrible decision was made by the Government of the day to base fish quota allocation on relative stability and established fishing practices.  This was left unchanged in the decades that followed and has allowed a situation whereby Ireland has 12% of EU waters but our fishers are only allowed to catch 4% of the fish.  This costs the State thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of euro worth of seafood every year.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, fishers were locked out of nearly all the Covid-19 supports.  Grants, wage supports and the Covid restrictions support scheme locked out fishers because they did not have rateable premises, were self-employed sole traders or self-employed share fishers and the public health restrictions did not restrict footfall to their businesses.  I know the National Inshore Fishermen&rsquo;s Association and the National Inshore Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation sent correspondence to the Minister on this, but it does not seem anything was done to support them in a meaningful way.  These are just more examples of another indigenous industry that has been failed and let down.  Maybe if our fishers painted Apple, Google or Facebook logos on the sides of their boats, they might get a little attention from this Government.<\/p>  <p>  There are other issues around planning which need to be addressed.  For instance, on maritime planning, the decision taken by the D&aacute;il will have major repercussions for the future, particularly the future of my constituency of Dublin Fingal and the seashore along the north County Dublin coast.  The marine planning Bill, which will establish a marine planning system for our maritime areas similar to that in place for land planning, is coming down the track.  What is in that legislation has to be an agreed vision constructed through engagement and conversation with planning experts, marine biologists, the fishing community and coastal communities.  To date, this has been lacking.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated last week, the marine planning framework was recently passed by this House with hardly any debate on it.  I said it then and will say it now, engagement, communication and conversation with planning experts, marine biologists, the fishing community and coastal communities is necessary because if we do not get an agreement on a broad range of fronts, mistakes in maritime and marine planning similar to those in north County Dublin, which is still dealing with the legacy of planning failures, will be made.<\/p>  <p>  There is no excuse for Deputies not to do right by our fishers and coastal communities.  The majority of counties in this State have some coastal communities and their viability, prosperity and success should be paramount to the D&aacute;il and Government.  If we fail to do our jobs properly at this stage, these communities will suffer either through intended or unintended consequences.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to anchor the issue of workers' rights within the fishing sector because it falls between several Departments and needs attention.  There are really awful work practices at play around undocumented workers and because these workers fall between Departments they can sometimes be overlooked.  I urge the Minister to engage with the International Transport Workers Federation, look at his diary, check the last time he met with its members and ensure he will meet them again soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700037#OO00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1623936900,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Barry and, possibly, Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2019, the previous Fine Gael Government, propped up by Fianna F&aacute;il, declared a climate and biodiversity emergency.

A diverse array of species inhabit our coastal and offshore waters.  There are more than 1,000 different species of marine algae, 560 species of fish, 58 species of shark, ray and chimaera - a shark nursery was discovered just a few years ago - 24 species of dolphin, two species of seal and 23 marine bird species.  There is so much there but it is all at risk. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, our marine environment is in bad health, severely degraded and in rapid decline.  It is no wonder, when the threats relating to climate action and warmer ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, raw sewage run-off and overfishing by industrial fishing fleets are considered.  The ocean is also the earth's biggest carbon sink, holding the most carbon on the planet.  Researchers recently discovered that bottom trawling, where a weighted net is dragged across the sea bed, scraping the sea floor and scooping up everything in its vicinity, releases as much carbon globally as the entire aviation industry.<\/p>  <p>  For all those reasons and many more, it is vital that, without any more delay, we begin expanding our marine protected areas.  We need to set up a marine protected area agency, which is necessary to co-ordinate what areas are designated, how they are managed and how they are actually being protected.  There needs to be real engagement with coastal communities and small fishers.  Carving out 30% of our waters and protecting them will mean less fishing, however, which undoubtedly will impact on fishers and their families.  We have to work to ensure that small fishers have full financial supports during this process into the future, have no loss of income and, in fact, have a guaranteed quality, decent income.  That is what a just transition, which the Government was not really interested in hearing yesterday, is all about.  It is about saying that the cost of taking climate action should fall on the big industrial fishers as opposed to the small fishers.<\/p>  <p>  As with nearly every environmental target ever set by this State, we have already missed the target of protecting at least 10% of our waters by 2020.<\/p> <p>Now the Government says we will go for 30% by 2030 but I find it hard to believe it will happen, considering we currently have less than 2.5% being protected in any sense.  <\/p> <p> I underscore that these marine protected areas must actually be protected from industrial and harmful human activities, as pointed out by the Irish Wildlife Trust.  We need an alliance of small fishers, environmental activists and workers everywhere to demand this sort of action happens.  We need marine protected areas that are networked and protected and we need full supports for all fishers and coastal communities that will be impacted by this.  If we continue with business as usual, the mega-trawlers will hoover up the fish, the industrial fleets will continue destroying the seabeds and we will all be left paying a significant price.<\/p> <p> I will briefly refer to conditions faced by non-EEA migrants in the fishing sector.  There is horrific exploitation of workers based in this country.  The kinds of horror stories one hears involve effective human trafficking of migrant workers into this country on boats.  They work extremely long hours in dangerous conditions, working overnight day after day, with no protection in terms of health and safety-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700037#OO00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623937500,"counter":325,"content":"<p>We are halfway through.

For many of these fishers, it comes to an end when they suffer a significant injury and are no longer able to continue.  They are then off the boat and the owner of the boat no longer cares about them.  It is an absolute scandal which continues in this country.  The International Transport Workers' Federation has done excellent work in highlighting and campaigning on this issue but we need action by the Government.  We know there are 211 boats eligible for the atypical working scheme but only 227 live permits.  That begs the question of who is crewing these boats and suggests there are large numbers of undocumented workers.  We need a census to take place now.  We need protection of workers across the industry, proper transposition of the EU directive on working time within fisheries and observation of that to make sure workers' rights in the sector are being protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700038#PP00300","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1623937500,"counter":327,"content":"<p>This debate is happening in the context of a punitive intervention by the European Commission, which has declared no confidence in the authorities of this State in the prevention of over-quota fishing.  Over the years, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has not fulfilled its responsibility in carrying out a credible number of inspections and properly pursuing cases of over-quota fishing.  As a result, the EU has imposed a collective punishment on all vessel owners who now have to have their catches de-iced and weighed at the quayside under close supervision before being refrozen and transported.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as there are compliant boat owners, particularly of smaller vessels, they have reason to feel aggrieved but there needs to be honesty in this discussion.  The International Transport Workers' Federation, in its dealings with documented and undocumented migrant fishers working on the larger vessels, reports that, where quotas species are being finished, migrant workers are routinely coerced into hiding over-quota catch from the authorities.  Forcing vulnerable workers to engage in illegal acts is one of the criteria of forced labour, according to the International Labour Organization.<\/p>  <p>  Migrants are very much part of the fishing communities we are discussing today.  We know from replies to parliamentary questions I received yesterday that, on the basis of the partial level of inspections conducted by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, over the last year, issues of non-compliance affecting migrant workers spanning over 40 vessels were uncovered.  There are currently only 227 non-EEA migrants enrolled in the atypical scheme spanning the entire eligible fleet, which is barely above one per vessel.<\/p>  <p>  We saw in the case of two Egyptians who survived a sinking in April that the Departments of Justice and Agriculture, Food and the Marine confirmed in writing that the two fishers were never enrolled in the atypical scheme.  Yet the boat owners association felt it was fine to have the non-compliant owner of that sunken vessel represent it on the national airwaves one month later, on the day of the flotilla protest in Cork. <\/p>  <p>  The statutory bodies responsible for ensuring the rights and safe working conditions of these migrants need to step it up, starting with a comprehensive crew census of eligible boats so we can establish, once and for all, who is crewing the boats and what hours they are made to work.  It will be interesting when we get proper information on that one.  It will also be interesting to find out what they are being paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700038#PP00400","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1623937500,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I must start with the recent European Commission decision that fishers must weigh their catch at the pier.  Be under no illusion that this will be, as described by local fishers, the final nail in the coffin for the fishing industry.  In County Wexford, fishers landing at Kilmore Quay bring their catch a mere 200 m from the pier to the factory to be weighed.  It is entirely counterproductive to force them to invest thousands of euro in infrastructure to weigh at the pier.  It is also costly in manpower, time and the quality of the product.  Fish must be kept at a certain temperature for freshness and value.  To demand the fish be de-iced, handled individually and then re-iced for transport to the factory is anti-fisher and ludicrous, especially when fishers and factory owners have no objections to thorough oversight by the SFPA within factories.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to start backing up the fishers now.  As matters stand, these plans are unworkable, unproductive and will force many fishers, particularly smaller boats, out of business.  The weight ruling comes on top of the already deep outrage and discontent felt in fishing and coastal communities at the bleak outcome of the Brexit EU-UK fishing negotiations.  This reduced fish quotas by a further 15%, which will cost &euro;43 million per year.  That outrage has continued and deepened as genuine fears around sustainability worsen and the lack of support continues.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month, we discussed in this Chamber the rushing through of the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2021.  One of the  concerns I had was the lack of consultation with small coastal communities and the businesses the legislation would affect.  When I talk to fishers and people in small coastal businesses, they feel completely forgotten and ignored.  Talk of decommissioning boats is antithetical to the interests of Irish fishers.  They carry proud family traditions that are not for sale at any price.  Measures must be put in place to favour the Irish fishing industry, not to bureaucratically strangle it. <\/p>  <p>  I am worried about the sustainability and viability of the indigenous scallop fishers in County Wexford.  The industry provides a livelihood for around 120 families.  UK authorities confirmed on 1 April that import requirements for direct landings of live bivalve molluscs, LBMs, including scallops, are being delayed until 1 October 2021.  The Minister has set up a seafood sector task force to deal with the many issues around Brexit, which is welcome.  Will the plight of the scallop fishers fall within the scope of the task force?  These fishers are rapidly running out of time.  They cannot be left behind as the task force conducts its work.  They are waiting to hear the fate of their livelihood and deserve to be kept up to date on any progress and on any help the Government is willing to offer.  The interim report from the task force was published yesterday.  I welcome that but the clock is ticking for Wexford scallop fishers and they are anxiously waiting to hear from the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Another example of a small coastal business being wiped out is the closure of Kilmore Seafood Limited in Wexford.  The company is to cease trading after 30 years as it is suffering significant financial losses connected to Brexit.<\/p> <p>This comes with the loss of 32 jobs.  That is 32 families that face significant economic challenges coming out of the pandemic.  This type of closure will be replicated around the country if the Government does not intervene with serious measures to address the barriers facing fishing communities.<\/p> <p> The final issue I wish to raise with the Minister is about the move to offshore wind energy generation and the potential impact on fishing and coastal communities in terms of extra journeys, distances of routes and the loss of fishing grounds.  I have raised the issue in this Chamber previously.  As I said then, renewable energy is the future, but I also believe in the principle of just transition.  I have concerns about the management of the impact of this essential infrastructure on small businesses which make their living from our waters.  They must be included in meaningful negotiations and any anticipated harms mitigated in our move to a greener world.  The concern is not just the wind farms themselves, but the imposed safety zones around them too, as they add distance by disrupting the regular routes of smaller boats.  The loss of fishing grounds cannot be overemphasised.  We want our move to renewable energy to be successful, but it must be done in a just and equitable manner for all concerned.<\/p> <p> I urge the Minister to take on board the points I have raised with him.  We must protect our fishing communities and the way to achieve this is by treating them with respect, integrity and meaningful engagement and by renegotiating the CFP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700038#PP00500","speaker":"1621","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623938100,"counter":330,"content":"<p>As a Donegal man himself, I am sure the Minister fully appreciates the importance of the sea to this island nation, but most importantly to coastal and fishing communities around the country.  I am pretty sure he also appreciates how dangerous it can be on the high seas, especially in the north Atlantic, and how many tragedies, unfortunately, have befallen the fishing communities in recent years.  Whether we are crewing a cruise ship, pleasure craft, a container ship, car ferry or fishing vessel, it is a very hazardous occupation.  If any Irish mariner is putting out to sea, he or she must have confidence that the State has the appropriate structures and services in place to help when things go wrong.<\/p><p>It is on that basis that I wish to use my time to address some issues concerning the Naval Service with the Minister.  I know, strictly speaking, it is outside his brief, but the effect of the issues come within his brief from a fisheries point of view.  I hope he can raise these matters with his Cabinet colleagues.  I wish to focus on four issues in particular.  The first is the search and rescue capability of this country.  It has been dramatically depleted in the past five years in particular.  We should have nine naval ships at sea, but we only have seven.  The reason two are at anchor in the port in Cork is that we do not have the sailors to man them.  It is an extraordinary situation to be in that we have the ships, but we do not have the crew.  We have the hard part, but we do not have the soft part.  As a result, the search and rescue capability of this country is significantly diminished, in particular in the first crucial hour when there is a tragedy at sea when everything hangs in the balance, and that prevents the Naval Service from getting to trawlers in trouble at the appropriate time.<\/p><p>The second point I wish to raise relates to the search and recovery capability.  I refer to the wonderful people in the Naval Service dive team.  When trawlers, unfortunately, go down and become submerged in a tragedy, these are the people who swim as far as 40 m below the surface and pull remains out of trawlers, bring them back up to the surface, hand them over to the grieving families ashore and give them some solace in the face of unspeakable tragedy.  There should be 30 members of the Naval Service dive team but, unfortunately, only six remain.  That has massive knock-on effects for the fishing community as well.<\/p><p>The third point I wish to raise concerns law and order.  This is a massive issue.  We are investing in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police the land mass.  That is appropriate and it is exactly how we should be doing business but, unfortunately, we are reducing the investment in how we police our territorial waters.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that there was an alleged attempted ramming of an Irish trawler only two weeks ago off the south coast.  It is not just about fishing: it is about the importation and smuggling of drugs, fugitives, people, and weapons.  There is a gap in our defences from the perspective of our territorial waters and it does affect the fishing community.<\/p><p>The fourth and final point I wish to raise specifically relates to fisheries protection.  In particular, in light of Brexit, we now have a massive third country on our doorstep with an extensive sea border.  We must be in a situation where we can prevent the night-time plundering of Irish fish stocks in Irish waters by EU and non-EU vessels that should not be here.  We must invest in the Naval Service from an inspection and patrolling perspective.<\/p><p>I would very much appreciate it if the Minister could raise those matters with his Cabinet colleagues.  The Naval Service is in crisis.  It is a man-made problem and it is therefore within our gift to solve.  Fishing and coastal communities deserve better than the <i>status quo<\/i>from a safety and security point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700039#QQ00200","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1623938100,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, is one of a number of quangos responsible for the operation and regulation of our fishing industry.  Based on what I have seen and heard in recent weeks, it may possibly be the most inaccurately named quango ever formed in this State.  From its name, one would think that its main aim was to protect the fishing industry, but if one was to describe what is happening as a result of its activities, there would be a strong case for renaming it the SFDA, the sea-fisheries destruction authority.  It seems that it is doing all it can, with the blessing of the Department, to bring about the destruction of the sea fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to highlight four important points regarding the current challenges facing the fishing industry.  On the previous occasion when I spoke on the floor of the House about fishing, judicial proceedings were being taken jointly against the SFPA and the Department.  Those proceedings were successful.  First, we must get to grips with the weighing issue and get it sorted immediately in a way that does not affect the quality of fish produce or food safety standards.  What is happening currently is not the case.  Weighing fish on a quayside where we are exposed to the elements most certainly does nothing for food standards or the safety we provide through them.  If we cannot come up with a solution within the EU guidelines, then we should ignore the guidelines and put fishing communities first rather than prioritising the wishes of the bureaucrats in Brussels.<\/p>  <p>  The second point I wish to mention is the Common Fisheries Policy.  That needs to be renegotiated ASAP.  The Government owes it to the fishing industry to do all it can to create the conditions for the industry to thrive not die.  The Minister made many concessions in order to get the EU agreement over the line on Brexit and our fishermen have been neglected.<\/p>  <p>  The third point I wish to make on the record is a local one.  It is the pier and harbour in Duncannon, which is an utter disgrace from a health and safety point of view.  Either Wexford County Council is not applying for funding or it is not being given it.  The problem must be addressed before a major accident occurs.  I urge the Minister to make this a priority and to be proactive rather than reactive when we have a disaster on our hands.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the Department recently commenced the process of closing down the fishing of mackerel due to quotas being reached.  The ban will only affect small, local, indigenous fishermen with vessels of up to 15 m.  The large, foreign factory ships are landing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish and they will be able to continue to do so.  Why is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine introducing rules and orders that are harming Irish fishing operations while rewarding and not even policing foreign fishing operations?<\/p>  <p>  I speak with fishermen on a regular basis, at least once a week and sometimes more often.  I try to bring the concerns to the attention of the Minister and the Department when I have the opportunity.  I have raised many issues with the Minister both today and on previous occasions.  Every week there seems to be another regulation or directive which adds hardship to the fishers of coastal communities.  When will it stop?  Every day there is something that diminishes what they do.  Will the Minister meet with the fishermen in Wexford to explain what is going on?  Perhaps it will not sound as complex to their ears if they hear it directly from the Minister&rsquo;s mouth and we may be able to come to some agreement.  I call on the Minister to meet with them face to face now that we are out of level 5.  Will he come to Wexford, which has a large fishing community just like his own?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700039#QQ00300","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1623938700,"counter":332,"content":"<p>It is not very long since the House dealt with farming.  The byword when it comes to farming is \"sustainable\".  I would say that is the same way we need to look at the entirety of the fishing industry.  It is all about ensuring that we have a viable, sustainable fishing industry that can deliver a plentiful supply of fish but also protection for those families engaged in fishing, many of whom have done it for many generations, and the Minister would know this better in light of the part of the world from which he comes.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say that, across Europe, we gained greatly from solidarity in regard to the Brexit issue and we hope that Europe would maintain that level of solidarity in the near future.  We obviously have difficulties in the context of the threats from Boris Johnson on the Irish protocol, but these are all problems that can be dealt with, in my view and in the view of many who would know a lot more than I.  However, we have continually seen fishers and the fishing industry taking the slack or being the fall guy.  Many in this House have referred to the Common Fisheries Policy and the fact that at the time we entered the EEC, to a degree, we got a very bad deal as regards the fishing industry.  That has not improved.  The Minister will have dealt with numerous fishers in the last while.  We now have a situation where this State has 12% of the waters in the EU but only has access to 4% of the catch.  There is a definite unfairness in this regard.  I know that when Britain left, there was going to be an element of pain, but it looks like the fishing industry in this State is going to take a huge whack, which is unfair.<\/p>  <p>  Anything that can be done from the point of view of a fairer renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy needs to be done.  We need to engage in this process as soon as possible.  Brexit funding is to be welcomed and this needs to be used from the point of view of doing whatever we need to do, whether it is capital infrastructure or whatever is necessary to lessen the blow and, beyond that, to ensure we have a viable, sustainable fishing industry.  What cannot happen is that a huge amount of this would go into a decommissioning process.  There may be fishermen who, for various reasons, that might suit but it cannot be the main focus and we cannot allow that to happen.  We need to revisit the entire process.<\/p>  <p>  I would also raise some of the worries the Minister will be aware of regarding inshore fishermen in particular the worries around the marine planning framework and all the legislation that is required to produce a complete framework in respect of how we deliver wind energy, including offshore wind energy.  We all get that this is a requirement but we need to ensure that, in dealing with this legislation, we put the correct framework in place and that we ensure all stakeholders are dealt with, particularly those inshore fishermen who are afraid of being impacted upon.  We know there are certain operations with plans for offshore wind that have engaged in consultative processes with fishers, and some of them have been quite successful, although others have not been.  We need to ensure we put best practice in place.<\/p>  <p>  We also have the territorial issues relating to Rockall, Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough, which is in my neck of the woods.  Obviously, deals were done with Britain in the pre-Brexit context but we have to take a look at all of these situations again.  The Minister has engaged to a degree with fishermen but we need to look at all fora into the future from the point of view of ensuring we have the best consultative processes in regard to Government and European decisions and the fishermen who are affected by this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700040#RR00100","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1623938700,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I am delighted that we are having this long-awaited discussion on fisheries.  I thank our leader, Deputy Mattie McGrath, for pushing the matter at the Business Committee on several occasions and eventually getting his way to have this very important debate take place at a very difficult time for Irish fisheries.  I have been pushing very hard in recent times to get more debates in the House.  In fairness, it was said earlier there are not many Deputies here but everybody took up their slots, bar Labour.  In fairness, there is a bit of interest out there in regard to fishing, which is very important, but there needs to be a further and stronger focus, and this is not where we have had our focus recently.<\/p>  <p>  I pushed recently on the Order of Business to discuss the near-ramming incident in the waters off Castletownbere by a Spanish trawler three times the size of an Irish trawler, and I was voted down.  It went up on social media that it was raised by a Deputy from west Cork and that this was the wrong way to do business.  I do not care how we get to debate fishing in this House as long as we debate it - and do so continuously - and iron out the crisis that is there.  I make no apology to any Deputy, to the Minister or to the Taoiseach for raising these issues.  The Taoiseach is furious with me, so much so that he tried to mislead the D&aacute;il last week and on several other occasions, which is an issue that is being dealt with through the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office.  I make no apology for putting the fishermen first at every opportunity.  If the Business Committee is run by the Government because it has more numbers on it and will not allow the time, I will bring the matter to the House on the Order of Business.  I will push these Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies to either press the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; button or the &ldquo;No&rdquo; button and we will see how the fishermen react.<\/p>  <p>  I go back over the performance of the past 12 months.  Many of the issues that led to the crisis we are in today date from before the Minister's time.  I want to make sure that it is not me versus the Minister in any shape or form.  I am furious that successive Governments - not the Minister, Deputy McConalogue - have left Irish fishermen to hang out to dry.  Unfortunately, the Minister has been left to deal with a complete mess that is the legacy of other Ministers.  The whole reason fisheries is at the bottom of the barrel in this country is because we are afraid to mention it and our Governments are afraid to fight the corner of ordinary Irish fishermen.<\/p>  <p>  In the negotiations for Government in which I was involved in 2016, I brought up the idea of a senior Minister for fisheries.  In 2020, I was involved in discussions with Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin, Varadkar and Eamon Ryan.  Bantry Hospital was also a very important issue for me but this was the other red-liner, and I said they would not get my support unless there was a senior Minister for fisheries.  They refused me point-blank and now we have the complete evidence of their inaction and the way they let this country down and left fishermen in tatters.<\/p>  <p>  To look at the performance in the past 12 months under the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, we have had five Ministers with responsibility for dealing with these issues.  When the Deputy took over as Taoiseach, what was the first thing he did in those early weeks?  He signed into place the completely flawed penalty points system that has proven to be a terrible infliction on Irish fishermen, when he should have stood up for them and refused to sign until the issues that had to be rectified were rectified.  He did not do so.  Then, we had a Brexit deal that we failed to negotiate.  I pleaded in the House with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the Taoiseach to go in and fight for our rights.  Irish Ministers should be negotiating in there, not Michel Barnier.  Michel Barnier did a deal but he did not do a deal for the Irish.  Mr Barnier did a deal for France and every other country.  Ireland was hung out to dry because we had no negotiator at the table at a very crucial time.<\/p>  <p>  We have gone from one crisis to another crisis in the past 12 months.<\/p> <p>Everybody is asking questions about the weighing crisis here.  Nobody has answered any about the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  It is an authority of its own.  It misled us in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I was there.  The Minister told me afterwards that he and the SFPA knew there was a weighing crisis in December.  Why was the fishing industry not informed of that crisis until 5 p.m. on 16 April 2021?  Representatives of the SFPA had told the committee the authority worked well with the industry.  It did not work with the industry and did not tell the industry about the crisis.  The SFPA could have been working towards a solution from December until April but nothing was done and now we have a crisis.  It is shocking.<\/p> <p> We have found out that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the SFPA have made an agreement that French and Belgian vessels can land fish straight into the back of lorries in Irish ports.  Their catches do not have to be sampled, weighed or checked.  This is astonishing.  Why are we giving more rights to foreign vessels than to Irish vessels?  Imagine an Irish fisherman being pushed and tugged with every rule coming down on top of him and this impossible weighing situation.  He can see a Spanish trawler park up and they are laughing at us as they fill their lorries without any weighing being done.  Does the Minister know what quotas these foreign vessels are bringing in?  Does he know the amount of Irish fish on these boats?  Does he have any idea what they are doing?  They are coming straight in and the boats are not searched to see what catch they have.  There is no weighing and there are no problems.  They are told to drive on because they have rights but the Irishman has no rights in his own waters.<\/p> <p> I do not have much time but I could speak for an hour on these issues.  I raised the near-ramming incident involving a Spanish trawler that is three times the size of a Castletownbere trawler.  There are many questions about this and I want a special meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine held to resolve it.  The SFPA leaves much to be desired.  The Naval Service was not able to attend to the incident, through no fault of its own, because it is probably underresourced.  I cannot understand why no protection was provided to Irish fishermen on the day in question.  It took 12 hours to get out to the location.  Imagine what would have happened if the vessel had been rammed.  Well done to the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation for the peaceful protest in Cork recently and to those involved in the protests in Ringsend.

That is all he ever asked for.<\/p>  <p>  Irish fishermen understandably resent the EU requirement, facilitated by the Irish Government and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, for catches to be weighed at ports.  They have to take the fish out of ice.  It is unbelievable.  We lost badly in 1973 when we joined the EU.  There has been a total sell-out this time.  Like Deputy Collins, I am not blaming the Minister because he is new and there were three or four Ministers before him in a short time.  We took our eye off the ball and got a bad deal, under which we can only catch 16% of the fish in our own waters.  Spanish and French trawlers can come in to our ports and they do not have to weigh their catches.  They can bring them back to where they want to process them, as we used to do.  This new weighing rule is tyranny.  The Minister has run away with himself since Covid.  He thinks he can do what he likes and he has got away with very little scrutiny here.  I am astounded that Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and some Independent backbenchers, especially from coastal counties, will not stand up to represent their people as they are elected to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700041#SS00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1623939300,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Much has happened to fishing communities recently, with very little debate about it in this House.  That says a lot about how these communities are thought of in this House.  We had the shambles of the Brexit negotiations and the complete lack of attention the Government paid to fisheries.  There has been the fiasco of the weighing investigation court case and the impact it has had on fishing, both pelagic and demersal.  There is the ongoing treatment of foreign workers in our fishing fleet, which is a serious employment and human rights issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Department, Minister and Government showed a complete lack of interest in what was happening with Brexit, to the extent that they have allowed other EU nations, supposedly our partners, to reap the best of a bad deal.  We have been left with the worst of that deal.  Sadly, our Minister shows no interest in belatedly trying to deal with the issue.  When the deal was being made, the Department did not even know which Irish vessels were fishing in English waters, despite this being discussed for three years in advance of the deal.<\/p>  <p>  The fiasco of the weighing system, including how it has been dealt with by the Department and the SFPA, is telling.  Rather than deal with supposed wrongdoers, why do the SFPA and the Department damn the entire industry?  Surely the right approach would be to deal with the problems and let everyone else continue to work?  We have the crazy situation where the pelagic fishing industry had to take a judicial review to get a fair hearing about its solution to the problem because the SFPA would not or could not make a decision.  We must consider the judicial review in the context of the SPFA's recent statement to the joint committee that it consults the industry on all matters at all times.  I beg to differ.  The record shows that this statement is an untruth.  I use that word because apparently Members cannot say in the House that it is a lie.<\/p>  <p>  We continue to be left with this treatment of the white fish fleet and the weighing disaster.  Let us take how monkfish are treated when landed in order to get an accurate weight.  If the ice is not removed fully, its weight will taken with the weight of the fish and the boat will lose out.  It seems the fishermen do not really matter.  That is certainly how they feel and I do not disagree with them.<\/p>  <p>  If the SFPA has a job to do, why can it not work with the fishermen to achieve its aim?  There appears to be an attitude that fishermen are all out to cheat the system and the SFPA will, therefore, behave that way too.  The problem is that the fishermen have always been outdone by the system.  The root of all these problems can be found in our negotiations to join the European Economic Community, as it was then.  According to Garret FitzGerald, the EEC never again treated us as badly as it did with regard to fishing rights on our accession to the EEC.  It cannot be said often enough that it did not have to treat us as badly again.  We became net contributors to the EEC on the day we joined.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, we also have to discuss and acknowledge how fishermen have been treated.  It is a great shame of the fishing industry that foreign fishermen have been maltreated across the sector.  It should not happen.  Sadly, when we look at how Irish fishermen were treated in the past, it is hardly surprising.  All fishermen and workers should be treated with respect and offered proper pay and conditions.  That is the least that any worker deserves.  It is when our fishing communities can look to the Government to support them and help them to grow that we will see rural Ireland grow and survive.  If communities could expect official support and proportionate rules, we would have an industry that supports everyone in rural Ireland.  That is not too much for anyone to ask and it is all that fishermen are asking for at this stage.  The Minister would do well to listen to them and get the Department and SFPA on board and working with rather than against them.  Unfortunately, that is how things are in the industry and it is the root of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  The root of the problem lies in our accession to the EU and what happened at that time.  Unless the Government goes to Europe and actively deals with that issue through negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy next year, the problem will, unfortunately, continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700041#SS00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1623939300,"counter":337,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo in ainneoin srianta ama.

I wish to make points on islands, seaweed and smaller fishermen.  It is ironic that we are talking about fishermen today, on the day the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine announced that no more mackerel can be caught.  How can the Minister say that is just?  We are only in June and no more mackerel can be caught.  Of course, this disproportionately affects the smaller boats.  One problem is the quota and, as my colleague said, the sell-out.  In addition, even the limited quota we have has been utterly mismanaged.  The smallest boats are being penalised and now they are not allowed to catch any more mackerel.  <\/p> <p>More than three years ago on 8 March 2018, the majority of the D&aacute;il - that was some achievement - accepted a motion that I and my colleagues tabled on sustainable seaweed harvesting agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; feamainne agus an g&aacute; pr&aacute;inneach le polasa&iacute; &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; feamainne de.  We are now in 2021 and there is no sign of a policy or a strategy.  This is a wonderful asset - no more than our waters and oceans, no more than quotas for fishing, which are public assets which should be used for the maximum public gain.  It is more than three years later and we still have no policy on seaweed.  <\/p> <p> Our islands are an example to us in sustainable living.  If we were cliste go leor, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfaimis &eacute;isteacht leo agus ceacht foghlamtha a bheith againne maidir leis an mbealach is fearr le dul anois chun dul i ngleic le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; aer&aacute;ide agus paind&eacute;ime.  If we had any sense, we would realise that the solution lies before our noses through sustainable development in our community areas and having the people on board with us.  Instead of that, we are pursuing policies that are segmented and guaranteed to divide and conquer.  I am absolutely committed to action on climate change.  I voted for the Bill yesterday.  While I was not happy with it, I realised it was all we were going to get at this point.<\/p> <p> However, we are pushing ahead with a policy that is not encouraging people to work with us on climate change.  We are pushing renewable development, which I fully support, but not in a manner that is sustainable.  For instance, in Connemara there is uproar over the manner in which windmills are being proposed.  I will find myself in an extremely difficult position.  We want public involvement, public return and public ownership.  That is what we need in all our communities.<\/p> <p> Through the pandemic we learned that globalisation is not good for people.  It is not good for business because we have had to bail all the businesses out.  Most importantly it is not good for the planet.  Therefore, if we are talking about transformative action, we need to do it in a way that is meaningful.  What better way to start than with the small fishermen?  A renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy is coming up.  In the first instance, we must acknowledge that wrong was done and then try to get a much better deal, with the realisation that a quota is a public asset for all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700041#SS00400","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623939900,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  We have had a very constructive and useful debate.  I am very glad we have had three hours to discuss marine issues.  As Deputies will be aware, it has been my hallmark as Minister to engage in every way I can with fishers.  I have held virtual town hall meetings with people from coastal communities throughout the country in the absence of being able to meet people during the pandemic.  I intend to visit our piers and harbours over the summer when hopefully it will be possible to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I have had many engagements with Deputies at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine.  I am open at any time to attend that committee to discuss the matter further.  Likewise, I am open to having a discussion in this Chamber at any time on marine matters.  I have had substantial ongoing engagement with producer organisation representatives and fisher representatives on all issues and will continue to do that.  If anybody needs any more debate at any stage, they should just ask and I will be available.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins spoke about seeking a debate and raising the issue here in the House one day.  I am always available to meet and there are ways and means for people to make requests.  A hurler does not land in the middle of a football pitch looking to play hurling and then give out about the referee putting him off the pitch, which was what happened when the Deputy requested the debate that day.  He raised it during an entirely different debate and was told by the Ceann Comhairle that it was not appropriate on that point.  I know he disputed it at the time but that was why there was a kerfuffle that day.  It related to the forum in which it was requested.  At any stage when a debate is required, I am open to it.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from today's debate that it is not always as simple as looking to press a \"Yes\" or \"No\" button on issues relating to fishermen.  There are many technical difficult issues involved which require much engagement and consideration in the Oireachtas, including at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine, and directly with fishermen and fisherwomen.  We have had many challenges to deal with recently, including Brexit which is a once-in-a-generation challenge to the sector, the weighing issue which is presenting a real challenge at the moment and ongoing challenges relating to quota.  Those matters require considerable engagement and I am always open for that.  It is not as straightforward as looking to create a set-piece and push a \"Yes\" or \"No\" button.<\/p>  <p>  Some Deputies have suggested that we need a dedicated full Cabinet Minister for the marine.  However, I am a full Cabinet Minister for the marine in the same way as in the full Cabinet Minister for agriculture.  I am Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The same applies to food.  I have never been told that we need a dedicated Minister for agriculture because I also cover food and the marine.  The same logic applies to being a full Cabinet Minister, fully representing the marine as well.<\/p>  <p>  Even though it is a smaller sector in its proportion of the national economy, accounting for about one tenth of the exports that agriculture does, it is a very important sector of the economy, nonetheless.  It is very important to our national identity.  It takes up much more of my time than that, given the challenges facing our marine and fishing sector.  I am honoured to be able to work with everyone and to represent it as best I can, working with my Government colleagues as a full Cabinet Minister in the same way as I am a full Cabinet Minister for agriculture.  It is really important that a full Cabinet Minister has that responsibility.  That is the best way to ensure the sector is represented at Cabinet level and at European level on the Council of Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  I touched on many topics in my opening address.<\/p> <p>In my closing remarks, I will touch on a few other points, many of which were made during this debate.  It is also important to discuss the topic of climate action in the seafood sector, particularly in light of the passing last night of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill.  There is growing global acceptance of the reality of the impacts of climate change on our oceans.  This has driven a sharp focus on the need for solutions and actions to address these pressing challenges.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has signalled his intention to publish the climate action plan 2021 this summer.  My Department is participating in several working groups contributing to the drafting of the plan.  As I speak, climate action is actively being embedded across policies, programmes and work streams within my Department and the agencies under my remit, creating opportunities for innovation and to harness the collective input of policymakers, scientists, technical experts and industry representatives to generate meaningful climate action.<br\/><br\/>As islanders surrounded by ocean, it is imperative that we further and deepen our understanding of the marine environment and the effects of climate change.  During 2021, the Marine Institute will conduct a baseline study of essential ocean variable monitoring in Irish waters, current measurement programmes and data quality.  We also have the new marine research vessel, <i>RV Tom Crean<\/i>, which is due to be completed in summer 2022.  I was pleased last week to be at the pier in Greencastle, in my home county, to announce that over 600 tonnes of mainly plastic waste has been collected by our seafood sector since 2015 as part of the clean oceans initiative.  I congratulate all the fishers who were involved and Bord Iascaigh Mhara for its initiative.<br\/><br\/>Withe regard to the national marine planning framework, all maritime spatial planning matters, including for offshore renewable energy projects, come under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I understand the Minister intends to publish the maritime area planning Bill in the coming weeks, which will overhaul the planning and development system in the maritime area.  The national marine planning framework is due to be published next month.  <br\/><br\/>I will briefly address the issue of fisheries control, which was raised by a number of Deputies.  I am very much aware of the recent decision by the European Commission, which has significant implications for our fishers, to remove Ireland's derogation for weighing of fish after transport.  As Deputies will know, I have addressed this issue in the House many times.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has put a revised fisheries control plan out to public consultation.  Following the conclusion of that public consultation, the SFPA will submit a new control plan to the EU for approval.<br\/><br\/>On the situation post Brexit, the interim report of the task force, to which several Deputies referred, was presented to me in recent days.  The report accurately describes Brexit as a once in a generation geopolitical shift.  That is a fair reflection of the challenge and impact Brexit has had.  Overall, we will see a 15% impact on our national fishing quotas, between now and 2026.  That is causing significant distress to our sector and all the fishers who are impacted by that loss.  I will continue to explore all opportunities to address this burden placed that has been on us and which exceeds the burden many other member states are carrying.  We will be informed by the advice from the fisheries task force, under the chairmanship by Aidan Cotter, on the avenues and methods for best doing that.  We will be guided by further reports of the task force.  I look forward to the task force bringing to a conclusion its work on how we can support and invest in our fisheries sector in the years ahead.<br\/><br\/>I know we have had challenges in recent months but I fully believe the fishing sector has a tremendous and sustainable future.  It is a sector I want to ensure we invest in to maximise its potential to sustain incomes throughout the country, address the challenges it faces and build it to become as important a sector in our future as it has been in our past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700042#TT00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623940500,"counter":341,"content":"<p>On a point of order, the Minister, in my view, misled the House in saying I was trying to create a set piece and that I was a hurler on the field.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700043#UU00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1623940500,"counter":342,"content":"<p>That is not a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700043#UU00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1623940500,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I am entitled under Standing Orders to seek a debate at any time.

As an island nation, Ireland is particularly dependent on air connectivity, both socially and economically, and we all know that international travel and regional connectivity, which is facilitated by our regional airports, is vital for the economic well-being of the regions served.  Government policy on regional airports seeks to optimise conditions for regional development and connectivity for both social and economic benefits.  The Government recognises that, as employers, airports contribute to the local economy and employment is also supported through the various ancillary services that are provided to the airports.  However, we are all too aware of the impact Covid-19, coupled with the emergence and spread of variants of concern, have had on international travel.<\/p>  <p>  Globally, aviation is experiencing the most challenging crisis in its history, with European flights reducing from more than 11 million in 2019 to 5 million in 2020.  Restrictions on international travel to date have further suppressed passenger numbers.  Passenger air travel revenues have fallen to a fraction of 2019 levels.  Scheduled carrier flights were down by approximately 60% and at year's end more than 4,000 aircraft, which represents half of the European aircraft fleet, were grounded.  A similar number of flights across Europe is forecast for 2021 in a base case scenario.  However, Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, has indicated that if more states relax their restrictions sooner and fully implement procedures, such as the EU's digital Covid certificate, as soon as possible, its forecast optimistic scenario could see the network handling 69% of 2019 traffic levels in August.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the general reduction in passenger numbers has severely impacted the aviation industry.  This has led to companies, both in Ireland and in a wider European context, taking action to rationalise their cost base, including redundancies and staff reduction measures, as well as taking steps to safeguard liquidity through borrowing and new shareholder capital.  I deeply regret the most recent announcement of the loss of 480 jobs as a result of the entry into voluntary liquidation of Stobart Air over the weekend.  This came further to the announcement by Aer Lingus of the closure of its base at Shannon recently.  I acknowledge the devastating impact of these announcements on all the staff involved and to all those in the aviation industry who continue to be impacted by the most sustained and deepest period of suppression this sector has ever faced.<\/p>  <p>  Job cuts have unfortunately been a feature of other European airlines, including the loss of 24,000 jobs at Lufthansa, 10,000 jobs at lAG, 5,000 jobs at KLM, with further job losses signalled in industry-wide restructuring as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.  These job losses have arisen even with the provision of substantial state supports and are indicative of the scale of the crisis in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, Stobart Air's plans to secure a new buyer failed over the weekend and this action resulted in Stobart Air commencing a process of voluntary liquidation.  This resulted in Stobart Air's franchise agreement with Aer Lingus being terminated with immediate effect.<\/p> <p> I assure the House that the restoration of regional connectivity is a critical priority for the Government.  The market has already moved to replace some of the lost routes, with Aer Lingus and BA CityFlyer now operating temporary replacement services which will cover most of the affected routes operating out of Dublin Airport and Belfast City Airport.  Together with routing options, this will allow passengers impacted by the situation to return home.<\/p> <p> The termination of the franchise agreement with Aer Lingus also had immediate implications for both of our Government PSO-supported air services operated by Stobart Air on two routes between Dublin Airport and Donegal and Kerry airports.  I am, however, happy to advise that work is under way in my Department to launch an emergency procurement process with a view to restoring air services on these vital regional routes as quickly as possible in the coming weeks.  I fully understand the importance of having these services in place by 19 July, when international travel is to return.  My Department plans to issue a request for quotes directly to airlines in the coming days in accordance with applicable EU rules on air service PSOs.  It is anticipated that this accelerated procurement process will be completed by early July with a view to services recommencing under the new operator or operators as soon as possible thereafter.  The new contract will be subject to a maximum term of seven months and will operate in accordance with EU law.  To mitigate against any further disruption to these services, my Department will also launch a procurement process for the continued provision of the services for a maximum of four years.  This will apply after the temporary contract has expired.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I will continue to engage closely with aviation stakeholders, including representatives of the airports in Kerry and Donegal, to keep them informed of plans in this regard.  I am happy to advise Deputies that a number of airlines have already been in contact to indicate their interest in operating these routes.<\/p> <p> The Government is fully cognisant of the ongoing and deep impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector and has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including those in the aviation sector.  These supports are unprecedented and include the wage subsidy scheme, the waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund.  This is also being availed of.  Taking all of these supports into account, it is estimated that more than &euro;450 million will have been made available to the sector by the end of June.  I acknowledge the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of the employment supports beyond the end of June.  Airlines have been reassured that there will be no cliff edge in the horizontal State supports that have been available from the start of the pandemic.<\/p> <p> The Government has also allocated funding of &euro;80 million for an aviation-specific support package in 2021.  This represents a quadrupling of the funding provided to our regional airports and in support of our PSO services for Donegal and Kerry in a normal year.  Some &euro;21 million of this funding is being provided to our smaller regional airports at Donegal, Knock and Kerry under the new regional airports programme for the period 2021-2025.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, in acknowledgement of the severe impacts on our two State regional airports and in recognition of the importance of these airports in the south-west and mid-west regions which they serve, an unprecedented &euro;32 million is being made available to support the airports at Cork and Shannon this year.  This level of funding to our State airports is unprecedented as Ireland's State airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon operate under a commercial mandate and, ordinarily, do not benefit from Exchequer support.<\/p> <p> In recognition of the impact of Covid-19 on all our airports, schemes that are compliant with state aid rules have also been developed following extensive engagement with the European Commission by my Department.  Under these schemes, a further allocation of up to &euro;6 million is available to the airports at Donegal, Kerry and Knock.  These schemes also include &euro;20 million in compensation for the State airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  This funding will provide State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives and charge rebates in consultation with airlines with a view to supporting the recovery and growth of connectivity.  My Department is currently assessing applications for this funding and hopes to be in a position to disburse this compensation in the coming weeks.  Additional funding that might be necessary for our regional State airports at Cork and Shannon will be considered in the context of the Estimates process this year in respect of budget 2022.  Government fully accepts and is willing to keep under review any additional supports in this sector, if required.  Deputies will be aware that the economic recovery plan published by Government on 1 June explicitly references this and recognises that additional supports may be required to support the aviation sector's recovery as it opens up.<\/p> <p> The regional airports programme published by Government in February provides certainty for the airports that deliver connectivity to the regions for the next four years.  Donegal Airport, Kerry Airport and Ireland West Airport, Knock, are eligible for funding under this programme.  In addition to targeting the funding of safety and security projects and activities, the scope of the new programme has been expanded to encourage airports to reduce emissions and build climate resilience.  The programme honours commitments in the programme for Government, which recognises the value of aviation to economic development, international connectivity and tourism, to deliver funding that will support services and ensure safety at our regional airports.  All eligible capital projects submitted for funding by our regional airports were approved this year.  Some &euro;2 million in grant funding has been made available to deliver runway upgrade works and a new fire training centre in Knock.  More than &euro;1.7 million in funding has been provided to Kerry Airport to deliver replacement vehicles and CCTV upgrade works.  Almost &euro;900,000 in funding has been provided to Donegal Airport to fund a new fire truck and other projects including runway lighting.<\/p> <p> Projects supported under the &euro;32 million regional State airports programme, to which I referred earlier, include a runway overlay project at Cork Airport.  This is currently being assessed but, given the costs involved, this project is subject to appraisal under the public spending code.  Pending a satisfactory evaluation, I hope to be in a position to formally approve funding of &euro;10 million for this project in the coming weeks.  The funding that Government will provide to Cork Airport has allowed this project to be brought forward to this year.  This is a vital and strategic project for Cork Airport and the management of the airport aims to complete the project within ten weeks, taking the opportunity to complete it while passenger numbers are suppressed so the airport can be ready to operate in an unconstrained manner once it reopens on completion of the works at the end of November.  Projects costing more than &euro;6 million are also being supported at Shannon Airport this year.  These include an airfield rehabilitation project and upgrades to security scanners and security screening.  This funding is being provided in addition to &euro;6 million in funding allocated to Shannon Airport for a hold baggage screening project last year.  Both of these airports will also benefit from operational funding of &euro;15.6 million this year.<\/p> <p> I assure Deputies that the Government is committed to continuing to support this sector.  The Minister and I have engaged extensively with all aviation stakeholders, including through the aviation recovery task force, the National Civil Aviation Development Forum and the aviation subgroup of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, which I chair.  It is clear from this engagement that the single most important factor for Irish aviation is the earliest and widest reopening of international travel possible, subject to public health considerations.<\/p> <p> The main requirement of all aviation stakeholders has been clarity on a plan to permit the resumption of non-essential international air travel.  This has now been addressed with the Government announcement on 26 May of a roadmap for the gradual reopening of international travel on 19 July.  The current advice to avoid non-essential travel and related penalties will remain in place until 18 July.  However, from 19 July, citizens will be advised to travel safely and in accordance with public health guidance and restrictions and to avoid non-essential travel to countries in which an emergency brake has been applied.  From 19 July, we will also operate the EU digital Covid certificate for travel originating within the EU or the EEA.  This certificate will show if a passenger is vaccinated against Covid-19, has recovered from Covid-19 or has a negative test result.  All passengers will be advised to observe public health restrictions and to present for post-arrival testing if they develop symptoms.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, from 19 July Ireland will also broadly align itself to the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from third countries outside the EU or the EEA.  To protect its citizens against the importation of variants, an emergency brake mechanism will be co-ordinated at EU level to react swiftly to the emergence of a variant of concern or variant of interest.  It is important to point out that, with regard to third countries such as the US and UK, strict travel restrictions remain in place.  The US, for example, continues to limit entry for non-essential travel.  For travellers entering the UK from outside the common travel area from countries on the green list, a negative test is required, carried out up to 72 hours in advance of travel, with a further requirement for a test up to two days following arrival.<\/p> <p>For travellers from countries on the UK's amber or red lists, there is a requirement to quarantine and take two Covid tests.  Mandatory hotel quarantine applies for those arriving from red-listed countries.  These requirements apply to all those entering the UK from outside the common travel area, even those who have been vaccinated.<\/p> <p> I and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, along with my departmental officials, will continue to engage at every level across Government to ensure that all options relating to testing which strike the right balance between protecting public health and protecting our economy are considered.  That same balance applies to aviation and maritime transport.<\/p> <p> I highlight that during the normal regular engagements at interdepartmental level, including with the CMO, the Department of Health and the HSE, my Department has consistently highlighted the need to reopen international travel as soon as possible in a manner that continues to protect public health.  The possible use of antigen testing for the purpose of reopening international travel has been suggested by my Department on several occasions.  I most recently raised this issue in the context of correspondence to senior Ministers on 11 May to set out a number of issues that required urgent clarification in the context of the Government's consideration of the aviation restart plan.  This included consideration of antigen testing to replace PCR tests for international travel, perhaps on a pilot basis initially.  However, to date, the public health advice, which is based on World Health Organization advice, has been that the use of antigen testing is not suitable for the purposes of supporting international travel.  The advice has been that while antigen testing may play a role as an added screening measure in some settings, such as the workplace, it is not considered appropriate for international travel.  I note the comments made by the CMO yesterday and will continue to be guided by the Department of Health and NPHET with regard to testing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700043#UU00900","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623941700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that the House has made time for statements on international travel but it is more than statements that we need.  We have had statements on the matter on several occasions, not least in recent weeks.  There are many people interested in this sector.  More than 140,000 people across the State are dependent on it, directly or indirectly, and to a man and to a woman they are very anxious for the Government to outline and present a plan and, in the meantime, for it to provide supports for the sector and the workers in it.<\/p>  <p>  There have been many criticisms made of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, as a result of his hands-off approach.  I am disappointed that he is not available today to address this really important issue.  I note that there is a proposal for another task force in respect of Shannon, for example.  There is almost a pattern in terms of the response.  It is important to note that although 19 July is in our sights, everything will not just fall back into place when travel reopens on that date.  In fact, airports, airlines and aviation workers will face a significant uphill challenge in the coming months as travel resumes and they will need continuing support.<\/p>  <p>  The transport committee has spent recent days discussing in detail the merits of antigen testing.  I raised the issue again with the Minister this morning on Oral Questions.  It is clear there was an attempt by some members of Government parties to lay the blame for all this at the feet of NPHET but the evidence of the CMO to the transport committee yesterday highlighted that the Department of Transport simply has not pursued this avenue aggressively.  The CMO clearly stated yesterday to the committee that there is no evidence base for introducing antigen testing for international travel.  I and other members of the committee pointed to several reports but none of the reports dealt with the area of international travel specifically.  We can argue the merits of taking lessons from one report and trying one's best to implement a scheme but what I heard clearly was that no pilot studies were pursued.  I do not think it is sufficient for the Department or the Ministers to have raised the prospect of antigen testing only to be told it is not advised or it is advised against.  The whole point was to generate in a risk-free way a pilot study within the current constraints to assess the effectiveness or usefulness of antigen testing.  If that were done, then at least we would know whether it would be effective rather than having to speculate in that regard and we could generate our own evidence base.  To say that the issue was raised in the middle of May but the Department was told the advice was different is not satisfactory.  In fact, an aggressive approach could have been taken far earlier.<\/p>  <p>  It is quite likely that antigen testing would not be the be all and end all.  All Members recognise that Covid is a real challenge and that we have to follow the public health advice at all times, but what is at stake here is that the Government is being asked to try to strike the best balance.  It may be the case that no better balance can be found than the one with which we had to live, but the argument is that there were opportunities to do more but they were not taken.<\/p>  <p>  On a related point, I discussed previously with the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and heard discussed this morning the prohibitive cost of PCR testing, particularly for children who may be travelling with parents after 19 July.  There is a question mark regarding how that will be dealt with.  This morning the Minister, Deputy Ryan, stated that it will be considered.  We should also consider the possibility of antigen testing.  There is a real argument to be made in terms the most cost-efficient way to do things in the context of the taxpayer, but we must also be mindful of the public health advice in this regard.  That said, there is still merit to pursuing pilot antigen tests.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the digital Covid certificate, DCC, I hope the Ministers can provide more clarity regarding the introduction of the DCC, how it will work here and what criteria will apply.  Many people will want to know that information as quickly as possible.  It is to be hoped that a large number of people will be vaccinated in the near future.  What role will PCR testing play?  What criteria will apply in respect of various countries, particularly for those coming back into Ireland?  Will there be a role for antigen testing?  Many people are keenly interested in that issue.  There is a host of questions to be asked.  When will people be able to apply for the certificate?  How long will it take to process?  How will it work for those arriving in Ireland?  Will the system work with those of non-EU countries such as the USA and Canada?  There is still a lack of detail around this critical tool for safe international travel.  I encourage the Minister and the Government to provide as much information as possible as early as possible on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  What is the status of the aviation recovery task force report with which we have lived since last July?  It was prepared and published last summer but few of its recommendations have been implemented.  Why have the recommendations not been implemented?  Will recommendation No. 5, which relates to the rebate of airport and air navigation charges relating to Dublin Airport, be introduced?  On recommendation No. 6, which proposes a common fixed sum per passenger for Cork, Shannon, Ireland West, Kerry and Donegal airports, is there a plan for such a scheme to be introduced for these airports or has the Government combined these recommendations in the &euro;26 million package approved by the European Commission earlier this year?  If that is the case, I fear the Government has greatly underestimated the scale of support needed by the sector.  I ask that clarity be provided regarding the exact source and scale of funding for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to a group of workers in an industry directly related to the travel industry, namely, travel agents.<\/p> <p>Theirs was one of the first industries to close and will likely be one of the last to reopen fully.  Travel agents feel they have been overlooked in most recent Covid support announcements, notwithstanding the ongoing assistance provided under the employment wage subsidy scheme, which will begin to be phased out from September.  Taking travel agents off the Covid restrictions support scheme now will result in the cliff edge the Government promised to avoid.  The business resumption support scheme is capped at three weeks but the lack of revenue for the industry will continue for at least six months.  I ask the Minister of State to address this massive issue facing travel agents.<\/p> <p> I will conclude by referring to Stobart Air.  My colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, and I met worker representatives from the airline this morning.  Having worked for years for the company, they were devastated by what has happened.  The way they were informed of the liquidation, in the middle of the night, was completely unfair.  They have been left in an information vacuum.  The liquidators contacted them in the past 24 hours and they were given a frequently asked questions document.  That is the height of it.  They have really important questions to ask about redundancy and social welfare entitlements.  Some people, in pursuit of work with the company, moved from being based in Dublin to being based in Belfast, as a result of which there is a question mark over their social welfare entitlements.  Will the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, engage with this group of workers and help them in every way they can?  They have had a really tough 15 months and the way they have been treated in recent days is completely unacceptable.  They need every support that is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700045#WW00200","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623942300,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I echo the call by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, to support the workers at Stobart Air.  There has been much bad news relating to the aviation sector during the pandemic, including that of cabin crew losing their jobs in Shannon and ground staff losing their jobs in various locations.  Those job losses did not happen in huge numbers but in consistent, small numbers that may not have made the national headlines.  By God, they made the headlines in the communities I represent and they have had a huge impact on those affected and their families.  The sheer number and scale of the Stobart Air job losses has sent a real shock wave through every other aviation company operating in this State.  There is a feeling that the gates have opened and everything that has been threatening for the past year and more is now coming to pass.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, in fairness, gave a detailed opening statement in which she mentioned a large number of capital projects.  It is quite incongruous that in Dublin Airport, for example, construction work is continuing on the huge additional runway project and on new buildings that are part of the expansion of the airport, while, at the same time, the sword of Damocles is hanging over workers of every grade there and in airports throughout the country.  What is really going on?  Is there an agenda on the part of aviation companies to use the pandemic to change their terms and conditions of employment, get rid of employees on good contracts and replace them with workers on yellow-pack contracts?  We have to start asking that question.<\/p>  <p>  There is money going into capital projects in the aviation industry but jobs are not being protected, which is the key concern.  Retaining the jobs and experience of the people working in the industry must be the priority.  Everything else comes after that.  We have been banging our heads against a brick wall talking about job protection being above all else.  Yes, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, has helped.  There is no doubt that supports have been put in place that have helped.  However, jobs are being lost now.  What has happened to the Stobart Air workers and the Aer Lingus cabin crew in Shannon shows that jobs are being lost in huge numbers.  Unfortunately, there is no confidence among aviation workers that there is a level of engagement between the Government and the aviation companies to protect jobs.  There is Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, funding but that has to be drawn structurally, it is commercial and all of that.  It is not cutting through to the workers simply to say that, come 19 July and the months following it as, we hope, aviation takes off safely, their jobs will still be there.  People have less confidence in that outcome now than they did a year ago.  That is the concern.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about antigen testing, which has been discussed a great deal this week.  No one is saying antigen testing is a silver bullet.  We on this side of the House are not saying that and nor are people in the industry.  This issue is getting a lot of attention this week because the argument has been on whether antigen testing can be part of the solution.  Many eminent medical scientists and professionals believe it can be part of a solution that would include PCR testing and all the other measures to which we have become accustomed.  The Minister of State mentioned in her statement that her Department has engaged on several occasions with senior Ministers.  Correspondence dated 11 May set out a number of issues, including a consideration of whether antigen testing should replace RT-PCR testing for international travel, initially on a pilot basis.  That is concerning because nobody has asked that antigen testing replace PCR testing.  The call is that they be used in concert.  PCR testing could be used for passengers on the way out but we may need antigen tests for people on the way in.  We are asking that antigen testing be put on top of the existing structure, to make it a bit more flexible where it can, but without in any way weakening what we already have.<\/p>  <p>  I have real concerns that the right questions are not being asked on this issue, including by the Minister of State's Department to the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  We had a clear statement from NPHET yesterday, following questions I raised, stating that it had not heard from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  This morning during Question Time, the Minister said he has written to NPHET to ask that antigen testing be trialled for aviation.  He said that this morning.  The Minister of State has indicated in her statement this afternoon that she has written to NPHET on this matter.  It is good that she has but if she is asking the wrong question, what is the point?  There is huge confusion and anger on this issue and that anger and confusion is only growing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700046#XX00200","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1623942300,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for engaging with us in this discussion and for her attendance this morning at the meeting of the select transport committee.  It has been an unbelievably difficult year for all 140,000 or so employees in the aviation sector and the many spin-off sectors that lean heavily on it.  In the past week, we had the devastating announcement for Stobart Air employees and, with it, the realisation that ten public service obligation, PSO, routes are very much up in the air.  I welcome the announcement by Aer Lingus in the past hour that it will be able to continue those routes on an interim basis.  Emergency procurement is under way by the Department to plug that gap in the medium term, which is also welcome.  It is absolutely essential for Ireland's regions that the routes are reinstated.  In addition, there must be engagement with the many workers facing the devastating news that their employer is in liquidation.  Where will they find employment in future and how do they pick themselves up as we come out of the tail end of the pandemic?<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, there has been the devastating news, which has really hit hard in my constituency of Clare, that Aer Lingus is permanently closing its cabin crew base in Shannon.  I want to quantify what that means because it has been misinterpreted in many instances.  Losing a cabin crew base has a devastating impact on the staff employed there but also in terms of connectivity.  With a base, there are aircraft flying out in the morning and other aircraft landing in the evening and parking up overnight.  For passengers, there is the fabulous option of an early morning flight out and a late return flight.  That is what we have had for many years in the mid-west, with flights going from Shannon Airport into Heathrow Airport.  The base offered excellent onward connectivity that was key for economic activity in the region.  That will be gone if we do not have a cabin crew base.  In addition, a review of operations by Lufthansa Technik is under way, which points to the immense difficulties the maintenance, repair and overhaul, MRO, sector is experiencing.<\/p>  <p>  Of course there is also hope.  From 19 July, non-essential international air travel will be possible.  We need to look more at how that is shaped, and antigen testing must have a major role in it.  The reopening of non-essential travel might never have happened because there have been delays in implementing the plans.  I am glad Sinn F&eacute;in is now with us on this, considering it opposed the votes in the European Parliament to fast-track the system and get it further along the line and implemented within a quicker time span.  I am glad there is now commonality in the D&aacute;il in terms of getting the system up and running and operational in the quickest possible time.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding antigen testing, it is clearly set out under the digital green certificate system that there is an either-or option in terms of PCR and antigen testing.  It costs &euro;120 to &euro;150 per person to be PCR tested.<\/p> <p>The comparative cost for an antigen test is between &euro;5 and &euro;10.  They are two very different beasts.<\/p> <p> As other speakers have done, I want to knock on the head and refute the assertion that the intent of those of us who want to see antigen testing introduced is to knock PCR testing off the shelf.  PCR is the gold standard in testing.  We want to see antigen testing introduced to complement PCR testing and introduce another tier or filter, as it were, in testing, to ensure that the people who board planes and take to our skies are doing so safely.<\/p> <p> An antigen test picks up critical data on a person's antigen levels an hour or two before departure.  A PCR test is taken 72 hours before departure.  How many door handles and toilet flushers will one have touched between the time the PCR test is taken and the point of departure?  Antigen testing is a key layer of testing that we need to have in place.  It is a way of filtering out those who are positive and negative and then referring them on for PCR testing.  It is not a barrier to international travel, but an expensive PCR test very well may be.<\/p> <p> We witnessed a bizarre situation yesterday when Dr. Mary Keogan, who was addressing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, stood in front of her webcam with a bottle of water and an antigen test and proceeded to demonstrate how an antigen test result could be falsified.  It was bizarre and ludicrous.  Each one of us here wants to work within the realm of scientific and medical evidence.  That is what we have said time and again.  Dr. Tony Holohan made some points at the committee meeting yesterday.  While I compliment all of his work to date, it is important that we challenge some of the points that he made yesterday.  He stated that the use of antigen testing has to be verified and tested.  However, there are 17 other CMOs in other European states that deem it safe, possible and viable to use antigen testing as a form of testing for passengers entering and leaving their countries.  It must remain an option.<\/p> <p> I am glad that An Taoiseach and the Minister for Health voiced an openness to trialling antigen testing last night and I note the warm tones of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, on the matter today.  However, it needs to be trialled as soon as possible.  We are only four weeks away from planes taking to the skies and non-essential travel returning.  We need to see that testing happening in the field as soon as possible.  I have been saying it for several weeks, but the logical thing to do is to pick a route that is currently operational and test a cohort of passengers travelling on that route.  The data should be collected in that form to prove, like 17 other European nations have, that antigen testing is viable, safe and not very costly.  It will allow people to get back safely to the skies.<\/p> <p> I wish to pose the following question.  Have workers in the aviation sector been exploited in the Covid pandemic?  I contend that they have.  For example, if you are a Shannon Airport Aer Lingus employee with 30 or more years' loyal service to the airline, your job is gone or your future is very uncertain, to say the least.  However, for a colleague of yours in Dublin who took up employment with the airline weeks before Covid hit this country, their job is safe and well-protected.  In any place I have worked over the years, from my weekend jobs as a student in the local cinema to working as a teacher in my local school, there has been a long-standing principle of last in, first out.  It does not seem to apply in the case of Aer Lingus.  It has treated its employees in Shannon most shoddily.  It has sent them Whatsapp messages and videos on Zoom to tell them that their jobs are gone or they are being temporarily laid off and their base is being closed permanently.  That kind of messaging is all wrong.  In future, when Aer Lingus comes to the Government looking for supports, those supports must have strings attached to them.  It has to be conditional.  If it is taking Government support, &euro;150 million in Ireland Strategic Investment Fund funding, and allowing the taxpayer to cover its wage bill for 15 months, it had better look after its employees and its base in Shannon.  Aer Lingus has taken the taxpayer for a ride.  It waited until the eve of things getting back to normality and the return of international travel to pull the plug.<\/p> <p> There is a way forward.  Yesterday morning, I was joined by three party colleagues who represent a wider group that has been working for many weeks on a policy document on delivering medium to long-term recovery in aviation.  Right now, everything hinges on 19 July, but what happens in the shoulder season and the winter season?  We have put together a document which sets out potential interventions such as per-passenger payments to reduce landing charges and stimuli to ensure that routes are retained and new routes are brought in.  The document relates to areas of responsibility of the Minister of State's Department.  I urge the Minister of State to look at it so that it can see the light of day and some of the policies might be actioned.<\/p> <p> In respect of Shannon Airport, we need to hear a lot more.  A strategic review was undertaken in August of last year and we still do not fully know how it has progressed.  As I stated earlier, Shannon embodies much more than just the airport.  There are the Shannon heritage properties, for example.  We need to know where they will end up.  They have had liquidity problems in the past 15 months.  The Shannon commercial properties are doing quite well.  However, they are all intertwined.  If one goes, it will severely damage the others.  Therefore, we need to know what the future of Shannon is and who is going to be chairperson of the Shannon Group.  It is eight or nine months since Rose Hynes left her post.  An appointment was made in the interim period.  It was not the right appointment.  The less said about that, the better.  Each one of us in the region asked for the process to be slowed down to ensure that the situation could be appraised so that the right man or woman could be picked to lead the airport and Shannon Group as a whole.  That appointment has still not been made.  It must be done.<\/p> <p> Separation has not worked for Shannon.  We are a small country.  We should have one, overarching aviation authority that governs all of our airports.  We should not have this competing, predatorial relationship, with one airport vying against the other.  When we emerge from the Covid pandemic, there will be opportunities for international aviation.  There will be opportunities with north America and Europe, but they can only be delivered with the right policies.  We submitted our policy document yesterday.  I sincerely ask the Minister of State to consider the proposals.  Shannon, Cork, Dublin and Knock and all of our airports, airlines and the employees that we have spoken about today can have a viable future if we put the right policies in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700046#XX00300","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623942900,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I wish to add my voice to much of what has been said in the Chamber so far.  We are talking about the aviation industry and 140,000 people who have been under extreme pressure, given what has happened to aviation.  We must ensure that there is continuity of supports.  Even when we get up and running, we accept that there will be a long-term impact for those involved in all areas of the travel industry.  As has been stated by some of the previous speakers and as was put on the record by myself and others previously, supports, particularly for the big airlines, need to be linked to ensuring that jobs are kept for workers and their families with a view to sustaining them throughout this entire period.  Even beyond that, we must ensure that there is no diminution of workers' rights.  Obviously, we are aware of the brutal case of Stobart Air.  In looking to the future, the Government has to step up to the mark to ensure that those workers who have been absolutely hammered in recent days are given all the supports they need.  We must also look at the fact that there may be new takers for those routes from outside.  In that case, we must ensure that there is no diminution of the rights of workers in respect of pay or subcontracting.  We need to ensure that we keep an eye on that.  Government must do that.<\/p>  <p>  We have spoken about 19 July and the possible resumption of international travel.  We all accept that public health must be taken into account across the board.  Two things are required.  There must be complete clarity in relation to the EU digital Covid certificate and how it is going to work within the State.  Details must be provided on it.  We need to know at what point the app will be up and running and how it will work in respect of the relevant testing regime or vaccination information to ensure that it can be uploaded or produced onto the paper copy.  We really need detail on that.  We cannot have a case where 19 July arrives and we do not have the tools that are required to facilitate people to engage in international travel.<\/p>  <p>  We have had many conversations in relation to antigen testing.  There may be some element of a disputed narrative in respect of communication between NPHET, the Department and the two Ministers.  In fairness, the CMO, Dr. Holohan, told us yesterday in the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications that there is an insufficient amount of evidence from his perspective.  However, he also stated that he would fully support a pilot scheme if it was put in place.  That means that the Department, the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, need to get their act together in respect of putting the correct questions down and ensuring that the correct parameters are put in place.<\/p> <p>They must ensure that there is a deal with the aviation industry from the point of view of putting a proper plan in place to carry out antigen testing as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> We all know it would have been far better had we done this three or six months ago.  We are where we are, however, on this.  While there are difficulties and public health has to be taken into account, we need to ensure that we have all the tools necessary to get us beyond this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700047#YY00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623943500,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I want to add my voice to those of other Deputies.  We need to be cognisant of the real and genuine fear in the aviation industry about the potential for thousands of job losses over the coming months.  There is a genuine fear that this pandemic is being used by some companies in the aviation industry to effectively restructure, get rid of jobs with good terms and conditions and then seek to replace them in the future with lower pay and conditions.  In terms of its approach, there is no way the Government can stand back from that.  It needs to address that serious fear.<\/p><p>Every time a Government representative responds to questions about job losses on the airwaves or elsewhere, the key message is always about job losses in other European countries.  It is as if those involved are seeking to somewhat normalise the job losses here.  The Government is not responsible for what happens in other countries.  It is responsible for our jobs, our workers and our aviation industry.  When workers are losing their jobs, the Government should not seek to normalise it by saying jobs are being lost in other European countries.  It is the business of governments in those countries to answer for that.<\/p><p>The report of the aviation recovery task force was published almost a year ago, on 7 July 2020.  Only two of its 12 recommendations have been implemented.  One of those two recommendations is not specific to the aviation sector.  The other has been implemented intermittently.  The task force reported ahead of schedule, did its job and worked constructively.  We need to know from the Government why it has not implemented those recommendations.<\/p><p>An excellent article in <i>The Currency<\/i>carried interviews with people in the aviation industry.  There is a real fear that because the Irish aviation industry has done so well in the past and until recently, that the Government feels a hands-off approach is okay.  They are worried about that attitude.<\/p><p>The digital green certificate will come in on 19 July.  We do not yet have details about it.  The general public does not know how it will operate, how they can access it or if it will be applied to the US and Canada.  It is vital that confidence among the public is rebuilt in travel and aviation.  How can we rebuild confidence when people do not know the picture with regard to the digital screen certificate on 19 July?  People plan ahead for months when they are booking flights.  The sooner we get that information out will be critically important to the recovery.<\/p><p>One recommendation of the aviation task force stated an efficient and effective track-and-trace system was needed for opening up.  Why has this not been implemented?  What are the Government's plans in that regard?  The track-and-trace system is important for aviation and other sectors.  Vaccination will do most of the work in building up public confidence.  However, those sorts of measures around track-and-trace are important as well.  There is pent-up demand for travel and people who will want to travel abroad straight away.  We are also going to see a significant number of people who will be hesitant and fearful.  That is why the measures which build confidence and the information around that are so important.  We must make the most out of the digital green certificate on 19 July by getting that information out to people as quickly as possible.  This will restore confidence and underpin the recovery.  I appeal to the Government to be much more proactive in terms of jobs losses, especially in the context of the fight to retain terms and conditions in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700048#ZZ00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1623943500,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here dealing with her portfolio and responsibility for the area of aviation.  There is no question our aviation sector and the 140,000 livelihoods supported by it before Covid-19 are under serious pressure.  The Government must do absolutely everything it can to help rebuild our connectivity, the economic strength of the aviation sector before Covid and to provide the supports that are necessary to enable that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  At yesterday's meeting of the transport committee, I went into quite a lot of detail on the major issues we are not addressing, including antigen testing.  One point made by the Chief Medical Officer to the committee which quite concerned me related to whether the Department of Transport had engaged with NPHET directly on the issue of such testing.  I would encourage an increase in the level of contact between NPHET, the Departments of Transport and Health on the use of rapid antigen testing in airport settings. That is crucial.<\/p>  <p>  I am a Deputy from Cork and I want to use my time to discuss Cork Airport.  It is an incredibly important hub for connectivity and for investment into the Cork region, as well as for international tourism.  I am worried about the level of support that our airport is getting.  As it is under the umbrella of the Dublin Airport Authority, which is obviously good in many circumstances but also from the point of view of its own financial situation, it is important the airport gets the same level of funding Shannon gets for capital expenditure, capex, and operating expenditure, opex.<\/p>  <p>  We are going to see a long recovery period in the aviation sector.  To assist our airports in opening up the new routes required and rebuilding the routes that have been affected by Covid, they will need continued financial assistance from the Department over the next number of years.  In the context of capex and opex funding, it is crucial that the Department continues to work to secure funding for airports such as that in Cork.  We desperately need that to happen.  If it does not happen, it will put enormous strain on Cork Airport and aviation in general across the southern half of the country.  I am told by aviation executives that we could be looking potentially at a three- to four-year recovery period to get back to levels of traffic similar to those that obtained in 2019.  Obviously, this is not fantastic news for people working in aviation.  It is deeply troubling to them in fact.  We have to ensure the State does everything it possibly can.<\/p>  <p>  It has been highlighted to me repeatedly by the people working in airport management that they are concerned about the level of advancement in terms of the Government's integration of the digital green certificate technology and about some of the anomalies which need to be addressed.  Will the Minister of State have a round-table discussion with our airport CEOs and relevant management on that particular issue with the Irish Aviation Authority and other relevant stakeholders?  We need to get that right from the start.  We cannot afford to waste any more time on that particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700048#ZZ00300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1623943500,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I want to raise national as well as local topics.  The Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, was before the transport committee yesterday.  He is fully supportive of a pilot rapid antigen testing programme for the aviation sector.  The Minister of State wrote to Ministers on 11 May.  We would have written to the Minister and the Department on 6 May with a specific request on a rapid antigen testing pilot programme for the aviation sector.<\/p> <p>That was over a month ago, as was the Minister of State&rsquo;s letter.  We could have covered a pilot test scheme in that time.  As a matter of urgency, we now need to move at speed as we now know that the CMO, Dr. Holohan, and NPHET are now supportive of a rapid antigen testing programme being set up.  This will require logistics.  <\/p> <p> We need to move from the abstract to putting this in place.  It will require engagement from NPHET.  I ask the Minister of State to pick up the phone and ring the Dr. Tony Holohan and start discussing with NPHET how this can be put in place.  The airline industry needs to be contacted as it will have to be part of this rapid antigen test pilot programme.  These are the two key players.  <\/p> <p> The type of test that we will be using then needs to be decided upon, as well as the routes that will be used.  The UK is already looking at this and has the information technology, IT, systems in place.  We need then a rapid antigen pilot testing programme established straightaway and not in a complicated fashion but with the correct metrics.  We then need to run it in line with the introduction of the digital green certificate here in Ireland on 19 July.  That is just over four weeks away.  This is a serious amount of time when one is trying to get work done but it can be eroded very quickly if nothing is done.  I ask the Minister of State to address where NPHET want to see the evidence and validation and this can be done through a pilot programme. <\/p> <p> Furthermore, the report of Professor Ferguson of the Covid-19 rapid antigen group needs to be seriously considered by all Departments and by NPHET itself.  It is a worthwhile document.<\/p> <p> I want to move on to Shannon Airport, my local airport.  It is critical that any supports that are given to companies such as Aer Lingus, and it will need supports, must have built into them the issue of regional connectivity, the Shannon-Heathrow slot and that the transatlantic routes will continue out of Shannon.  <\/p> <p> Second, we must expedite the appointment of a chair for the board of Shannon Group.  That is critical.  We need somebody to head this body.<\/p> <p> Third, we need to see the review of Shannon Airport that has been ongoing within the Department for quite some time brought to a conclusion.  Shannon Airport is vital to our region.  We need to see it up and running.  We see where Stobart Air were flying routes but were not flying existing routes out of Shannon.  We need to reconnect those routes through Aer Lingus or other providers.  <\/p> <p>At this stage it is all systems go and we need to see absolute progress in getting down to the nuts and bolts of putting on place a pilot testing programme for aviation.  This is about picking up the phone and ringing the airlines, Dr. Tony Holohan and NPHET, to forming a working group to say what we have to do now and to roll this out with immediate effect.  The antigen tests are on the market, are there and are being used by the HSE on outbreaks as matters stand.  The products are there and it is about putting the metrics in place and doing it in rapid-speed time in line with rapid antigen testing in order that we can be up and running around 19 July, aiming at that date as our target, or shortly thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700048#ZZ00400","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623944100,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, outlined previous funding announcements in her statement that were very much welcome at the time but I am here to tell her that it is not enough for Shannon Airport.  I take no pleasure in commenting on the sorry state of aviation recovery this afternoon but I know that the people of Clare are absolutely exhausted and frustrated by the lack of direct action and ambition from the Department of Transport in the threatened status of our regional airports and, specifically, Shannon Airport.<\/p><p>It is indisputably at a critical point and Covid-19 has obviously had a detrimental effect on the aviation industry.  What is even more devastating, however, is the lack of preventative measures taken to preserve the increasingly threatened stability of Shannon Airport.  We have seen the net result of <i>laissez-faire<\/i>Government involvement as our airports have essentially had to compete against one another.  That is no way to protect an industry and to ensure equal opportunities to thrive.  The whole island benefits from balanced regional development and it makes sense, as our nation&rsquo;s aviation sector as a whole would be more resilient, sustainable and equitable if balanced, regional development was genuinely high on the priority list for the Government.  Dublin Airport Authority will protect Dublin and Cork airports but what about the rest of the regional airports of this island?<\/p><p>What about Shannon specifically?  The dwindling numbers of both footfall and staff numbers demonstrated that Shannon Airport needed more protectionist measures to be taken to safeguard its viability.  The Government response has consistently been a reactionary one rather than proactive and it has failed to take affirmative concrete action.  Shannon Airport, as we know, boasts the longest runway in the country.  It is also continuously mislabelled as a regional airport when it is in fact an international airport.  Recently, a local Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Donna McGettigan, set up a petition calling for a semi-State authority encompassing the international airports of Shannon, Cork and Dublin and within a week it received over 13,500 signatures.  This is what the people want.<\/p><p>We know that the aviation sector has taken multiple blows.  The pandemic essentially ground their activity to a halt.  However, the broken record of reference after reference to task forces being set up, of reports and reviews, is not lost on the people.  These exercises in futility have amounted to little more than a talking shop where very little concrete constructive action is taken.  Where are the findings of the review, for example, as pledged by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, into the Shannon Group structures?  The findings were never published or made known to the public and it seems futile to continue issuing reviews or reports if the conclusions of these inquiries are not used instructively.  <\/p><p>The same goes for the task force for aviation recovery, as established by the former Minister, Shane Ross, last year.  The recommendations were never implemented.  Why has the Department commissioned reviews and simply not paid heed to their recommendations? <\/p><p>The aviation sector has been waiting for a roadmap as to how to proceed and emerge from these 15 months of stagnation and has not been given accurate guidance on how to plan for the reopening.  The Government has held back on commitments to the extended provision of significant financial support for airports and airline workers and at the same time, it has refused to take measures to ensure that a swift, safe, and sustainable return of international travel is even possible. <\/p><p>Where does that leave the sector?  The health of Shannon Airport is intrinsically linked to the integrity of tourism, hospitality and many other micro-economies that are of great importance to Clare and the region.

This is an airport that is set to be closed for a period of ten weeks from 12 September to 22 November, as repairs are being made to the main runway.  Workers are facing a very difficult situation.  These are workers in Aer Lingus, Swissport, OCS and in other airport workplaces.  For example, Aer Lingus plans to temporarily lay off 200 workers, who will be forced to go on the dole and will not be paid by the company for that time or kept on the books.  They have been kept on the books all through the pandemic but they are to be taken off the books for this period of ten weeks.  Why is that?  There is growing concern and fears among the workforce for their jobs and as to whether they will have a job to come back to.  There are also concerns about their wages and conditions.  It is the case that the company cannot legally change the wages and conditions of the workers while they have been temporarily laid off.  Aer Lingus, however, has form.  It is trying to organise a race to the bottom and to drive down wages and conditions and will try to exploit any situation to try to gain leverage here.  Workers have had proposals put in front of them recently and I can inform Aer Lingus that they are not going to be accepted.<\/p> <p>They include a five-year pay freeze, pay cuts, new starting rates of &euro;12.30 an hour and changes to both the sick pay scheme and duty allowances - needless to say, in the wrong direction.  Will Aer Lingus use the ten-week shutdown to increase the pressure on the workers to accept these changes to conditions?  It would be naive for anyone to think it would do otherwise.<br\/><br\/> Aer Lingus is a company in receipt of state aid.  At the moment, for example, it is in receipt of the employment wage subsidy scheme and other supports.  The State should not give Aer Lingus or the other companies I mentioned that are based at Cork Airport a blank cheque.  Conditions should be attached to the moneys these companies receive, and one of those conditions should be that those workers will not be laid off, temporarily or otherwise, and that they will be left on the books in the way they have been throughout the pandemic.<br\/><br\/>There is silence from both the Minister of State and senior Ministers on the issue.  The Government says this is a matter for the company and it is not prepared to interfere with the dealings of a private company.  That is not good enough.  Working people have kept this country going throughout the pandemic.  They deserve to be treated with fairness and respect.  Laying off these workers for a period of ten weeks, and increasing the pressure on them in regard to their jobs, wages and conditions, is not acceptable.  It should not be acceptable to the Government and it is certainly not acceptable to me or to the workers at Cork Airport.<br\/><br\/>This issue is not going to go away.  As we come closer to that deadline date, pressure will increase on the Government and on local Government Deputies, and I want it to be increased to the maximum extent possible.  There needs to be fair play and justice for the Cork Airport workers and that means they must be kept on the books and not temporarily laid off.  What is the Government going to do about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700049#AAA00300","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623944700,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important debate.  The Covid pandemic has devastated the aviation industry, which was at a record high prior to the outbreak of the pandemic.  In terms of passenger numbers, Shannon Airport was the second largest long-haul airport and the third largest airport overall in Ireland.  Prior to Covid, it added up to &euro;3.6 billion to Ireland's GDP and supported 43,700 jobs.  The potential of the airport was not being reached prior to the pandemic and there is real concern it will struggle to emerge from the impact of Covid.  The Government has provided life support to Shannon Airport and other airports by means of various supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the operational and capital supports provided.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State will be aware, Shannon Airport connects the west of Ireland to the rest of the world.  The restoration of connectivity is vital to Shannon Airport, the mid-west and western regions, the business community, including the large footprint of foreign direct investment, FDI, companies the airport serves, and the tourism industry all along the western seaboard.  This week marked the long-awaited and welcome return of passenger traffic at Shannon Airport, with eight Ryanair routes now operating.  It is my understanding that Ryanair plans to add further destinations to its Shannon Airport schedule ahead of the return of non-essential international travel on 19 July.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, Shannon Airport was served a significant blow with the news that Aer Lingus is to permanently close its cabin crew base.  This decision has had and will have a very negative impact on Shannon Airport and the mid-west.  There was also the overnight closure of Stobart Air, another blow to aviation.  I reiterate my request that the Government use the leverage of its current talks with Aer Lingus in regard to the bailout to reinstate the Aer Lingus cabin crew base at Shannon Airport and that these discussions be used to re-establish connectivity to Heathrow, New York, Boston and a European hub.<\/p>  <p>  Ours is an island nation that depends on air connectivity.  While the Government has invested in the vicinity of &euro;300 million in the sector to date, this constituted what were effectively life-support measures.  We now desperately need to invest directly in airlines to restore vital strategic routes and ensure the viability of the airlines that provide that connectivity and the jobs they support.  Throughout Europe and the wider world, governments have provided billions of euro in state support to safeguard airlines and the jobs and connectivity they provide.  As an island nation, why have we as a State not done the same?<\/p>  <p>  We also need to get our heads out of the sand in regard to the use of rapid antigen testing as a tool to reopen international travel and follow the lead of the 17 other European countries that use such tests.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, of which I am a member, has been advocating for the use of rapid antigen testing since last year, and it is deeply disappointing that not even one pilot air corridor using it has been opened.  The Minister for Transport should be leading this initiative.  I ask the Minister of State to re-engage on the issue of antigen testing and ensure it will be rolled out as a vital tool in reopening international travel.<\/p>  <p>  Shannon Chamber and the Irish Hotels Federation have been engaging with the Minister of State on the number of proposals the Government has developed to help spark a recovery in aviation.  They argue that the recovery and growth of Shannon Airport's previously viable air services will require a sustained period of multi-annual funding until at least 2024 and potentially as late as 2029, depending on when air traffic returns to 2019 levels.  I strongly support their proposals, which include multi-year capital expenditure funding to enable the smaller State-owned airports, such as Shannon Airport, to navigate their way out of the current crisis; a fixed sum per passenger to subsidise airport charges for airlines, which is the type of funding needed to grow traffic at regional airports; and the provision of a regional route marketing fund allocated to Tourism Ireland, also on a multi-annual basis, as a restoration of Ireland's air services, which is essential to connect our island to global markets that drive our industrial tourism and international services sector.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government is serious about balanced regional development and unlocking the potential of economic drivers such as Shannon Airport, national aviation policy will have to be amended.  Prior to Covid, Dublin Airport increased its share of the total number of passengers travelling through Ireland from 73% in 2005 to 86% in 2018.  The increasing dominance of Dublin needs to be addressed in a similar way to the approach taken in other states that have implemented policy initiatives to counteract the dominance of the main national airport and mitigate negative impacts on other airports.  The Dutch Government, for example, has capped the number of aircraft movements through Schiphol Airport to address the imbalance.  The full capacity of Shannon Airport is 4.5 million passengers, yet only 1.8 million passengers used the airport in 2019.  If the capacity at Shannon Airport can act as a buffer to Dublin Airport and be an integral part of Irish aviation policy, the synergies will be beneficial to both Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to press ahead with the appointment of a chairperson of the board of Shannon Group.  It is of utmost importance that the successful candidate will have a strong background in aviation, business and tourism and a deep understanding of the mid-west and western regions.  This is a crucial appointment for Shannon Airport and it is important that the necessary resources be made available to assist the successful candidate in taking on the role of chairperson of Shannon Group to develop a recovery plan for the airport and region in the wake of the pandemic.  I ask the Minister of State also to publish the review of the structures of Shannon Group, which was initiated many months ago.<\/p> <p>The structures were to be looked at and we were to receive feedback.  It is very disappointing that review has not been published and we do not have any idea when it will be.  There are obvious issues in relation to Shannon Heritage and where it sits within Shannon Group, which we have brought to the Minister of State's attention.  That issue needs to be brought to a conclusion at the earliest opportunity.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to the points raised in the course of my contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700050#BBB00200","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623945300,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Time and again I have stood in this convention centre and in the Chamber across the water and raised the difficulties facing the aviation sector.  Many sectors were closed by the Government's public health restrictions out of necessity, but those sectors had a plan for their reopening.  Aviation was closed and a task force established, but the recommendations of that task force have been completely set aside by the Government without any explanation.  There was never a plan.  The plan was to close; there was never a plan for reopening.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised numerous and a diverse range of issues relating to cabin crew, ground staff, pilots, maintenance staff in our airports, retail businesses in our terminals, mechanics, engineers and businesses such as LDS Ltd, Luggage Delivery Services International, which are locked out of supports to the airlines.  The only constant in the issues I raised is the Government's failure to deal with them and resolve them in the interests of the workers concerned.  Workers in the sector are devastated.  They are on reduced hours and pay.  Some are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and others the employment wage subsidy scheme.  While many have been accessing jobseeker's benefit and short-term work supports, others have suffered the loss of their jobs completely.<\/p>  <p>  Many workers across the sector have now received the news they have lost their entitlements to social protection supports because they have exceeded the days they can claim for.  I am working with dozens of people through my offices in Swords and Balbriggan, and throughout Fingal, who are impacted by this.  My colleague, Deputy Claire Kerrane, and I have raised this issue and we simply cannot get any movement on it.  The rules around requalification were not drawn up with a pandemic in mind.  They do not work for workers in this instance.  The supports need to be extended beyond the current six and nine months and the rules around requalification have to be suspended.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, just a few weeks ago, we heard the devastating announcement by Aer Lingus regarding base closures, along with the collapse of Stobart Air.  Stobart ceased trading with a loss of 480 jobs and a liquidator has been appointed.  More than 140,000 jobs depend on aviation and ensuring the island remains connected.  At the heart of this devastation is a Minister and Government that have a completely hands-off approach to the aviation sector.  Without our connectivity we are lost.  The Government needs to hear the core message that it must protect our connectivity and aviation jobs.  I am blue in the face saying this.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the pandemic, workers and unions in the sector have called for two things, namely, supports and a plan.  The supports for workers, airlines and airports are a fraction of what is needed, based on international comparisons.  As I stated in the Chamber some weeks back, countries in Europe connected by rail and road invested far more in their aviation sector than we have, even though we are an island on the edge of the Atlantic absolutely dependent upon aviation.  We really need to catch up.<\/p>  <p>  I will mention the Stobart workers.  A liquidator has been appointed.  Some of the workers are in a trade union and some are in a staff association.  They are absolutely lost.  I ask the Minister of State to appoint a person in her Department to liaise directly with these workers.  I ask her, and she might cover this in her closing remarks, whether she believes there will be a transfer of undertakings for some or all of these workers or how many of them might be involved in a transfer of undertakings, TUPE, arrangement.  It is really important for them to know that now.  I ask the Minister of State to talk to her colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, and ask her if a link person can be provided to liaise with these people because they are all at sea now.  They do not know what is going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700051#CCC00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1623945300,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I am very conscious that in speaking about the aviation sector I am speaking about the future lives and livelihoods of more than 140,000 people around the country who work in this sector, along with a huge number of ancillary service providers who themselves offer significant employment.  The sector, pre-Covid, was worth &euro;4.1 billion to the Irish economy.  In 2019, 38.1 million passengers passed through the airports.  The changing threats that Covid has presented have reduced passenger air traffic in and out of Ireland to a trickle, with a resultant dramatic fall in income for many of those employed in the sector.  I have received numerous letters and emails from pilots, cabin crew, ground staff and husbands and wives who are in dire financial straits as they try to keep mortgages and other financial payments up to date on significantly reduced incomes, wondering all the while if they will have any job to return to.<\/p>  <p>  The narrative now is to look forward to the opening up of the economy and build back better.  Our aviation sector, one of the strongest-performing components of our economy pre-Covid, has suffered hugely as a result of the need to try to protect our population at large.  The Government now needs to reassess the importance of this sector to our future national economic recovery and to provide contingent funding to ensure this sector can survive the rest of this year as, hopefully, we build a recovery in the aviation component.  For those for whom re-employment in the sector may not be possible, Government must prioritise new training and access programmes to offer these people an avenue to return to gainful employment.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen persistent mixed messaging on the aviation sector regarding a possible reopening date, which appears dependent on our participation in the European digital travel certificate programme, potentially signalled as 19 July.  This return promises some reinstatement of passenger travel in and out of Ireland, but for anyone unvaccinated it will come at the expense of at least one PCR test and either enforced or agreed quarantine for up to ten days after arrival into Ireland.  These continuing restrictions are, judging by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, contribution to the transport committee yesterday, going to remain in place until those flying are virtually fully vaccinated.  Any proposals regarding rapid screen testing for those flying into Irish airports seem now to be completely off the table, according to the Chief Medical Officer.  It appears public health advice will remain consistent in taking no proactive measures to encourage travel or initiate any type of antigen testing that might help restore inward and outward travel to Ireland to any greater degree.  This is completely at odds with what is happening with other European peers.<\/p>  <p>  The strictures around testing and quarantine mean that many of our traditional international tourism markets will only function to the degree that international travellers are fully vaccinated.  This has obvious implications for international tourist visitation, possibly up to the end of this year and beyond, depending on what variants may be in circulation elsewhere.  It is worth reminding ourselves that tourism visits to Ireland in 2019 were of the order of 17 million visitors so we can see the breadth of the national problem we are facing.<\/p>  <p>  Serious question must now also be raised regarding the future viability of our regional airports and, perhaps, even our international connectivity.  Past decisions to sell the final tranche of Government ownership of Aer Lingus now appear to have been unwise.  Given that Aer Lingus represents approximately 5% of International Airline Group's, IAG, commercial activity, the degree to which the parent company will continue to offer further support to its Irish subsidiary remains unclear.  Beyond offering soft loans, what else is Government proposing to do to ensure we retain as many travel connections as possible from our pre-Covid portfolio?<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the precarious state of our regional airports network, which has been clearly demonstrated by the failure of Stobart Air, what plans is Government envisaging to ensure our regions have viable connectivity to support the activities of multiple foreign direct investment, FDI, concerns based all around the country?  I highlight Waterford Airport, in which I have a particular interest, where Government has given commitments to the extension of the runway.  I wish to see these progressed, along with other supports to regional airports.<\/p>  <p>  Nothing in life stays the same and neither does it in the aviation sector.  Irish companies became some of the largest and best in the world, in terms of aircraft financing and creating successful low-cost travel options.  Although the sectors have been severely dented, it is worth noting that Ireland has a significant diaspora who will wish to visit these shores again, along with an abundance of international travellers who will want to visit once the Covid situation is completely under control.  It is the responsibility of Government to ensure we retain adequate aviation capacity in order to kick-start travel opportunity as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, must be encouraged to return to the House in the coming weeks to highlight the ongoing planning to secure these objectives.<\/p> <p> I will raise a couple of points with respect to European travel, as a marker of how we are doing.  European aviation tracking is now at 46% of 2019 levels and continues to rise.  Some days it has exceeded 50%.  Ryanair has brought around 800 additional flights per day into the European aviation market since 1 June, contributing to a 147% rise in flights over two weeks.  There have been high increases for many states, with flights in Spain, Italy, Germany and France up 32%, 40%, 20% and 15%, respectively.  These are substantial figures which reflect our position in terms of loss of competitiveness and reduced flying activity.  We have to address this.<\/p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s population is more than 1.1% of the European Union, yet its allocation under the European resilience fund was only 0.75%.  Can we not fight for more of this fund to support our ailing aviation sector?  More can be done in this regard.  We are in a tough spot financially with Covid but our aviation sector was one of the bright stars pre-Covid.  We must do all we can and give all the support we can to try to ensure the sector gets back on its feet as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700051#CCC00300","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623945900,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about regional aviation and regional airports.  There were many challenges facing our regional airport sector and aviation before the pandemic.  They have been considerably accentuated over the past 15 months.  We have seen how fragile our aviation sector is, in spite of the fine tradition we have.  That fine tradition and those foundations mean we can rebuild stronger and better.  The foundations, in terms of its regional support, ability to drive employment creation and identity, are important and it is also important we continue to protect them.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work the Minister of State has done since her appointment to support Ireland West Airport in Knock, in particular, and the regional aviation sector generally.  We can do much more and we should use this opportunity to reset how the State treats regional airports, particularly the non-State regional airports.  We should reassess their funding model to give more certainty to airport management and staff.  I compliment the staff and management at Ireland West Airport, who have done an enormous job in incredibly difficult circumstances.  Many have been put on short time and they were placed on the PUP and various other payments when the airport was closed.  The Government has provided support through the standard business supports.  Staff are getting ready to reopen and grow the airport once more.<\/p>  <p>  Before Covid, the regional airports, particularly the non-State regional airports, were the Cinderella of the transport sector.  We have to get real about integrating them fully by providing State supports similar to the many supports some of the State airports get.  Their funding must be provided on a multi-annual basis to enable them to plan operations and capital beyond 12 months.  We need route supports for new airlines to add to the existing airlines in our regional airport network.<\/p>  <p>  There were difficulties facing airlines flying aircraft in and out of regional airports before last weekend.  Let us use the example of Stobart, regional air connectivity and the PSO issue as a chance to reset the supports we give to airlines to fly in and out of our regional airport network and add new routes.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland West Airport has been a dynamic model for Mayo and the west.  Pre-Covid, we were planning the development of a strategic development zone, SDZ, around the airport to make more of the land asset around the airport and provide economic support, infrastructure and planning for the area.  The Covid recovery plan and national development plan review offer the Government a chance to support the airport board and Mayo County Council in developing, planning and marketing the SDZ as a place for business. <\/p>  <p>  I congratulate everybody involved in the EirTrade Aviation initiative.  EirTrade Aviation is an end-of-life aviation company working on aeroplanes and beginning the construction of a hangar.  This industry was very successful previously and can be again.  It can ensure talent and skills can stay in the regions can, not just in construction but also in airline maintenance.<\/p>  <p>  Other measures can be taken in respect of Ireland West Airport Knock, given the facility it is and the size of its runway.  Creating an international cargo hubs is one example, and the space, runway and will to do so are there.  If Government support is put in place to develop such a hub in the Covid recovery plan, the airport and management have consistently shown their ability to deliver on Government priorities and will do so on this occasion.<\/p>  <p>  This would also be an opportunity to properly develop the western rail corridor, from Athenry to Claremorris and up to Sligo, by developing a rail connection to Ireland West Airport and connecting the western rail corridor to Shannon Airport.  Linking our two airports on the Wild Atlantic Way and the Atlantic economic corridor by rail would enhance their attractiveness as destinations for inward and outward journeys and enhance the attractiveness of the western rail corridor project.  Notwithstanding the flawed EY and JASPERS reviews, the project is still economically viable and can be the backbone for the regeneration of the western economy.  It would also substantially reduce carbon.  Linking the corridor to our airports to encourage people to use rail would be a way of doing that.<\/p>  <p>  We can do so much more with the regional airport network, particularly the non-State regional airport network.  We can use the innovation and ingenuity which its management have shown in response to tight resources to regrow the network.  The priorities have been laid out in the aviation recovery plan.<\/p>  <p>  I know this is difficult.  It is intriguing to hear Deputies who were cheerleading and demanding the introduction of quarantine a few months ago now criticising quarantine for the impact it is having on our aviation sector.  It was clear that it would have an impact.  We are still in a challenging situation regarding the transmissibility of variants and we have to be realistic about that.  If the regional airport sector was given a sense that there is a plan for the future or an interest in developing one and that the Government's ambition for the sector matched its own ambition, it would work with the Minister of State to develop and put flesh on that ambition, create jobs and enhance sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  We will get through Covid.  International travel will resume.  We need to ensure we have the infrastructure in place in our regional airports, such as Ireland West Airport Knock, and staff supports continue.  Aviation will take much longer to come out of Covid than other sectors.  We need to make sure we have the route promotion and marketing supports the regional airports need to compete with the major State airports on this island and across the world to attract incoming airlines.<\/p>  <p> We have a fine track record in aircraft leasing.  That continues with some of the major international players still operating here on the foundations established many years ago through Guinness Peat Aviation, GPA.  We have a fine transport aviation sector in our airlines and regional airport network.  We need to get them through this.  I am convinced that if the Minister of State and Government show energy, commitment and investment, our regional airports, such as Ireland West Airport, will come through this crisis.  No airport on this island has shown an ability to come through a challenge or crisis quite like Ireland West Airport has.  It will come through this one.  It needs the Government to come through with it and partner it.  It needs the Government to have the same level of ambition for the airport that the community, management and staff have for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700052#DDD00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1623945900,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here.  I listened to the debate on &ldquo;Saturday with Katie Hannon&rdquo; last Saturday.<\/p> <p>I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, whom I greatly respect, speak on behalf of the Government and there were also people from the aviation industry.  I heard Michael O'Leary in a phone call to the programme.  Like him or lump him, he talks great sense.  He just said that, unfortunately, the Minister has no plan, no roadmap and is disinterested.  He is more concerned with pushing and forcing through his utopian green agenda.  We saw that last night.<\/p> <p> I wish no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  I want to ask her about the wonderful Aer Lingus pilots we met outside week after week.  I salute the pilots and staff of Ryanair, Stobart Air and iarSheanad&oacute;ir P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, who started the airline.  Our country is being ravaged.  We were meant to be ravaged by a plague but now we are being ravaged by Dr. Holohan and his cabal, and the Government is standing idly by.  Those in government are like bystanders &ndash; shamefully innocent bystanders.  One would think they were asleep.  They are in some kind of a trance.<\/p> <p> One person is too many to be sick in hospital but we had 67 patients in hospital on Monday, supposedly with Covid, 23 of whom were in ICU.  I wish them all a happy recovery.  I remember being at the first meetings in Government Buildings and we were all shocked and frightened when we were told about the doomsday situation.  I salute everybody who worked on it.  I sympathise with anyone who lost their life or got seriously ill, but now we must get real.  What kind of a grip do these people have?  Some of them are narcissists.  They have terrorised the people for long enough and now they want to browbeat them to hell or to Connacht.<\/p> <p> We had a lovely airport in Knock and now that will be destroyed.  Shannon has been neglected for decades and Dublin has been confused.  More money has been bulldozed into it.  Everything is about Dublin.  Could we blame people for being conspiracy theorists when they see what is going on?  Educated people are looking on and they see NPHET running the country.  Now, the Climate Change Advisory Council is going to make decisions, advise the Minister on decisions and bypass this House.  Why are we paying &euro;27,000 a day for this building or maintaining D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that the people of 1916 and the period 1921-1923 fought for, who devised the first Constitution, when it is being trodden on?  What is going on here?<\/p> <p> We are so proud of our green Aer Lingus aeroplanes and the company's gallant staff.  I listened to many of them on air with Deputy McNamara and others here on Zoom calls literally telling us that they moved from Dublin back to the country.  They have been living there for 20 years but they are now being forced back to hell or to go anywhere they like.  We have a Minister for Transport who is not interested in their jobs.  He is not interested in the economy recovering.  The IMF is saying that it will cost &euro;20 billion per annum to pay for what we put through last night, which was forced through without debate.  Where are we going to get the money to help the aviation industry and all the associated industries recover?  God be good to Pat The Cope Gallagher, the former Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  He is alive and well and kicking.  He always used, and boasted about, the aeroplanes to Donegal and the connectivity with Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Knock and anyplace else.  Those people are entitled to that modicum of service but, above all, we are entitled to have the economy recover.  There is no sign of it recovering because insurance companies are not paying out to anybody, the banks are not loaning any money and we have all the cabals with regulators and everybody else who are just letting things drift along.<\/p> <p> Nobody is forced to be accountable.  We need an international investigation into the handling of Covid in Ireland, not another cloak-and-dagger session here now.  We need independent people from abroad to come in.  That is what it takes.  We must have it, but I do not know how we are going to get it.  We must have it to get honesty, answers and information on how people were mistreated and how all the people were literally slaughtered in nursing homes and hospitals where they picked up Covid.  It is a shocking indictment.  It is still going on 15 months later and there is no sign of the restrictions being lifted or changed.  We need accountability.  I do not know how we are going to get it, but we need nothing short of an international investigation on the handling of it.  Medical people have phoned me demanding that because of what is going on and the intimidation of anyone that speaks out or asks a question.  It is said they are all conspiracy theorists and they are not wearing the green jersey.  The Minister for Transport is not wearing the green jersey.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet are not wearing the green jersey.  Neither is the Minister of State.  She is not wearing the green jersey.  Let our people live.  Open up the country and let us do what we are best at doing: entertaining people who come to visit us and go to places like Kerry and west Cork.  The runway at Cork Airport will be repaired now but they could not do it when Covid was there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700052#DDD00300","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623946500,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I have no doubt of the veracity of what the Minister of State said to the House, but I have a lot of questions about the advice she is receiving.  I want to bring a couple of documents to her attention.  The first is the regulation that has been introduced with regard to the so-called digital green certificate.  I refer to Regulation (EU) 2021\/935 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June.  The preamble specifically refers to antigen testing.  Recital 37 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAs the pandemic has progressed, a new generation of faster and cheaper tests has become available on the Union market, the so-called rapid antigen tests, which detect the presence of viral proteins (antigens) to detect an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020\/1743 (12) sets out guidance for Member States regarding the use of such rapid antigen tests. <\/blockquote>  <p>Recital 38 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Council Recommendation of 21 January 2021 (13) sets out a common framework for the use and validation of rapid antigen tests and the mutual recognition of COVID-19 test results in the Union and provides for the development of a common list of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests. <\/blockquote>  <p>Recital 40 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo ensure the reliability of the test result, only the results of NAAT tests and rapid antigen tests featured in the list established on the basis of the Council Recommendation of 21 January 2021 should be eligible for a test certificate&rdquo;, in other words, a green certificate. <\/blockquote>  <p>It is interesting that there is no differentiation at all between PCR testing and rapid antigen testing.  Recital 41 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe use of rapid antigen tests would serve to facilitate the issuance of test certificates on an affordable basis. Universal, timely and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines and tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which form the basis for the issuance of the certificates making up the EU Digital COVID Certificate, is crucial in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700053#EEE00500","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1623946500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700053#EEE00600","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1623946500,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Either-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700053#EEE00700","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1623946500,"counter":379,"content":"<p>The Deputies sharing have two and a half minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700053#EEE00800","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1623946500,"counter":380,"content":"<p>-----those advising the Minister of State are right or the rest of the European Union is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700053#EEE00900","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1623946500,"counter":381,"content":"<p>There are only two minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700053#EEE01000","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1623946500,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I will leave it with the Minister of State.

The 480 staff learned of the closure and liquidation of the company on Saturday morning and flights were halted immediately.  On Monday, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that Nordica, the Estonian state-owned airline, offered to take on the Kerry-Dublin route.  Connectivity from Donegal is needed for work, tourism and medical appointments.  The airport there is a vital piece of infrastructure and is now sitting fully equipped but unused.  The Department knew that regional airports were in trouble with reduced passenger numbers but also that they remain vitally important for connectivity, but nothing was done up to the weekend.  Talks with replacement airlines were not accelerated and contingency plans were not put in place to ensure that there would be no break in service.  I am pleased to see that the Government, through the Department, has acted.  That is welcome.  The important issue now is not to lose the momentum.<\/p><p>The Minister of State stated in response to a Topical Issue debate on Tuesday night that work is under way in the Department on the PSO air services from Dublin to Donegal to launch an emergency procurement process to try to restore air services to these vital regional routes as soon as possible.  The Department plans to issue a request for quotes directly to airlines in the coming days in accordance with applicable EU rules on air service public service obligations.  It is anticipated that the emergency procurement process will be completed by early July, with a view to services being recommenced by the new operator or operators as soon as possible thereafter.  The new contract will be subject to the maximum term of seven months and will operate until EU law.  I also welcome the fact that while the emergency contract is going to be put in place the long-term service must be put in place as well, and the processes will run parallel to each other.  I commend the Minister of State on the fair play in that regard.  We must ensure that the service is going to be delivered in a timely manner.<\/p> <p>I note the Minister of State stated earlier that she was working to have the services in place by 19 July, when international travel returns.  Is that the timeframe she views for having this actually completed and services re-established in Donegal Airport?

I fully understand and appreciate the level of concern raised by all Deputies regarding connectivity to our regions, the pressure that those in the aviation sector are under and the impact on all of those who have lost their jobs.  I can assure all of those involved in the sector that the Government is fully committed to helping the sector get back on its feet.  There will be no cliff edge in the horizontal supports that have been available from the start of the pandemic to this industry.  The Government will continue to monitor and review the direct supports to the airports and any further supports that may be considered necessary, as we have acknowledged in the economic recovery plan.  I recognise also the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of the supports beyond 2021.  In this context, the Government will continue to monitor and consider what further supports may be needed to help all regional airports, including Shannon and Cork, as part of the upcoming Estimates process.<\/p>  <p>  A recent report from the Central Bank on Covid-19 and the public finances in Ireland outlined that the fiscal support package introduced in Ireland was large in a euro area context, with the increase in primary Government spending in Ireland the second highest in the euro area in the first three quarters of last year.  The report found that the fiscal measures introduced have mitigated the impact of the pandemic on households, firms and the broader economy.  This supports the Government&rsquo;s policy of providing horizontal financial supports with a view to mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the broader economy.  The Government is confident that this strategy will facilitate a speedy recovery of all sectors, including aviation, as soon as restrictions are lifted.  As I mentioned earlier, the programme for Government acknowledges the value of aviation in supporting economic development, international connectivity and tourism via our airports.  Getting international travel back up and running is vital for the continued economic well-being of this country and will continue to be a priority for me and this Government.<\/p>  <p>  I hear what Deputies have said in regard to antigen testing.  As I said in my opening statement, I and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will continue to engage at every level across government to ensure that all options in regard to testing are considered which strike the right balance between protecting public health and protecting our economy.  We will continue to be guided by the Department of Health and NPHET in regard to Covid-19 testing and how it might be used in settings, including in regard to international travel.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputies that the Government is committed to supporting the regions and regional connectivity, and that is why we have moved quickly to seek to reinstate these services lost to Donegal and Kerry, about which I share the concerns of Deputies, as well as committing to renewing the PSO services on these routes under a new contract for up to a further four years.  The funding that has been made available to these airports in 2021 is a clear indication of the importance the Government attaches to airports being well-positioned to weather the current crisis for the recovery and growth into the future.  It is worth noting that the capital funding of &euro;900,000 to Donegal Airport, &euro;2.2 million to Knock Airport and &euro;1.7 million to Kerry Airport, which I announced on 19 April under the regional airports programme, represented funding of 100% of all eligible projects submitted by airports this year.  In addition, I have asked airports to give further consideration to projects with a sustainability focus, which will help expedite airports&rsquo; efforts to reduce emissions in line with the goal to move towards carbon neutrality.  These additional projects submitted are currently being evaluated by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the devastating impact of Covid-19 on Shannon Airport, like all airports in Ireland and around the world, and the importance to the mid-west of having strategic routes from Shannon Airport to London Heathrow, a European hub airport and the US.  Prior to the pandemic, Shannon Group was delivering on its commercial mandate, improving profitability and recording strong growth in its commercial property company.  While the impact of Covid-19 left Shannon Group in a very vulnerable position, the general Covid-19-related supports put in place by the Government and the specific Government supports targeted at Shannon Airport, which totalled some &euro;30 million in 2020 and 2021, should serve to secure the position of the group and aid its recovery.<\/p>  <p>  In a positive development, I can advise Deputies that Ryanair resumed scheduled air services at Shannon Airport on 1 June, and flights operating include those to the UK, Poland, Lithuania and Spain.  Shannon Airport has also advised me that Ryanair services from the airport will increase from July.  Regarding the restoration of other routes and the introduction of new air services, I understand the Shannon to London Heathrow route operated by Aer Lingus is expected to be back in September.  I also understand Aer Lingus has indicated its intent to come back on transatlantic routes and that Shannon Airport is working hard to get its transatlantic routes back.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the appointment of a new chair to the Shannon Group, a selection process is under way by the Public Appointments Service, which is expected to bring forward a shortlist of suitable candidates to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for his consideration shortly, and the appointment will be made as soon as possible thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government commitment seeks to ensure that local development plans are developed to stimulate economic activity for those areas that were expecting economic development arising from new fossil fuel infrastructure and, as part of this, consider the potential of the Shannon Estuary in terms of regional economic development across transport and logistics, manufacturing, renewable energy and tourism, and develop a strategy to achieve this potential with support from the Exchequer.  The T&aacute;naiste will make an announcement on this programme for government commitment to establish a Shannon Estuary task force over the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the anticipated closure of the airport in Cork from 12 September to 22 November this year will be highly disruptive for many in the Cork region.  However, taking a range of factors into consideration, Cork Airport decided that the optimal approach for completing this project would be to close the airport for ten weeks, rather than risk restricting works to night-time hours only, which would push out the project&rsquo;s delivery timescale to nine months.  The airport has engaged extensively with airline customers and stakeholders on this issue, and the vast majority of those stakeholders were in support of the airport&rsquo;s approach.  Delivering the runway project over the shorter time period is safer in both construction and aeronautical terms, will have the lowest impact on passengers and airlines, and is the most cost-effective option when compared with the alternative night-time closure option.  The runway upgrade is a complex and large project that also involves a full renewal of all the airside electrical systems.  Given the costs involved, the project falls within the scope of the public spending code and, given the detailed procurement process involved for an infrastructure project of this scale and the requirements under the public spending code, it would not be feasible to bring this project forward any earlier than is currently planned.<\/p>  <p>  While I know this sector has greatly suffered and is continuing to be impacted by Covid-19, I am optimistic that the aviation sector can and will bounce back, and will help to drive Ireland's economic recovery and facilitate a return to growth as restrictions are gradually eased in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700054#FFF00200","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Impact of Covid-19 on People with Disabilities within the Education and Health Sectors: Statements","time":1623947100,"counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700054#FFF00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1623947100,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The Ministers of State, Deputy Madigan and Deputy Rabbitte, are sharing time.

Covid-19 has impacted all parts of society, but we must remember that some groups have been impacted more than others.  Those in society who require additional supports or have particular needs have found the past year to be more difficult than others.<\/p>  <p>  In opening this discussion, as Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I want to focus particularly on how Covid-19 has impacted the educational experience of those in society with additional needs.  As Members of this House are aware, the closure of schools for extended periods on two separate occasions over the past two years due to Covid restrictions has meant this has been a very difficult period for our young people and students.  These difficulties were often even more pronounced for students who have disabilities or special educational needs, who often found it harder to participate fully with remote education.<\/p> <p>For such students, changes to their normal routines and the fact that they could not access the supports they would normally receive in a school environment meant that school closures often had an even greater impact on them and their parents and guardians.  I have heard countless stories from young people and their families about how this impacted on their lives, with the fear of educational and behavioural regression being a constant feature of this period.<\/p> <p> The loss of connection with education, school staff, and friends was a very real concern.  Students with additional needs do best in school, as we know, receiving educational support in person.  I wanted to make sure that the lessons learned during the first period of school closure could lead to a more targeted response during the second period of school closure, so Government confirmed that special education should be a priority as part of school reopening earlier this year.  I worked to ensure that precedence was given to the reopening of schools for pupils who have the most complex special educational needs.  Following intense engagement with education partners, public health officials and other relevant stakeholders, including parents and school management bodies, we were able to ensure that a phased return to in-school learning for children with special educational needs could commence from early February of this year.<\/p> <p> The first cohort of pupils who returned to school were children who attended special schools.  Special schools were prioritised for the first stage of reopening, initially on a 50% capacity shared basis from 11 February.  Children in special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools formed part of the next group who were prioritised for return to school on 22 February.  Special schools reopened at full capacity on 1 March.  Pupils with special educational needs who attended mainstream classes returned to schools in accordance with the next stages of the phased reopening, between March and April.<\/p> <p> Recognising that remote learning can be especially challenging for students with complex special educational needs in mainstream education, my Department also put in place a supplementary education programme, which commenced in February, and which was designed to support the education and-or care needs of pupils with complex needs during the period of extended school closures and phased reopening.  Under the supplementary education programme, provision was made for pupils to receive five hours per week of in-person teaching or care support for four weeks.  My Department provided for a flexible approach to the use of these hours to maximise the number of students participating.  To this end, hours could be used by families at any time before 30 April 2021, including during the Easter holidays.  The Department also facilitated arrangements where school buildings were used for this programme once schools had fully reopened.<\/p> <p> The programme was structured in similar way to my Department&rsquo;s home-based summer programme.  Parents engaged either a teacher or a special needs assessment in a private arrangement.  When the programme is complete, parents return a payment claim form to my Department.  The closing date for receipt of completed payment claim forms was 14 May 2021.  To date, the Department has received approximately 13,800 payment claim forms, which demonstrated significant take-up of the programme.  The schools, their management bodies and teacher representative organisations made significant efforts to ensure that children with special educational needs could return to school at the earliest possible stage.  In doing so, they were also required to address the concerns of school staff about how school premises could reopen safely and operate in accordance with public health guidance.  I express my appreciation to everyone who was involved in working to ensure that the return to in-school learning could take place in difficult and challenging circumstances.  I recognise and appreciate the good faith of all concerned.  We all shared the same of goal of ensuring that pupils could safely return to schools.<\/p> <p> Overall, a package of nearly &euro;650 million has been provided to support the reopening of schools.  This includes funding for PPE, additional teaching posts, sanitiser, enhanced cleaning, and also funding so that schools could employ replacement teachers, SNAs and administrative staff.  In addition to prioritising pupils with special educational needs to return to school, my Department has also provided for a range of measures to support such pupils while out of school.  This included measures to support the provision of teaching support during the school closure period, the supplementary education scheme and, as I mentioned, an enhanced summer education programme which will take place this year.<\/p> <p> Guidance was provided for schools which advised schools and teachers on how to support continuity of learning for pupils with special educational needs during the school closures associated with Covid-19.  This guidance outlined how special education teachers in mainstream schools and teachers in special schools and special classes should make every effort to maintain regular contact with all of their pupils and, where appropriate, make provision for one-to-one online supports.  Schools were also provided with funding for digital support and in the two tranches of funding, totalling &euro;100 million in 2020, have been advised to prioritise supporting the purchase of devices for students who may not have access to devices for remote learning.<\/p> <p> The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, provided a range of supports for parents and schools with dedicated phone lines to support teachers and parents.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, also provided supports for schools and pupils during the school closure period and developed a range of resources for pupils and parents to support the well-being of children and young people in line with the Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2018-2023.  NEPS psychologists also developed advice and guidance documents for parents and students available to support the return to school, including advice on transition, coping and relaxation strategies, and managing stress and anxiety.<\/p> <p> To further take account of the fact that children with special educational needs have been significantly affected by school closures, I am delighted to have secured an expanded summer education programme this year.  The Government recently announced a package of supports to allow primary and post-primary schools to offer a summer programme for students with complex educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  The total funding available to provide summer programmes this year is up to &euro;40 million, a 100% increase on the allocation for summer programmes in 2020.  The programme was developed following extensive engagement with education stakeholders, parent and disability advocacy groups.  The programme has a few aims.  It aims to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation and promote well-being.  For those who are at key transition stages, it aims to help to ensure they continue their education journey in September, either in school, in further or higher education or in training.  The programmes on offer this summer include a new two to three week summer programme available to all schools and an expansion of the existing programmes in special schools and classes and in DEIS schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700054#FFF00500","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623947700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Is the Minister of State sharing time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700055#GGG00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1623947700,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I am not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700055#GGG00300","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1623947700,"counter":392,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's colleague will make the closing statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700055#GGG00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1623947700,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Yes.  Some programmes are being run again this year, including numeracy and literacy camps in DEIS primary schools, a school-based summer programme in primary special classes and special schools.  There will be home-based provision for students with complex needs where no school-based programme is available.  New programmes are also being provided this year.  All primary schools will have the opportunity to provide a two-week summer programme for mainstream pupils with complex needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  All post-primary schools have the opportunity to provide a two-week summer programme for students with complex needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  Similar to last year, children with complex needs who had been attending pre-schools this year, but who are entering primary school this September, are also eligible to participate in summer programmes.  This range of programmes on offer builds on the success of the expanded programmes that ran last year and incorporates feedback from education stakeholders about how to better support the programme for all involved in summer 2021.  A home-based summer programme will be available for students with complex special educational needs where schools are not providing a school-based programme.  Application forms are available from schools.<\/p>  <p>  The summer programme is intended to help as many students as possible with additional needs to benefit from in-person education over the summer to prevent regression, build key skills and confidence, and make up for the time missed earlier in the year.<\/p> <p>We are also working with school bodies and staff representatives so that uptake of this year&rsquo;s summer programme is as large as possible for the benefit of all.  The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest from primary and post-primary schools is 25 June.<\/p> <p> I have outlined the significant efforts made to ensure that pupils with special educational needs could return to in-person learning as soon as possible.  Additional supports have also been provided to mitigate the loss of learning time experienced by pupils.<\/p> <p> As the educational environment returns to normality, there will be opportunities to fully reflect on the impact of school closures on these children.  Irish and international research on the impact of the period of school closures on students has been carried out.  Understandably, much of this research, focuses on the impact on students with special educational needs and those most at risk of educational disadvantage.  My Department's inspectorate, for example, has gathered the views of parents of primary and post-primary students and students in special schools on their children&rsquo;s experiences of remote learning in 2021.  While parents of children attending primary and post-primary schools largely report positively on remote learning, some parents of children attending special schools reported negatively on those experiences.<\/p> <p> Recent research published in the UK found substantial learning loss for students at key stage 2 in reading and mathematics, along with projections that the previously existing attainment gap between advantaged and disadvantaged learners is likely to widen significantly without the provision of compensatory measures for those most at risk of educational disadvantage.  Acknowledging that this is also likely to be the case in this country, my officials are working on how best to support schools and students as they return to school in September for the coming school year.  Further information on this will be outlined in the coming weeks.  <\/p> <p> Further research will be also be required in Ireland to measure the full extent of the impact that educational disruption has had on children.  It will also need to consider which pupils have been most affected, whether the effects are temporary or long term and what measures might best alleviate or address this impact.  <\/p> <p> In the coming school year, more than 13,600 special education teachers will be allocated to mainstream schools.  They will support class teachers to address the special educational needs and learning needs of pupils who attend mainstream schools.  This year, we are also providing for two new special schools and 269 new special classes.<\/p> <p> For the 2021-22 school year, we will have 2,118 special classes, which is the largest number of special classes we have ever had and compares with 548 classes available in 2011.  Some 18,000 special needs assistants will be available to support the care needs of pupils with special educational needs in our schools.<\/p> <p> My Department will continue to prioritise investment in special education, with over &euro;2 billion due to be spent on special education this year.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to special education is clear from the resources being allocated and the progress being made.  As ever, our focus is and must always be the young people themselves.  Over recent months, we have heard these young people and their families speak about their experiences.  We must now ensure that as we, hopefully, emerge from a time of extensive Covid-19 restrictions, the educational needs of these pupils continue to be provided for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700055#GGG00600","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623948300,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Ward.<\/p>  <p>  AsIAm has published a report, entitled Every Child Counts.  It was only sent to me yesterday and I do not know if the Minister of State has had chance to see it.  It contains the results of a survey, which it is keen to indicate is just a snapshot of autism services and supports.  It surveyed the parents of children with autism.  The key findings were that two thirds of parents and guardians surveyed have had to wait two years or more to receive an autism diagnosis for their child.  Over 50% felt very dissatisfied with the HSE support services for their autistic children.  Almost four in five said they were not in receipt of any support from either the early intervention or school age teams.  <\/p>  <p>  The survey was carried out over the past 15 months and therefore incorporates the Covid pandemic period.  The results are alarming and it is important for the D&aacute;il to consider progressing an autism strategy and establishing an autism committee.  It is extremely important as the number of children with autism seems to be increasing all the time and the supports to deal with it are not available.  <\/p>  <p>  The report also referred to respite.  Respite provision was poor prior to the pandemic and has been non-existent during it.  Respite provision needs to resume and it needs to be provided in every county.  It needs to be provided for children and adults, separately but simultaneously.  Some &euro;5 million was provided in the budget to open nine additional respite houses over the course of the year.  I know one was opened in Limerick which is welcome.  I am not sure of the status of the others.  Will they be opened this year?  It is essential that they are.<\/p>  <p>  Separate emergency respite provision is required which will not interrupt the pre-booked respite provision being made available to families.  Many families tell me that they have their child booked into respite care, have booked a couple of nights away and then they get a phone call the following day asking them to take their child out of respite and their break is interrupted.  That cannot be allowed to happen; it is not fair to families.  Respite needs to be person centred and it needs to be provided and designed with the interests of the child or individual at heart.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State mentioned, children have missed out on a considerable amount of school contact time between last year and this year.  Children with additional needs have been impacted more greatly than others, resulting in regression in many cases.  I welcome all the programmes that the Minister of State indicated have been offered.  The enhanced summer provision programme that has been put in place is very welcome.  However, parents have been telling me of difficulty with provision in some schools and that they are very disappointed that their local school may not be providing the service because of insufficient staff.  Has this issue been dealt with?  If the staff in the school are not willing to provide the service, can staff from another school do so or can undergraduate staff be brought in to provide the service?  <\/p>  <p>  The set allocation has not been reviewed for the past two years because of the Covid pandemic.  While this does not affect some schools and might, in fact, benefit others, new schools or progressing schools are missing out.  They have appealed and I ask the Minister of State to look at those appeals and ensure that extra provision is put in place in those schools prior to autumn resumption of school.  <\/p>  <p>  Day services for people with disabilities and people with dementia were severely interrupted last year.  I previously welcomed the fact that day services for people with disabilities reopened in September and stayed open during subsequent lockdowns, obviously not at full capacity.  I hope they will resume at full capacity very soon given that by now most of the service users and staff will have been vaccinated.  Dementia sufferers have not been able to access their services and it is extremely important that they are reopened if staff are fully vaccinated.  As I presume most of the older cohort of the population are vaccinated, it should be safe to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  The Indecon report on the disability capacity review has not yet been published.  It is imperative to get that report to allow us to plan and know where and how to fund disability services for the future.  When will that report be published?  Will it be published in time for the budget preparation?  The Oireachtas disability group and the IWA have called for that to happen.  We have a deficit in disability services that needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700056#HHH00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1623948300,"counter":396,"content":"<p>The pandemic has disrupted education for all, but it has had further implications for children with disabilities.  As the Minister of State said, it has disproportionately affected this group of children.  As schools turned to remote learning, countless parents have seen their children regress.  Many children with disabilities need the structure that schools offer.  Others need interventions that are difficult to provide remotely, such as hands-on instruction, occupational therapy and special needs assistance.<\/p> <p>The loss of school for this group of children was much more than a denial of education.  It was the loss of meaning, routine, therapy, socialisation, peer interaction and fun.  The Children's Ombudsman has said that it is no surprise that stories of regression and challenging behaviour were arriving into his office during every lockdown and that parents were crying out for schools to be reopened for this group of children.  In my area of Dublin Mid-West, parents have contacted me seeking to obtain additional supports in school because of their children's regression.  Parents whose children attend a semi-mainstream class in St. Peter Apostle National School in Neilstown are adamant that their children now need to be in a special educational class because of how far they have regressed.  The problem is that the school does not have the capacity to provide this.  Will the Minister of State look at how she can support families such as these?<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will answer some of the questions I am about to ask in her closing statement.  As a result of this year's cyberattack, it is very difficult to obtain some of the information for which we are looking.  One of the issues I have consistently raised with the Minister of State is that of children having timely access to assessments of need.  Earlier this year, the HSE and the Minister of State's Department streamlined these assessments to ensure they reach as many children as possible.  I am a bit in the dark.  I do not know if this is working because we have not been given the information from the HSE.  I was very critical at the beginning and I was afraid that this was a box-ticking exercise and that children were to be moved from one service to another without actually getting the services they need.  In the absence of these data from the HSE, I hope the Minister of State will be able to circulate a report in this regard or to refer to the matter in her closing statement and let us know how it is going, if it is working and if children are getting the help they need in a timely manner.<\/p> <p> Another barrier to children accessing disability services in my area of Dublin Mid-West is the lack of primary care centres.  There are 120,000 people living in my area, which includes Clondalkin, Lucan, Palmerstown, Rathcoole, Newcastle, Saggart and Brittas.  Does the Minister of State know how many primary care centres there are to serve this population?  One does not need a calculator.  There is not one.  Construction started on one in Clondalkin very recently.  The one in Rowlagh has been held up as a result of a dispute between the Departments of Health and Education.  This has been ongoing for some time.  There is no sign of the proposed primary health care centres in Adamstown or Lucan.  For children to access the services they need, the Government needs to put the infrastructure in place for these disability teams.<\/p> <p> I will make one last point.  I am one of the more than 800,000 Irish people who are living with a neurological condition.  Most people who have neurological conditions will require neuro-rehabilitation services at some point.  These services are critical in supporting recovery and preventing disability for those with a neurological condition.  I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2007 and can speak at first hand of my experiences and difficulties in accessing neurological services in a timely manner and the impact these difficulties had on me as an individual and on my family, my job and my employment at that time.<\/p> <p> Earlier today I met with representatives of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, who had serious concerns about the lack of progress in the implementation of the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy.  It is nearly a year since the current programme for Government was published.  This programme included a commitment to implement this strategy.  The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in serious pent-up demand for rehabilitation services for new and existing neurological needs in addition to creating further demand for rehabilitation to meet the needs of patients with long Covid.  The HSE national steering group with responsibility for the implementation of the neuro-rehabilitation framework has not met at all in 2021.  This is not good enough.  The Minister of State's Government has promised neuro-rehabilitation teams in each of the nine community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas across Ireland.  So far, two have been delivered.  There are 23,000 people waiting for neurology appointments as we speak.  With the onset of Covid, this waiting list will only get longer.  We need political will and we need to start putting things in place to resolve this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700056#HHH00300","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623948900,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I welcome the Ministers of State.  I am a little bit taken aback by the Minister of State's address as it appeared she wanted to inform the House that everything is basically okay, that everything is fine, that Government is on top of things and that there is nothing to see here.  Anybody who understands the education system well, and particularly how it interacts with the health system, will know that there were very significant problems before the pandemic.  If the Minister of State were to stand up, acknowledge that and say that she appreciates that there are issues and that she is going to work with every agency, with the Opposition and with families and communities to resolve them rather than read out a list of ticked boxes to show how great the Government is doing, we might actually believe she is in a position to bring about great changes.<\/p>  <p>  I will fill her in on the reality of my constituents, who are waiting years for their children to get basic assessments and basic interventions.  They do not have a right to automatic placement in a primary school.  They get a list of schools from the special educational needs organiser and are basically told to fend for themselves.  We also have an issue which has become quite profound over the course of the pandemic.  As I hope the Minister of State will understand, children with special educational needs have been profoundly affected by the lack of in-school learning.  On that basis, although the pandemic is clearly not the Government's fault, it is the Government's responsibility to respond with a fund, investment or vision to catch these children up.  We are not going to heal the scars of the last year and a half with a summer programme.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned this to the T&aacute;naiste earlier.  Two weeks ago, the Minister for Education announced her intention to establish a multimillion euro catch-up fund for children for next year.  There has been an enormous political row in the UK over the level of the catch-up fund announced in England.  The person who was responsible for distributing that fund resigned on the basis that it was only &pound;1.4 billion.  It appears that this Government feels that, if we can make a little bit of an investment over the summer, we need no real radical overhaul of how the system presents itself to families and to children and no radical overhaul or investment with regard to class sizes, what children are going through or the level of campaigning parents have to undertake, and the exhaustion they have to experience, to get basic services.  All of us, including myself, are dealing with parents in our constituencies.  I have been speaking to Senator Bacik about parents in Dublin 2, Dublin 4, Dublin 6 and Dublin 6 West who cannot get a unit for their children.  The State seems unable to stand up for these families or to interact proactively with patron bodies to ensure children can get access to these services in the areas they are from.  I suggest to the Minister of State that there are major holes in the system and that they existed before the pandemic.  What we need from Government is a multimillion euro investment in the education system that will attempt, first of all, to repair the scars of the last year and a half and, second, will move us towards a system that is more reflective of the education system of a modern European republic.<\/p>  <p>  The issues I am raising are real.  The exhaustion of families is real.  The lack of services is real.  The waiting lists are real.  In my part of the world, children are waiting so long for basic interventions that they become no longer eligible for those interventions and so have to go on another waiting list.  All the while, there is a hint, sense or feeling that the system is begging people to get these services privately because they can then be taken off the list and will no longer be the system's problem.  As I am sure the Minister of State will know, only a certain number of families have the means to do so.  I again suggest to the Minister of State that, rather than standing up and giving a self-congratulatory speech on how everything is going fine, thank you very much, she should realise the level of scarring in Irish society and that it will take a massive package to allow some children and families to catch up to where they would like to be.  We could then have a proper discussion with regard to where we were before the pandemic hit, when the system certainly was not serving children with disabilities or their families in any way that would be commensurate with what we should expect in a proper republic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700057#JJJ00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1623949500,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan.  I disagree with the previous speaker.  I listened to the speech of the Minister of State and I do not think it was self-congratulatory in any way.  I think it was an acknowledgement of the resources that have been put in throughout the pandemic.  Most of those contributing to this debate come from an educational background or have worked in the health services and we acknowledge that there will never be enough money to deal with some of the issues we are discussing.  It needs to be recognised that an effort has been made in the past couple of months to target the most vulnerable in society in terms of improving resources but, unfortunately, there will never be enough money, such are the difficulties we face.<\/p><p>I would welcome feedback from the Minister of State in her closing remarks on the points I wish to raise.  The first issue is that of summer provision.  Having worked in a school for the best part of 15 years, I know, as do all Members, the problems faced by parents who have to seek that assistance for their children during the summer.  All Members know the difficulties involved in getting SNAs and other staff to sign up for summer provision.  To be fair, this year the Government has tried to streamline it and make it more approachable for staff, but, unfortunately, I have heard that the uptake on the ground has been very slow.  I acknowledge the extension that has been granted up to 25 June and it is welcome for those applicants but it probably masks the fact that the uptake up to now has been very slow.  We need to have a larger think about the system and the way in which it is delivered every year because, evidently, it is very difficult to get people to sign up.  We need that to change. <\/p><p>In a related point on summer provision, there should be a portal run by the Department.  It is sad to see that some parents and schools have created <i>ad hoc<\/i>portals to get people and teachers to advertise themselves and their availability through the summer.  It may be the case that the education and training boards and the Department should be running that kind of portal. <\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position with regard to the application for summer provision.  I understand that applicants have the choice of availing of home support or school support but are not able to avail of both.  Could there be consideration of an extension of the choice available such that a child could go to school for a portion of summer provision and then avail of it at home as well?  That would open it up to greater numbers.<\/p><p>Deputy Tully referred to the Every Child Counts report published this week by AsIAm.  Evidently, two thirds of respondents are dissatisfied with the service they are receiving, while 40% stated that children regressed during the pandemic.  Unfortunately, those are the facts we need to face.  We need to pump extra resources into children, schools and the sector.<\/p><p>The Rainbow Club in Cork does great work and has recently located a building on the south side of the city after much difficulty.  It receives no departmental funding.  It pays for all the therapies and employs its own occupational therapists, other therapists and so on.  Unfortunately, the parents and children who avail of those services have to contribute towards the cost, with a charge of &euro;20 per head per therapy.  It is a service that is worthwhile and it is worth publicly funding.  The Rainbow Club is also considering a disused HSE building in Mahon.  I have written to the head of the HSE South\/Southwest Hospital Group today to inquire about that property.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, can use her good offices to ascertain whether the HSE could lease that building to the Rainbow Club.  She has probably seen coverage of the club online, especially on Twitter, including its autistic baker, Sean O'Mahoney, and its cottage community caf&eacute;.  It is doing great work with children and teaching them life skills.  That needs to be recognised through State funding. <\/p><p>I refer to autism spectrum disorder, ASD, provision nationally.I know all Members contributing to the debate are acknowledging that children have regressed in this period and it has been very challenging but I think we need to consider the overall approach to ASD schooling in mainstream schools.  The strategy and discretion that schools have need to be challenged and changed and a demand-led service needs to be brought in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700058#KKK00100","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1623949500,"counter":400,"content":"<p>In fairness to Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, he has quite elegantly covered many of the issues that have been raised with me in my constituency, so I will not duplicate that or cover the same ground.<\/p>  <p>  An issue I wish to raise that is particularly relevant to the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has responsibility for disabilities, is the need for accessibility, particularly wheelchair accessibility, at beaches throughout Ireland.  I constantly make the point that something wonderful happened during lockdown - people started to flock to beaches and the coast.  They found refuge on our beaches and coast and in our coves.  It was amazing to see that happening.  It is still happening and it will happen in the summer months while we are under existing restrictions.  Unfortunately, not everybody is able to avail of the amenity that is provided by our beaches or the incredible facilities we have on our coast and our doorsteps right across the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I would love for the State to fund the provision of accessibility measures, and particularly wheelchair accessibility, to beaches.  Ireland is dotted with thousands of beaches, but even if we were to focus on the provision of wheelchair accessibility to the many safe Blue Flag beaches, it would change people's lives.  I can testify to the fact that where wheelchair buggies are already provided, such as at the Warren beach just west of Clonakilty, they are making a significant difference.  I have witnessed the absolute joy of a child at being able to go onto the beach in one of these adapted wheelchairs and head right into the water.  It is an absolutely incredible thing to witness the joy that child got from being able to do so.  I do not think anybody should be deprived of the ability to have that experience.  I would love to see such initiatives rolled out not just at the Warren, but at beaches right across Cork and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  We in the western division of the local authority in the area I represent are lucky to have a municipal district officer who is incredibly passionate about this issue, but she needs resources and funding to put into it.  I would really love it if the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, could provide me with an update regarding where we are in terms of the provision of funding for this.  Even if it is not possible to provide wheelchair buggies, she could consider the provision of decking that splays out into the beach and would, at least, give people the opportunity to have that beach experience.  Something simple and small like that could change people's lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700058#KKK00200","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1623949500,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I wish to raise an issue related to the point raised by the previous speaker and the whole conversation around accessibility.  We have heard the issue discussed in the media in recent days but people have also contacted me on it.  In fairness, incredible work has been done in terms of facilitating outdoor dining but there has probably been a trick missed in the sense that accessibility, particularly wheelchair accessibility, was not built into it.  That should be a starting point for all such discussions into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Would it be possible for one of the Ministers of State present to deal with the issue of St. John of God day services when they are returning fire, as they say?  I know there is a process ongoing in that regard, but at what stage is the process?  There are several families, particularly in my constituency, who are somewhat worried about what the future holds.  If possible, they should be given some sort of succour that everything is going in the right direction and there will be provision of these absolutely necessary services into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Many of my colleagues, including Deputy Tully, referred to special education teaching and the allocation and the need for review.<\/p> <p>A number of school managers in my constituency have contacted me lately to say they do not have adequate provision.  We need an overall review to deal with that particular issue.<\/p> <p> There is an issue in terms of people with disabilities falling between stools.  I refer to adults who do not have the capacity to live life as the rest of us do and who may have been unlucky in not having had supportive parenting or other family supports, as a result, in some cases, of terrible tragedy.  There may also be crossover issues to do with mental health and otherwise.  It may happen that such people's care falls between disability, social care and mental health services.  We need to look at that entire process and provision across the board.  I hope to have a longer conversation with the Minister of State on this matter.  I have had a number of such cases land on my desk in the past while.  Sometimes we are giving people whatever support we can but it is a case of keeping the engine going with bale and twine.  It is not acceptable that we are failing these people.  Early interventions are being missed, which could make it much easier to deal with some of these situations.  Instead, people are left waiting until acute care is required and we all know such services are not necessarily in place.  That issue must be addressed.<\/p> <p> I have spoken to the Minister of State before about particular issues around housing provision for people with disabilities.  In particular, there are parents of children with severe disabilities who cannot avail of appropriate housing provision.  Again, this needs to be looked at across the board.  There is also the issue of the major backlog in local authorities in dealing with applications for housing adaptation grants for people with disabilities.  That needs to be reviewed because there are people with real difficulties that are not being dealt with adequately.  In fairness, it will require a multi-departmental solution.  We will probably have to look at the methodology and process around this provision across the board because it is entirely failing.  It is not just the fault of local authorities and the fact they are underfunded.  There also needs to be more interaction with the HSE and other agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700058#KKK00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623950100,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Earlier this week, AsIAm, an autism charity, published its Every Child Counts report, which found that 66% of families surveyed had to wait more than two years to access an appropriate assessment for their child.  More than three quarters of those surveyed said they were not in receipt of any support from the HSE's early intervention team, school age team or the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The last finding I want to mention, which is crucial to this debate, is that 40% of respondents' autistic children had regressed during the Covid-19 pandemic, either in terms of their educational or interpersonal skills.  This would suggest to every right-minded person that the claim made by the Minister of State that everything is okay is clearly not true.  Things were not okay before the pandemic and they certainly were exacerbated during it.  In a post-pandemic situation, we are a long way from where we need to be.<\/p>  <p>  I have noticed a narrative developing that is deeply worrying.  It is that the trauma, isolation and regression experienced by many parents and their children with disabilities over the course of the pandemic are no longer an issue.  A summer programme does not even come close to being enough to address the harm that has taken place.  I have stated repeatedly that a return to the pre-pandemic normal is not good enough.  There was a wave of unmet needs before the onset of Covid for people with disabilities and those needs have only grown as a result of the pandemic.  We need to have more ambition and stop being bystanders when it comes to advancing the rights of people with disabilities.  We are waiting 17 years for the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004.  That is an extraordinary indictment of this State.  What good is it to have a legal requirement that an assessment of needs be provided within three months of receipt of an application if less than 10% of assessments are completed on time?  Where are the ambition, the resources and funding to address this issue adequately?<\/p>  <p>  In my role as party spokesperson for education, instead of conversations about enhancements and additional resources for students with disabilities, all I am hearing is that things will be maintained and frozen going into the next academic year.  I want to highlight a specific issue in this regard, namely, the provision of SNAs and the exceptional review process.  Schools are facing a cliff edge in September in regard to special needs resources.  For schools in my constituency, this is a conversation that is ongoing and an issue about which school principals have been contacting me.  The Government line is that nothing will be taken away for the 2021-22 school year.  One can conclude from this that nothing additional will be given.  Is that not correct?  In a reply to a parliamentary question I submitted, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, confirmed that existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools as at 30 April last will be maintained and will roll over into the next school year.  What good is that to the many schools that are set for an increase in the number of students with special needs who require the support or partial support of an SNA?  They include students who are transitioning to secondary school, for example, who have had an extraordinarily difficult fifth-class year and a sixth-class year that was completely upturned.  However, we are still being told that the basic pre-Covid provision of SNAs, which was inadequate before the pandemic, will be retained and will be adequate for the coming school year.  It is farcical.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a dangerous space in this regard.  The process of exceptional reviews is not fit for purpose.  There is no timeline for the process and secondary schools will not have completed their applications until after September, when the special educational needs organiser visits.  Many primary school students with disabilities whose fifth-class and sixth-class years were marked by Covid will not have the resources they need in place for them in September.  If I can ask the Minister of State to do one thing, it is to address this issue.  Many schools are facing a cliff edge and the trauma for students that was exacerbated throughout the pandemic will be made worse.  The gap in educational access and dignity will be widened further in September.  If only one action comes out of this debate, let it be that this issue is addressed.  What is happening is morally reprehensible and I strongly encourage the Minister of State to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700059#LLL00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1623950100,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Hourigan.  I welcome this discussion on the impact the Covid pandemic has had on people with disabilities and their families.  I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies Madigan and Rabbitte, for giving their time to the debate this evening.  In particular, I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and her staff to prioritise people with disabilities during the pandemic.  She has been available to Deputies on all sides of the House at all times and this is greatly appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the Covid pandemic has had a devastating impact on people with disabilities, their families and service providers.  It was encouraging to see services resume in special schools from 22 February last, as well as in-class teaching from March.  I pay tribute to everyone working in the sector, particularly teachers, SNAs, transport and sanitation workers and everybody who made school facilities safe to reopen.  However, I have been made aware of difficulties arising for certain healthcare workers and others who are still awaiting their second AstraZeneca vaccination.  I ask the Ministers of State to raise that matter with the HSE.  I am aware that a statement was issued some days ago in this regard but it is important that we see the issue resolved as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has gone to considerable lengths to meet with parents' groups in my constituency, such as the parents of children in Carmona Services and she organised a meeting with stakeholders earlier this week.  That was greatly appreciated.  Perhaps she will refer in her closing statement to the implementation of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme in special schools, with particular reference to the need to ensure services remain based on site.<\/p>  <p>  The cyberattack the HSE has had to grapple with in the shadow of the pandemic also has had a devastating impact on its ability to provide services.  For us in this House, it has had a particular impact on our ability to represent our constituents.  It is imperative that the parliamentary question system, as it interacts with the HSE, be restored as soon as possible.  Will the Minister of State speak to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, about this?  It is important that the facility resumes as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In the time remaining, I want to refer to the July provision.  While the recent announcement is crucial and very welcome, I agree with my colleague, Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, that an online portal might be the best way to proceed.<\/p> <p>It is cumbersome, particularly for the schools that do not offer the service.  Parents have to seek July provision at home.  That presents its own challenges.  For many parents with children who have disabilities, it is tough for them to continuously go out and seek services.  If services were available easily at the click of a button, or indeed if it were easier to apply for them, it would be easier for all of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700059#LLL00300","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623950700,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I am going to speak about a particular group this evening, namely, that comprising children with visual impairment.  I lived the experience over the last 15 months with my own eight year old.  Other Deputies have mentioned the AsIAm report.  One could pick any group and speak to its specific needs, or indeed any child, because every child is unique and will have experienced the pandemic in a particular way.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth saying at the outset that my experience - and indeed that of many parents - was that the staff at the school really tried their hardest.  Visiting teachers, resource teachers, class teachers and the incredible SNAs that are almost part of the family did heroic work during the pandemic to bridge the gap that Covid-19 threw up and exposed in our services.  NGOs did a huge amount of work for children with visual impairment.  The National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, provided support, advocacy and advice.  Parents groups such as F&eacute;ach and ChildVision in Drumcondra did great work.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic had an impact in two areas.  It had an impact on and caused disruption to children's academic lives, but for children with disabilities, it also had a huge impact on the social, developmental and emotional side of their lives, which they access through the school environment.  It is important that we have these debates and bring it all out into the light now in case it happens again - and I really hope that we do not see another pandemic or go into a third wave lockdown. The pandemic also exposed failings in our own system and in education delivery and services.<\/p>  <p>  For a child with visual impairment, much of the academic side that they access in school is based on assistive technology.  For a child in primary school in particular, assistive  technology includes CCTV, and reveal technology.  These are big bulky items that the schools do not necessarily send home.  Indeed, I am not sure they should be sending them home.  Even if they could, certainly in my constituency, most families do not have the space to set up a large, permanent screen-type learning environment.  Therefore, during the pandemic, most children in mainstream education with visual impairment were required to do much of their learning online and through Zoom.  Many children with visual impairment have other diagnoses.  For example, they might have hearing difficulties or  other complications.  Zoom learning is simply not workable.  It is very difficult to get a child to concentrate on a Zoom call when they cannot see the screen and they are not having the same experience as their peers in their class.  That has a huge knock-on effect.  The pandemic really brought to the fore the need for a greater focus in educational settings on the expanded core curriculum.  It is an issue that the NCBI highlights often.  It encompasses everything on the curriculum except the academics.<\/p>  <p>  I have an excellent experience of visiting teachers and they are fantastic.  However, their focus and their task from the Department is academic in nature.  They are excellent at supporting the other elements of the curriculum, but it would be even better if there was a renewed focus on an expanded core curriculum for children who are visually impaired.  It includes the social and occupational therapy aspects, such as making friends and children taking responsibility for going to the toilet by themselves.  To do that, one very clear thing that we could do would be for the Department of Education and the NCSE to recognise the NCBI as a complementary service provider so that it could support children, parents, families, visiting teachers and the schools themselves in that more social side of how education is experienced by children with visual impairment.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters earlier, we had a very clear discussion with the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on the need for better data.  There is a huge gap between the data on self-declared vision impairment in the census and the number of children in our educational system who are receiving support.  That simply does not add up.  We need to get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700060#MMM00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1623950700,"counter":407,"content":"<p>In 2019, the national autism empowerment strategy was passed here unanimously.  Families with autism have to fight for absolutely everything.  If we had a strategy, it would ensure that we have enough neurodiverse places in our schools.  With the strategy, we would have proper supports for children in secondary school.  My colleague, Senator Boylan, and I recently met with Autism Equality Dublin Bay parents group.  They raised with us the fact that one school in Sandymount, the Shelleybanks Educate Together School, will not be opening an ASD class in September.  It is really difficult to understand how any school in this day and age would not want to have an ASD class.  I understand that the Department has made resources available to the school and the capacity is there, yet it will still not open a class.  This is unacceptable and shameful.  I think the Minister of State would agree with that.  I call on the Minister of State to directly intervene and compel the Shelleybanks Educate Together School in Sandymount to open an ASD class in September.<\/p>  <p>  Like every community, we have children with additional needs.  Every morning they should be able to walk through the school gates with their brothers and sisters.  It is ironic that the school's name contains the phrase \"Educate Together\", yet it refuses to educate all children together.  The Involve Autism advocacy group has harvested the facts to show how much is being spent on bussing children out of their communities in Dublin 6 and 6W.  The lack of ASD class places in these two communities is shocking.  There are 20 schools in Dublin 6 and 6W and there are no ASD classes in Dublin 6.  Despite the section 37A process, there are no ASD classes in the area.  The Minister of State needs to intervene and compel schools to open additional needs classes in Dublin 6 and 6W.  No amount of resistance from the board of management of the Shelleybanks Educate Together School can be tolerated.  A lack of resources cannot be used as an excuse.  I do not believe that it is an excuse.  The lack of will to provide the classes by the school and the board of management is the biggest obstacle, at board level and political level.<\/p>  <p>  This issue does not only impact on primary schools, it also impacts on secondary schools.  The national autism impairment strategy would address this deficit.  We need ministerial action and intervention with the schools that are pushing back against families and children with autism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700060#MMM00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1623950700,"counter":408,"content":"<p>We have had debate on disability services and the knock-on effect of the pandemic on them many times in the past 17 or 18 months.  It has been a grim 18 months for society as a whole but, in other ways, it has been enlightening to see people pulling together in a time of need.  I am proud of this country's spirit.  We are in a different place now to where we were in January or the previous March and April.  Images stick in my mind of really stressed parents.  The routine that they had with their children disappeared overnight.  That has had a detrimental effect not only on the children's lives but also on family life.<\/p>  <p>  The good news is that educational and care settings have largely been reopened.  That is testament to the amazing staff who work in these facilities.  They really are heroes.  They have kept things open and going.  They have an amazing relationship with the people who use their services and their families.  That has been really good.<\/p>  <p>The loss of those routines has led to regression, however, while the lack of peer-to-peer interaction has had a major effect on the family lives of the children in question.<\/p> <p> In previous years, there have been issues with the July provision and its roll-out.  Hopefully, it will have a better run-in next month.  It is a vital service of which people are appreciative.  There have been issues with access and so forth.<\/p> <p> The long-term effects of the pandemic will probably live on for a considerable time.  It has shown the grave inequalities in certain areas in society and the fault lines which exist in the provision of some disability services.  From my experience, I know this has a significant effect on families in that when they need an intervention it is not there.  Of the several things which must come out of the pandemic, we need to address the inequalities in the provision of special education, as well as the knock-on effect with what has happened over the past 17 months.  Those who keep the show on the road have been amazing.  They have kept the flag flying in the most adverse circumstances.  They are heroes and I commend them fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700060#MMM00400","speaker":"1565","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623951300,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to both Ministers of State, Deputies Madigan and Rabbitte, as well as to their teams for their commitment to the disability sector throughout the pandemic.  I also want to place on record my admiration for the staff and management in the disability sector who put service users front and centre throughout what has been a national crisis.  This year, just under 25% of the total education budget will be invested in supporting children with special needs education.  While it is hugely welcome, I contend it is money well spent and certainly a budget that we need to see scaled over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding special education support services and the Phoenix Centre in Longford town, I am anxious we return to full staffing levels there as soon as possible.  It is an issue which has dogged the service in recent years.  Many of the staff continued to provide support services to children throughout the pandemic, even though they were transferred over to Covid testing duties.  That reflects their commitment to the service.  It is vital the service is fully staffed and we double down on our commitment to the most vulnerable and those who have probably paid the heaviest price throughout Covid.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased work has continued on the new special education primary school at St. Christopher's in Longford town throughout Covid.  Thankfully, it will open in September.  The new school will include two new classrooms and will take the total student population to 36.  There is a new autism class and also a class for young children with severe to profound special needs.  All the children in these two classes will have significant care needs across the sensory, medical and physical spectrum.  Of the 12 students, nine will come to the school with a recommendation for SNA support.<\/p>  <p>  As it stands, however, the two classes are classified as per the special needs unit in our local schools.  In terms of staffing, therefore, that will be one teacher and two SNAs.  In total for the two classes, that will be two teachers and four SNAs.  Needless to say, school management and the principal, Sheila Dinnegan, are in constant contact with their special educational needs organiser, SENO.  The indications are that they may well get an additional SNA for each of the two classrooms.  However, they will be still short a further three SNAs to provide an adequate service.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the class for children with severe to profound needs, four of the children are wheelchair users, two are flight risk and all will necessitate full-time SNA support.  The fact that the allocation of SNAs for their classes is the same for special units in our local schools fails to take account of this school's unique and challenging profiles.  Many of the pupils who will attend are ASD and also have profound intellectual disabilities.  Two of the pupils are PEG-fed with no head or body movement control, while two pupils have an epilepsy diagnosis, one with severe epilepsy.<\/p>  <p>  It will be a proud day for County Longford when the new school opens in September. The people of Longford take a great pride in St. Christopher's.  They also take a personal and passionate interest in its future and the well-being of its much loved pupils and service users.  God willing, the Ministers will be able to visit the Holy Land for the school's official opening later this year.  This new build is an outstanding investment in special education.  It certainly sets the bar in terms of the Government's commitment to special education.  I have contacted the offices of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, earlier on this issue.  Will the Minister of State ensure that a state-of-the-art special needs education centre is given the staffing level it requires to ensure the best possible start in life for these 36 wonderful young people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700061#NNN00200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1623951300,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate.  The quality of the debate has been good.  I listened with interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan's opening remarks.  I would make one exception, however.  It is unwelcome to hear a specific board of management named on the floor of the D&aacute;il and for a suggestion to be made that the Government pressurises a board of management.  Having served on a board of management myself in a voluntary capacity, I would have found it very unwelcome in my own situation.<\/p><p>It has been an immensely challenging time for our entire society.  For the Ministers in question, it has been extremely difficult to sail these waters and to make sure that provision for some of our most vulnerable children is kept in place in a meaningful way.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, referred to the ongoing research about the impact of school closures, particularly the different impact it will have on disadvantaged students.  The recognition of and commitment to research is very welcome.  We need to act on those findings to remediate any damage to children's education and to ensure that we do not see a lost generation on foot of this pandemic.<\/p><p>There is lost time on top of already long waits for interventions such as autism diagnoses, early intervention, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  Notwithstanding the expansion of the summer programme outlined in the opening statement, I just want to read out a communication I had from an extremely committed teacher who is an expert in the area of July provision.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe home tuition is the same as last year with not one single new incentive to help staff involved that are offering to final year students.  This is of no help to our children with complex needs.  Pay is still lower for primary teachers in comparison to secondary, even though we are equally qualified and, in some cases, more so.  SNA pay rates remain inadequate.  They would get paid more for waiting on tables in a coffee shop.  The pay date is a day earlier than last year so teachers are still waiting months for pay.  This is of no use to non-permanent or student teachers as they will then be ineligible for social welfare.  The 28th of October is just too long for work carried out through July and August, particularly when many of us will be spending plenty to provide resources, trips lunches and petrol for the children who we are working with.<br \/><br \/>The final problem is supplementary provision completed in April.  We still have no pay date for that.  I have had two teachers withdraw from the July provision due to this already.  The problems with previous years' programme were clearly and easily fixed.  Instead of fixing what was broken, it has been expanded with no actual changes.  The problem with the expansion is that staff may now opt to take children with less needs rather than taking children for whom the programme was originally set up.  I know of two SNAs with 15 and 16 years of experience who have opted out of the July provision owing to pay. <\/blockquote>  <p>What I hear from this is an extremely dedicated educator who is suffering from fatigue.  We know our educators want the very best for the children who are in their charge, none more so than the educator I have just quoted.  We need to earn back their goodwill.  We need to acknowledge the difficulty of the year that they and the children in their care have had.<\/p><p>Tangential to this discussion, I want to acknowledge the work of the Chair of the education committee, Deputy Kehoe, in guiding an extensive exploration of bullying in schools.  One of the themes which has emerged is that Covid has had a significant impact on our wider schoolgoing population.<\/p> <p>We have seen an explosion, in particular as we move to online learning, of cyberbullying.  It is very important and correct that we are focused here on children with disabilities but as we move out of this pandemic we also need to look to the mental health of our young children and people who have experienced such a difficult time during the past 16 months.

As a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, and along with the Minister of State and other Deputies who have spoken earlier, I believe we are doing good work on this committee.  It is well supported by the Ministers and Ministers of State and also by the staff.  We had a meeting this morning on various issues with Department officials.<\/p>  <p>  We are discussing the issue of disabilities and Covid-19 and the full impact that it has had.  I could, no more than the Minister of State who is from the same constituency as me, spend my evening going through the calls that we have received over the past 15 months from parents and families who went through such a torrid time through no fault of anybody other than that of Covid-19.  Some of the issues that came to mind when I was preparing for this debate were that in some cases parents or families felt that there was total isolation, a sense of abandonment and a sense that families were on their own as a result of the closure of services.  It was, and continues to be, a very difficult experience for service users and their families.  When we think about that and look at where we are now, as we now go through a phase which is, hopefully, the most positive of the last 15 months and move back to what should be a near-normal living experience again for everybody, there is a potential, an opportunity and also a duty on us to ensure that we do things right.  <\/p>  <p>  We were all caught off guard when the pandemic came in and during it.  There were things that we never contemplated would happen and did happen.  The suffering that people endured right throughout society and the sacrifices that people made were never things have were on our agenda when we were out campaigning in the last general election not too long ago.  <\/p>  <p>  We have to be sure of certain things now as to the July provision, as it is called.  It was a major concern and the struggle to reopen education for special needs children was not handled very well.  Many families suffered in silence.  There are still scars within families today about what happened and there is more than a fear as to what is going to happen in the future.  A great deal of money has been spent and they wonder where the money will come from to look after their children and family members.  <\/p>  <p>  The first thing we need to ensure is that the July provision is available to all families who want it this year.  There can be no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;buts&rdquo; or &ldquo;ands&rdquo;.  The biggest issue is the suffering that people have endured because of the regression caused by the pandemic and the absence of the prioritisation of a contingency plan for people with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  We are coming out of the pandemic at present and the opportunity is now there for the State to put people with disabilities at the centre of this journey out of Covid-19 to ensure that not one of these people are left on their own or left behind again.  Funding is required to implement change and that funding needs to be given to the people who need it.  It cannot get lost in translation.  Announcements of funding are fine but the people who need it need to see that the funding is coming quickly rather than perhaps two years later, when a great amount of schemes have to be put in place.  There are too many gaps in the funding which is also unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Respite services are crucial in addressing the regression caused by the loss of services.  It is crucial that additional respite services are provided and located where they are needed and accessible to families.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware that we do not have any overnight respite services for children in Galway at present.  It has been like that for a long time and it is not because of Covid-19.  We need to address that.  We need to ensure that children can remain within their own county and do not have to go to Limerick or other places for a night&rsquo;s respite.<\/p>  <p>  Early intervention is still not fully resourced and is still in transition, leaving parents having to battle every step of the way for what is a human right.  Waiting times for assessment of needs also needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The mental anguish suffered by parents and families waiting for appointments is an indictment of this failure and of the lack of resources.  This has not happened just today, it has been going on for years and is a failure of the State for many decades.  At the moment there are approximately 1,400 assessments overdue.<\/p>  <p>  The ratification and implementation of the optional protocol of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the convention itself needs to be done.  The official in the relevant section of the Department told me today that it will be done as soon as humanly possible.  When I pressed him for a date he could not give me one.  I accept that but we need to get a date sooner rather than later.  There is no need for us to get it locked up in legislation or whatever else.  <\/p>  <p>  We also need to ensure that when we still look across the nation and that when we finish in this D&aacute;il we have done something right for people with disabilities.  It will take money but I do not believe it is a cost.  It is an investment in our citizens and in our children and we should make every effort to do that.

The Covid-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted everyone&rsquo;s lives.  Its effects vary considerably for people of different race, ethnicities and income levels.  What has been the impact on people with disabilities?  Children and teenagers, for example, with a wide range of developmental, physical and behavioural needs have been very severely impacted.  Ongoing harm caused by the pandemic or rather caused by the Government&rsquo;s inaction, or actions as has been said earlier, has been especially evident for people with disabilities.  Disruptions in education, employment, healthcare and social services have been amplified.  Parents took on full-time care-giving roles while also stepping into new roles as special educators, speech therapists, behavioural therapists and more.

There should not be any real hassle in getting this but our systems are cumbersome.  On the issue of school bus tickets, the mess and mayhem is starting again as happens year after year.  We have a dysfunctional Department of Education which is not capable of sorting out this kind of thing.<\/p>  <p>  Programmes and social lives have been curtailed.  Many people who have intellectual or physical disabilities require highly specialised, and indeed, one-to-one programmes.  They need direct support to be safe, to learn, to work or to perform daily living skills. Some may have more difficulty using technology or learning and working in a virtual world.  For many, their social life is solely through schools, employment or community programming.  The effect, then, of limited social networks during the pandemic has been one of extreme isolation and has been especially difficult.  <\/p>  <p>  It is hard to believe that we have Ireland now signing up to United Nations treaties and conventions where there has been such a daily struggle.  My late brother was a paediatrician.  He is gone now since 2006 and he championed this.  I still meet families who miss him, the late Dr. Eddie McGrath.  The battle for people or for families with a profoundly disabled child or with whatever learning difficulties they might have is one where they have to fight for every morsel of support.<\/p> <p>There are waiting lists of 1,400 people that go on years.  It is callous.  I am not blaming the Minister of State but rather successive Governments.  We talk about it and sign up to the conventions but do nothing about it.<\/p> <p> There are deeply dysfunctional administrative staff at the HSE, Tusla and other agencies.  There are some great people within those organisations but they get frustrated, and if they try to make changes, they are stopped and told to get back into their box and do this, that and the other.  I compliment the people who did go into work and got services going, but many public servants are not pulling their weight.  They need to get back to work and unclog the system.  The agricultural system is one of many in which nothing is happening.  They are not even opening envelopes.  I refer also to the Passport Office and to the issuing of driver licences and theory tests.  Some people need licences for essential reasons; for example, if they have to drive their children with intellectual or physical disabilities to school or special playgrounds.<\/p> <p> I salute from the bottom of my heart the mothers and fathers and families, siblings and communities that are trying to work.  We in Caisle&aacute;n Nua na Si&uacute;ire set up a wonderful organisation pre-Covid called Positive Steps Together to try to put together a resource centre to give some respite to these parents.  We were going great.  There was a very enthusiastic outpouring of support and we raised a considerable sum in a short time, but along came Covid and everything fell to the ground, with no meetings, no HSE business, no interactions, no planning, no nothing.<\/p> <p> As I said earlier, given that 67 patients were in hospital on Monday last and 23 were in ICU, we need to let our country live again.  We need to get the cabal of NPHET off our backs, let ourselves live and get the Government to take control and look after everyone, but especially the people suffering with these ailments.  Let us live again.  Fear has been driven into us.  We see that now in the debate on antigen testing.  This will all come out in the international investigation I am calling for and we will see the gaping failures.  We will be reminded then of the cervical cancer smear tests and what happened in that regard.  It is shocking, but above all, the issue before the House needs to be dealt with because these people deserve it.  All Deputies have received phone calls from parents who could not cope with their anguish and everything else during Covid and throughout last year.  It is continuing 15 months later, and if NPHET gets its way, it will continue into the winter and over Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700062#OOO00500","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623952500,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, meant to give the impression that everything is okay - perhaps she did not mean to use that tone - but it certainly sounded like it.  It came across as if we should not look to the Government but rather look away.  The reality on the ground for so many parents and children is a very different experience.  I understand that both Ministers of State are working within a pandemic crisis, which is not an easy set of circumstances to respond to.  It was already a crisis, however, before the pandemic emerged.  That is down to the failure of all the previous Governments, comprising Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, during the austerity years, when these services were not properly funded.  We started, therefore, from 100 miles back, rather than being on an even keel to allow us to respond to the pandemic crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I recently tabled a few parliamentary questions, before the HSE cyberattack took place.  I asked the Minister for Health to outline the wait times for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychological services in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 for Dublin 12, an area that takes in Dublin 6W, 12 and 24.  The reply stated that under the current service structure, HSE Dublin south-west receives referrals for the area in general, which are not divided into postal code areas.  It outlined the current wait times for school-age team services provided by the HSE in south-west Dublin.  For children aged under four months, the number waiting was 38; for those aged between four and eight months, it was 60; for those aged between eight and 12 months, it was 94; for those aged between 12 and 18 months, it was 29; for those aged between 18 and 24 months, it was 40; while for those aged more than 24 months, it was 299.<\/p>  <p>  I also submitted a question regarding speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychological services in the CHO 7 area.  The response stated that since March 2020, the Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow CHO has been responding to a national pandemic that presented numerous challenges for staff and services.  It went on to state that the scale of the response included community testing, Covid-19 assessment hubs, residential unit support and, more recently, the vaccination programme, and that the Department&rsquo;s involvement in the pandemic response had resulted in increased waiting list times for the community in regard to acute services.  It stated that the waiting lists were longer than the Department would like in terms of being responsive to the needs of its service users.  The reply outlined that in regard to speech and language therapy for children under the age of four months, there were 177 on the waiting list; for those aged between four and eight months, 152; for those aged between eight and 12 months, 213; and for those aged more than 12 months, 627.<\/p>  <p>  In occupational therapy services, the number of those aged under four months who were waiting was 307; for those aged between four and eight months, 53; for those aged between eight and 12 months, 29; and for those aged more than 12 months, 719.  Similarly, in the case of psychological services, the number of those aged under four months who were waiting was 72; for those aged between four and eight months, 18; for those aged between eight and 12 months, 24; and for those aged more than 12 months, 333.  These figures are horrendous for the families living through this.  During the pandemic, many resources for these services, such as therapists and so on, were redeployed for contact tracing and so on, so there was very little progress over that period.<\/p>  <p>  The survey carried out by AsIAm was mentioned.  It found that two thirds of the parents and guardians surveyed had to wait two years or more to receive an autism diagnosis for their child, while more than 50% felt very dissatisfied with the HSE support services for their autistic child.  This is the reality.  I received an email today from a young mother.  She wrote that she was sending the email in response to a conversation we had earlier that day.  She stated that, as I would be aware, she has three children of various ages with additional needs.  Her eldest, who is 19 years old, has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit disorder, dyspraxia and anxiety disorder, and was linked in with the Linn Dara CAMHS service at Cherry Orchard Hospital.  The woman wrote that her daughter had been discharged last year after being referred to St. Martha's ward at St. James's Hospital with a view to the ward taking over her care, but this has not happened.  The ward refuses to engage with the woman's daughter and has left her limbo with regard to her medication, with her GP stating that it was not within their remit to prescribe the medication as they are not a psychiatrist.<\/p>  <p>  The woman's middle child is 13 years old and has been diagnosed with autism, dyspraxia and sensory disorder, and has not had a proper medication review in more than two years.  She was supposed to be seen in March 2020 but Covid hit and her appointment was deferred, and to date she has not been seen.  It is an autism-specific service.  She did not meet the criteria for CAMHS, the Lucena Clinic or primary care.  She has been referred to Beechpark Services in Tallaght, yet she has had no contact from that service.  The woman's youngest child is two and a half years old and has been diagnosed with T21.  She attends Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals for coronary heart disease and a heart problem called pulmonary vein stenosis.  She was linked in with speech and language therapy and physiotherapy with St. John of God Hospital because she cannot speak or walk but has been discharged from both services, with no follow-up as yet.  That is three children in one family, with the parents at their wits' end, and they have had little or no contact with the services over the past year and a half.<\/p>  <p>  This has to stop.  Last December, I listened to the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in which she stated that an interdepartmental committee on children with disabilities had been set up.  It has to be made more accountable.  It has to state publicly where the services are now, the number of therapists there are and the backlog we are dealing with, and it must report every two months on exactly how the services are being dealt with because these families cannot continue in this vein.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700063#PPP00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1623952500,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the impact that Covid-19 has had on people with disabilities.  It is great to see Government time dedicated to the discussion of disability, which indicates the Government's commitment to resolving the different issues facing people with disabilities throughout the country.<\/p> <p> If I could take a second of the Acting Chairperson's time, from a Business Committee point of view, perhaps in future we might make disability a little more front and centre during Government time as well.  This is the graveyard shift, as I call it, on a Thursday evening when many Deputies have left the premises to return to their constituencies.  It is not the first time I have stood on the floor of the D&aacute;il to deliver a speech on a Thursday evening.  I thank my colleagues who are in the House at the moment to hear it, and I am sure many Deputies are listening as they travel, but perhaps in future, somewhere along the line, we can make disabilities front and centre of a conversation, not last for delivery.  That is nothing to do with the Acting Chairperson.  It is about the Business Committee and the allocation of time.  It is unforgivable and not acceptable to the families we all speak about and represent.<\/p> <p> At the outset, I have to mention that one of the key parts of our health supports for people with disabilities is carers and the incredible work they do.  Let us not kid ourselves: without carers doing the work they do our health service would be under even more pressure than it is.  I want to state that clearly.  We are indebted to the goodwill, sweat and stress of our carers.  The physical, mental and emotional strain that goes with the role is not lost on me.  I want to acknowledge that today and put it on the record.<\/p> <p> As we all know, Covid-19 upended people from every walk of life.  Nearly every family in Ireland has been affected and too many have lost loved ones.  However, while everyone has been affected in some way, the effects have not been spread evenly across society.  Over the course of the pandemic, carers have shown how vital a national support and service they are.  Carers of people with disabilities have been disproportionately impacted as supports have ceased during the pandemic.  It would be wildly inappropriate of me to pretend that is not the case.  Today, I will present the stark facts and figures of how Covid has affected people with disabilities and its impact on specific health-funded disability services.<\/p> <p> As Deputies are aware, the HSE has been the victim of a cyberattack, meaning the following statistics can only be confirmed up to 12 May.  There have been 324 outbreaks of Covid in disability settings, 155 of them in 2021.  Most of these have been declared closed while four remain open.  There have been approximately 2,200 confirmed cases in disability settings, 1,250 of them in 2020.  Service users and staff tested positive in similar numbers.<\/p> <p> Since the cyberattack, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has provided figures for the week ending 5 June, showing one further outbreak with two cases.  It also reported four outbreaks in special schools for that week, with 17 cases in total.  These figures are provisional and subject to review.  At the outset, I offer my sincere condolences to all who have lost loved ones to Covid-19.  I know losing a loved one is a terrible experience and grieving in the midst of this pandemic has made it even tougher.  Tragically, 47 service users are known to have died, including 20 confirmed deaths since the start of this year.  However, this figure is subject to change following ongoing verification by the HPSC.<\/p> <p> The HSE reported to us that since the roll-out of the vaccination programme in disability services the number of outbreaks has fallen to a trickle, while those who have tested positive have experienced mild symptoms.  The evidence shows that people with disabilities who are exposed to Covid-19 can be at great risk of severe disease.  For this reason, I sought to ensure disability service users and staff were prioritised in the vaccination roll-out programme.  The focus has been on ensuring those who face the greatest risk of severe disease and death, the oldest and most vulnerable in society, as well as those who care for them, were vaccinated at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to inform the House that the HSE has ensured people who live in disability residential settings and those who attend day services have been vaccinated as part of the 271,000 people included in cohort 4.  These are people aged 16 to 69 at a very high risk from Covid-19 disease.  The administration of the second vaccination dose for this cohort began on the week beginning 10 May and is expected to be completed by early July.  Many people in receipt of health-funded disability services who have complex comorbidity health conditions but might not be attending day services are also in receipt of vaccinations.  They are largely included in cohort 7, which comprises people aged 16 to 59 with medical conditions and at high risk from Covid.  There are 250,000 people in this cohort, vaccinations for whom began in May and are being delivered primarily through GPs.  The first dose for this cohort is expected to be completed shortly.<\/p> <p> In March 2020, all health-funded disability day services were obliged to close.  Since then, the HSE and service provider organisations have collaborated to reimagine and reopen services for people with disabilities in line with public health guidelines.  There has been a collective response from all service providers and representative organisations to provide the best possible level of service to people with disability in line with best practice.<\/p> <p> Shortly after my appointment as Minister of State last August, I ensured the provision of disability services was deemed essential, which saw the return of many disability services.  The HSE provided guidance on Covid-19 for disability services and residential and group home facilities, which included the prevention and control of outbreaks in residential facilities.  The suite of guidance, training and support from HSE disability services, HSE public health and HIQA aligns with the recommendations of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and has mitigated the impact of Covid-19 on our service users who live in disability residential settings.<\/p> <p> I am aware many people may have concerns around the delivery of service following the HSE cyberattack.  However, most community health services, including disability services such as adult day service and children therapy services, are operating as normal.  Service users are advised to attend as normal, and many disruptions or changes to services are listed on a county-by-county basis on the HSE website.  Service users will be contacted if there any changes.  All service providers should now be delivering a minimum of 60% of pre-Covid levels of location-based support for day services.<\/p> <p> Respite services are another key area for me as they play such an important role in supporting families.  This year, we will see the opening of nine new respite centres, one in each community healthcare organisation, CHO, area.  The first of these, a centre providing respite for children in Limerick, has already started service provision.  The others are being finalised and are due to come on stream in quarter 3 and quarter 4.  I look forward to updating my colleagues on these projects as they advance.  Approximately 50% of disability respite services remained throughout the pandemic while others were temporarily repurposed as isolation facilities.  A three-phased approach is now in place where services continue to reopen over the coming months.  Funding from budget 2021 was made available to support additional respite services.  People with complex medical and clinical needs have been asked to remain at home and will receive home support, where possible, subject to risk assessment and prioritisation.<\/p> <p> On children's services, I assure Deputies that the clearing of the backlog for assessment of need continues to be prioritised.  While the number of overdue assessments of needs stood at approximately 6,500 in June 2020, through a combination of different measures, approximately 5,150 needs assessments were completed by the end of April 2021.  This means a little more than 1,300 cases are outstanding, nationally, with four CHOs having cleared their backlog.  This is an overall reduction of approximately 80%.<\/p> <p> The progressing disability services, PDS, for children and young people programme ensures vital therapeutic interventions can be delivered in the timeliest manner.  Under PDS, children's services will be reconfigured into 91 children's disability networks by the end of this month.  These teams will deliver equitable child and family-centred services for children.  Young people with complex needs are the new model of service.<\/p> <p> No Deputies during the debate addressed the pausing of the removal of therapists' posts from special schools.<\/p> <p>That meant there was the need to source 85 additional therapist positions, which I was fortunate in securing on top of the 100 other therapist posts.  That should help in the delivery of therapy intervention as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700063#PPP00300","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623953700,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I take on board what the Minister of State said on the scheduling and will pass it on to our Whip and the Ceann Comhairle to try to ensure that debates of this nature are not held at the midnight shift.

I thank the Minister of State for being here.  He will be aware of this because we have spoken of it.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste has met with the platform workers.  That is a serious issue.<\/p>  <p>  I will discuss the use of State money via our local authorities to support the practice of bogus self-employment.  I understand that is not Government policy and do not suggest it is.  However, it is happening in the construction sector at the moment in local authority projects.  The State is supporting bogus self-employment because these practices are effectively being funded through the finances of the local authorities.  We have contractors contracting business from local authorities.  They have to look for value for money, and I do not suggest that is not important but it does not have to equate to undermining workers' rights.  The practice of bogus self-employment does a number of things, chief among which is to undercut the sector employment order, SEO, rate.  We have sectoral employment orders and I understand they are liable to challenge but they are the State saying that this is the minimum.  I have payslips, some here and more that I can share with the Minister of State, which show people are not getting their pension, not paying the correct rate of PRSI and, more importantly, where the SEO rate is around &euro;19.37 per hour, they get &euro;10.50 or &euro;10.55 per hour.  These are semi-skilled and, in some cases, skilled, workers.  There are no checks and balances that I can see in place by the local authorities on the practice of bogus self-employment and undermining the SEO rate.  The contractor gets the contract and the money flows from the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I want to be constructive, work with the Minister of State and ensure this is stopped.  I doubt the Minister of State stands over this practice and I am sure he wants to stamp it out as well.  How can we ensure local authorities respect the SEO rate and there are decent terms and conditions?  Where the State spends money, it must ensure it uses its spending power to uphold workers' rights and the SEO rate and to deal with instances of bogus self-employment.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, contractors working for local authorities have been advising the chief executives of some of these local authorities of these practices and are not getting any follow-up.  If this was being dealt with at local level, I would not be raising it.  I raise it because I want to see the State take a greater hand in clamping down on bogus self-employment within the construction sector, ensuring SEO rates are upheld, proper rates of the job, pensions, etc. <\/p>  <p>  There cannot be a hands-off approach to this.  It cannot be the case that the local authorities sign the cheque and there is no follow-up on the terms and conditions.  Essentially, these people are performing a function on behalf of the State.  Where the State directly employs a nurse, carer, doctor or teacher, there is a rate for the job and that rate is respected.  There is a pension and that is paid.  That is not happening in the construction sector and I am conscious that, as the economy starts to reopen, these practices will become more and more the norm again.  I have evidence and can share it with the Minister of State.  Some mechanism needs to be in place to ensure the State is doing all it can to stamp out the practice of bogus self-employment.  That is not just legislation but following up on where the State is spending money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700065#RRR00600","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1623953700,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  She will have to forgive me because I only had notice she was going to raise bogus self-employment in the construction sector so I have no data or information on local authorities contracts.  That was not mentioned in any clarification to us.  I am happy to engage with her on that but I will have to speak more generally because that was all that was flagged to us by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak mainly on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, which has most of the enforcement in this area along with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The WRC monitors this and construction sites are a key part of its work as well.  I would gladly take any evidence or data the Deputy has, discuss it with her and feed it into officials in the various Departments.  Of course, we would follow this up and stamp this out because anywhere public money is spent we have to make sure the legislation is followed and that employees are respected and their conditions of employment through the various agreements are protected and honoured.<\/p>  <p>  False or bogus self-employment arises where an employer wilfully or wrongfully treats a worker as an independent contractor in order to avoid tax and social insurance contributions and denies the worker access to other rights which attach to employment.  Quantitative data from the labour force survey and elsewhere indicate that the prevalence of false level employment is lower than is perhaps perceived anecdotally.  The self-employed made up about 14.1% of total employment in 2020.  This is consistent with the average levels of self-employment within the EU and does not, of itself, point to a major problem here.  <\/p>  <p>  However, we know there are issues and they are dealt with whenever we have any information to track that and there is ongoing testing as well.  It is fair to say there are some employers out there who are exploiting workers, many in lower paid and sometimes precarious jobs, and no level of worker exploitation is acceptable in this country.  I could not be any clearer on that note on behalf of the Government and myself.<\/p>  <p>  That is why Ireland has robust enforcement bodies and mechanisms in place for the determination of the employment status of individuals or groups.  Where an issue arises in relation to the employment status of an individual, depending on the particular circumstances involved, cases are forwarded to the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners or the WRC.  All three have a role in any local authority contracts and any site belonging to anybody, regardless of whether it is public or private money.<\/p>  <p>  The scope and employment status investigation units of the Department of Social Protection regularly carry out investigations jointly with the labour inspectorate of the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Revenue Commissioners also have a role in identifying such cases and they carry out stand-alone investigations and those in conjunction with the Workplace Relations Commission.  They also act on evidence or information that is reported. <\/p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission completed 250 inspections in the construction sector in 2019 and 150 in 2020.  Inspections carried out by WRC inspectors operate on a compliance model.  This means that an inspector will work with an employer to ensure that the employer fulfils all their statutory obligations and that any outstanding wages or entitlements are given to workers.<\/p>  <p>  Officials within the scope section of the Department of Social Protection determine employment status and the correct class of pay-related social insurance, PRSI.  Where misclassification of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class is determined, and social insurance arrears are collected as required under the law.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, there are specific offences in relation to employment contributions. On conviction, fines or imprisonment can ultimately be imposed.  Revenue also has a strong inspection focus on the construction sector.  Importantly, the enforcement bodies work closely together carrying out on-site investigations and work to a national code agreed with the social partners.  The code of practice for determining employment and self-employment status of individuals has just been updated by  an interdepartmental working group consisting of the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and the WRC.  It is currently with the social partners for final consideration before anticipated publication in the coming weeks.  This revised code will outline the current legal tests used in the determination of employment status and, importantly, incorporates the up-to-date situation.<\/p> <p>It is important that we do that, both for the protection of employees but also to make sure that there is fair pricing when it comes to tenders so that businesses that follow all their obligations do not lose out on contracts because somebody else does not.  We are very strong on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700065#RRR00700","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623954300,"counter":430,"content":"<p>That is exactly the issue.  There are decent employers and they tell me they cannot get State contracts because they are being undercut by employers who - I am trying to think of a diplomatic word to describe them; the Minister of State probably knows the type of word I would use, but I will not use it here - are exploiting their workers via bogus self-employment and undermining the rate while they are doing work on behalf of the State.  When the Minister of State says that some employers are undermining workers' rights, they are, but the State is an actor in this.  Will he consider engaging with the local authorities to find out what practices or mechanisms, if any, are in place to ensure this is not happening?  This is not in every local authority.  My read of it is that in some cases the cheque is signed and so long as the work is done, there is very little oversight from the local authority.  Local authorities should be proactively ensuring that the rate is respected, that workers are not in a bogus self-employment situation but are in fact contractors where there is an employment relationship that is honoured.  That is not happening in every case.  I know the Minister of State is not naive enough to think that it is.  What I want to establish is whether there are practices in place and instructions coming from the Government to agencies, in this case specifically to local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I apologise that the reference to local authorities was missing from the original request for the Topical Issue debate.  Is there a specific mechanism in place in local authorities to monitor the situation?  I do not believe there is.  Does the Minister of State agree with me that there should be one?  Could he take steps to ensure that happens, so that at the very least when the State is spending money it is making sure that the money is being spent on decent work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700066#SSS00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1623954300,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I would love to engage in more detail with the Deputy specifically on local authorities, but for whatever reason the reference was left out of the text as it appeared in the list of Topical Issue matters so I cannot address it.  I will certainly gather any information she wants on that space as well.  There are agencies with responsibility for this  - principally, Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the WRC, which have specific units to deal with the issue.  They work with anybody who issues State contracts.  Most importantly, they work on information, feedback and evidence or any suggestion of improper behaviour on a site.  Any evidence or data the Deputy has, or if someone has come to her, can be fed into the system and addressed.  I am familiar with the work of the bodies, which I have seen on many occasions.  I have seen them in operation on sites.  The agencies go in together as a team to deal with concerns and they follow up on issues.  They cannot track every site or every contract, but they monitor a selection of sites.  They most certainly act on information, so I urge the Deputy to bring forward any evidence she may have, and I will have it dealt with as well.  In most cases, it is clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  The Deputy is correct: I am not naive.  We know what goes on, but to be fair, the majority of employers are sound and good employers and we must keep reaffirming that.  While there will always be some that we are not happy with, we must recognise the majority are decent employers, who stepped up during Covid as well.<\/p>  <p>  Where there is doubt regarding the employment status of an individual, the relevant Department and agencies will have regard to the code of practice for determining his or her status.  A great deal of work is under way in this area and the revised code of practice on determining employment status will reflect recent case law.  It will help us address other issues outside the construction sector, because there are other areas of concern that we want to deal with as well.<\/p>  <p>  The matter was discussed recently at a meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum subgroup on employment and enterprise, which is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, with the participation of the Department of Social Protection, Revenue and the WRC.  At that meeting, the T&aacute;naiste requested that officials continue to explore fully all issues relating to the determination of employment status to better capture the realities of new and legitimate forms of work.  As the Deputy will be aware, that is something in which he has a strong interest and he is determined to take any action that is required.  That process has commenced and is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, a second phase consultation of social partners on a possible action addressing the challenges relating to working conditions in platform work has been launched.  The Government takes all exploitation of workers very seriously.  There are robust enforcement bodies working together on the ground, with an agreed code of practice for dealing with complaints of bogus or false self-employment.  Any worker, Deputy or colleague who has information or concerns about a person's employment and PRSI status should contact the Department of Social Protection, Revenue or the WRC and the matter will be investigated.  I assure the Deputy that if she has any evidence to give me that I will make sure it is investigated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700066#SSS00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Investigations","time":1623954300,"counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700066#SSS00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1623954300,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State of taking the matter.  I know he is not the line Minister for the Department but I want to draw his attention to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, catchments report issued this week on the assessment of catchments and the reductions in nitrogen concentrations to achieve water quality objectives.  The short synopsis of the document is that we have a problem with nitrogen.  We have a problem in particular in the south and the east of the country and our indicators are moving in the wrong direction.<\/p><p>I will quote the key highlights in the report:<\/p> <blockquote> \tElevated nitrogen concentrations in waters is one of the factors that leads to poor water quality outcomes in all waters. Estuaries and coastal waters, and groundwater drinking water supplies are particularly at risk.<br \/><br \/>There are a number of key catchments of concern with elevated nitrogen concentrations along the south, southeast and east coasts including the Maigue\/Deel, Bandon, Lee, Blackwater, Suir, Nore, Barrow, Slaney, Tolka\/Liffey and the Boyne river catchments.<br \/><br \/>Nitrogen concentrations in waters have been increasing since 2013 - between 2013 and 2019, all but one of the catchments of concern showed increasing trends in the amount, or load, of nitrogen discharging to the sea via our rivers.<br \/><br \/>The nitrogen load discharging to sea needs to be reduced in the catchments of concern to support healthy aquatic ecosystems.  The scale of reduction needed ranged from zero in some years, to just over 8,000 tonnes of nitrogen in the Barrow catchment in 2018.<br \/><br \/>The data show that in the predominantly rural catchments, more than 85% of the sources of nitrogen in the catchment are from agriculture, from chemical and organic fertilisers. <\/blockquote>  <p>In the case of the Barrow, the Suir and the Nore rivers, the three sisters as they are referred to, which drain upwards of 9,000 sq. km in the south east in their combined catchment, the figure is above 90%.  In contrast, the majority of the nitrogen &quot;in [the] Liffey\/Tolka catchment, which incorporates Dublin City, is from urban waste water&quot;.<\/p><p>The problem is particularly pronounced in the south east, my area.  Taking the most up-to-date figures from the report from 2019 and combining the figures from the Nore, the Suir and the Barrow, the report estimates that just over 20,000 tonnes of nitrogen were discharged.  That are 20,000 tonnes flowing out between Hook Head and Dunmore East into what is supposedly a special area of conservation.  It is flowing past Woodstown where shellfish fisheries are reporting significant mortalities in their oyster harvest.  People living in the estuary all their lives report a steep decline in mussels and other shellfish.  However, I would caveat that by pointing out that a number of factors may be at play in this.<\/p><p>I am always conscious of the dangers of conflating causation and correlation.  The <i>Farming Independent<\/i>supplement of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>trumpeted in April 2020 that since the abolition of milk quotas in 2015, there has been a 38% increase in cow numbers and 92% of that increase accrued in Munster and Leinster.  When combined with the figures in this report, it leads to an almost inescapable conclusion that the intensification of agriculture in the past decade, in particular in the dairy sector, has placed greater pressure on rivers and watercourses.<\/p><p>I wish to stress a point to the Minister of State in the strongest terms.  I wish to dispel a lazy anti-farmer narrative often pushed about the Green Party.  I do not for one second blame the individual farmer in this.  I have family members who farm.  I am from a rural parish myself and I understand farmers have a business to run and a living to make.  I do not know any farmer who would not like to reduce his input costs and who would not like to get more bang for his buck in terms of the fertiliser he uses on his land.  Are we doing enough as a Government to support farmers in allowing them to make a living while taking pressure off river catchments, the effect of which we are seeing in this report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700066#SSS00500","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1623954300,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for providing an opportunity for the Department to give an overview of the current work being undertaken to address the quality of our water.  I apologise to him on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the senior Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who could not attend this evening, but they and their officials will engage with the Deputy again on this issue.<\/p> <p> I welcome the report from the Environmental Protection Agency which highlights one of the serious challenges facing Ireland&rsquo;s water environment.  Our water resources are facing complex pressures and increasing demands from population change and expected further growth in the economy, as well as from a changing climate. <\/p> <p> On agricultural nutrients, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on effective measures to address these issues through the river basin management plan, the nitrates action programme and the CAP strategic plan.  Our policy is to ensure we provide the right measure in the right place.  As outlined in the river basin management plan for the years 2018 to 2021, and now in the EPA&rsquo;s report, the pressures on water quality can vary across different catchments, as outlined so well by the Deputy.  As a result, it is clear that one-size-fits-all measures are not always fully effective.  For example, a free advisory service is now available to farmers in priority areas where the EPA identifies agriculture as a significant pressure on water quality.  Where urban wastewater is causing an impact, Irish Water is investing in improved services and infrastructure through its capital investment plan.  The Government has also improved targeted financial supports to help bring domestic septic tanks up to standard.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government commits Ireland to producing a new, stronger river basin management plan in 2022.  The draft plan will be based on three principles that emerged from the Department&rsquo;s review of the second cycle.  First, there is an increased level of ambition.  The third cycle plan will need a high level of ambition in response to water quality trends, something the Deputy will welcome and, indeed, he contributed to making sure it was in the programme for Government.  Second, on integrated catchment planning, local catchment management plans will be put in place for each of the 46 catchments.  This will provide opportunities for greater public participation and engagement of key stakeholders and sectors at a local and regional level.   The Deputy is right that many local stakeholders will be happy to engage in different ways and will be content to be part of the solutions.  Third, there will be multiple benefits and many of the measures needed to protect and improve water quality can also deliver benefits for biodiversity and climate change.<\/p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates action programme is another key instrument in regard to achieving good water quality.  It is designed to prevent pollution of surface waters and groundwater from agricultural sources, and to protect and improve water quality.  The current regulations run to the end of 2021 and a new nitrates action programme will be published at the beginning of 2022.  A second consultation phase on the review of the nitrates action programme will be published in the coming weeks.  This review is being led by the nitrates expert group, which includes scientific experts from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The nitrates expert group will assess the most up-to-date scientific evidence and advise the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the measures that should be included in the next action programme.  The expert group is also engaging in bilateral discussions with interested stakeholder groups as part of the review.<\/p> <p> This review of the programme also gives us an opportunity to ensure it contributes to achieving biodiversity and climate action objectives, as well as water quality objectives.  Policy coherence is a key component of protecting our environment and these areas cannot be successfully tackled in isolation.<\/p> <p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is preparing Ireland&rsquo;s CAP strategic plan, which will also make an important contribution to protecting and restoring water quality.<\/p> <p> Across all these areas - the revision of the river basin management plan, the nitrates action programme and CAP &ndash; the Department is working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure we see significant improvement in water quality in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700066#SSS00600","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623954900,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I welcome that response.  It is comprehensive and, in fact, I am going to print it out from the D&aacute;il record, keep it in my office and hold the Minister of State to account on it.<\/p>  <p>  Of the things mentioned by the Minister of State, the river basin management plan is pivotal.  He is correct that different areas are undergoing different pressures and some of the mapping that is done as part of the report is very useful on that.  The other point the Minister of State makes that is very important is the idea of the right measure in the right place.  The report points out that the soil type in a particular area very much influences run-off and how we should look at the nitrogen use that is going to be useful and effective on the land.  Farmers have to pay big money to spread nitrogen on their land but analysts say only something like 25% of that makes it into the final product and the rest either ends up in our water courses or, more worrying still when we consider climate change, through volatilisation it ends up in our atmosphere, and it is a very potent greenhouse gas, as the Minister of State knows.<\/p>  <p>  These interventions can be low-cost and high-effect, and even by changing the mix or changing the root profile of the grasses that the farmers are growing, we reduce their input costs, and just changing that root profile increases the amount of nitrogen that stays on the land.  Setback distances from rivers are also a very low-cost but effective intervention.  It even comes down to things like moving to protected urea rather than the usual nitrogen product.  There definitely are solutions.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, the key stakeholders in all of this, the farmers, are absolutely ready to work with us on this but it is pivotal that we lead on this as a Government.  We have seen declining water quality and it has an effect on our marine environments.  We need to turn that around in a way that works for the environment and also for the people who are working on our farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700067#TTT00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1623954900,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the debate.

He is right that everybody wants to play their part in this area and that they need leadership and assistance from the Government across all Departments, which is key.<\/p>  <p>  I believe we can meet the challenge of protecting and improving our water quality.  We all know that we cannot take a business-as-usual approach.  It must be a sincere collective effort to reverse recent water quality decline as the causes and answers are not within the grasp of just a few individual groups or sectors.  Everyone needs healthy and well protected water catchments and the Government is working to ensure collective collaboration to the benefit of all.<\/p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s most recent report highlights the challenges we face as a country and society, yet we also have the policy instruments to find a way forward to address these challenges.  If we have a full cross-departmental approach to this through government, we can achieve greater results on the next assessments.  I believe the programme for Government sets out a path to achieve that, as referenced earlier.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the work during the current plan, the new river basin management plan will describe the main pressures and activities affecting water status, set out the environmental objectives to be achieved over the period 2022-27 and identify the measures needed to achieve these objectives, including those highlighted by the EPA.  The nitrates action programme will also set out objectives to control nutrient loss to our rivers and lakes.  As the Deputy said, that comes at a high cost to farmers, who do not want to see this waste either.  The majority are well prepared to engage and to work their way through this.  With both the review of the nitrates action programme and a draft river basin management plan due to be published shortly for public consultation, I urge all stakeholders to engage in these process to ensure we achieve the best outcomes for our water bodies.<\/p>  <p>  I again thank the Deputy for raising the issue.

One is that we will have an extension of the services to those areas that are not currently covered, which I welcome.  We have strong local employment services in our area and we greatly value the contribution they make.  I can imagine the gap they would leave if communities did not have them, so I welcome that development.<\/p>  <p>  We will also see the roll-out of a tender scheme for the rest of the country.  While there has not been a tender scheme for the best part of 20 years, and I understand from speaking to the Minister that there is no other option but to tender for this service, I have real fears, as do the local employment service operators, that the model that is being used, and the lots that may be allocated, may mean that services are missing from our local communities.<\/p>  <p>  Let me talk the Minister of State through that concern.  The Dublin North West Area Partnership operates the local employment service in Rosehill House.  People tell me that their fear under the new contract is that it is effectively an &ldquo;in and out&rdquo; payment process and it does not take into account the strong and quality work that is done with clients, particularly clients who might be experiencing addiction and who are working into recovery, people who have been long-term unemployed for many years and people who are changing career.  A simple entry meeting, exit meeting progression tick is not the normal path for many of those clients.<\/p> <p>If we only pay the local employment services based on that model, then we will not get the service that we currently have.<\/p> <p> We have the Ballymun Job Club.  It predates the local employment service.  It was a co-operative established by the community to address some of the social needs in Ballymun many years ago.  It has worked with different local partnership companies over the years but it has appeared independently.  It is concerned about the lots that will be allocated.  I understand that there are currently 11 lots.  If there is a reduction in the number of those lots, it will effectively force different local employment services to compete against each other for existing territory.  That is not what any of us want to see.  We know these organisations are doing a good job and there are mechanisms to make sure that they are and that where organisations are falling down, that can be addressed.  We are concerned about the model, the technical guidelines of how they will be paid and the number of lots.  The fear is based on what happened with the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  Everybody in this House knows that genuine mistakes were made with SICAP.  Whether one believes that it was an attempt to privatise the service which failed because private operators could not deliver the same service that community operators could or whether one believes that the tender was allocated poorly, we have to learn from the mistake.  We have to make sure that the local employment service contracts that are rolled out do not decrease the lots, and capture the quality of work needed from many of these agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700067#TTT00400","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623955500,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McAuliffe for raising this issue and having this debate.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, sends her apologies.  She would like to have engaged with the Deputy directly but could not.  She engaged with the committee on the subject yesterday.  If Deputy McAuliffe has not received the message yet, the Minister has agreed to meet with him and a delegation to tease through the concerns about this issue and hopefully allay the Deputy's fears.  I think she will be able to do that because some of the fears expressed by Deputy McAuliffe and others here are well allayed in my view from my time working in the Department of Social Protection.  I am mainly in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but I also have a leg in the Department of Social Protection and work with it on many issues related to labour activation, with people who are looking for jobs, and directly with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I am quite confident, from engaging with it, that it has the needs of individuals in mind here.  I will return to the formal statement shortly.  This model is mainly based on progression, personal development and engagement.  I assure that Deputy that it is not just about going in and out.  I urge anybody concerned to get involved in the tendering process when it comes their way and to go to the workshops.  They will then realise that it is about progression and engagement, which is what the main part of this will be about.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss matters surrounding the provision of employment services in the State.  The Department of Social Protection published a request for tender on 26 May for the procurement of regional employment services in parts of the State where there is currently no employment service.  This is a welcome expansion of employment services, announced last year in the July stimulus package.  This expansion of services involves tendering for four lots across seven counties in the north west and midlands.  Those lots are Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, Longford and Westmeath, and Laois and Offaly.<\/p>  <p>  The existing contracts of the Department of Social Protection's main contracted employment services providers, including local employment services, job clubs, and JobPath, all expire at the end of this year.  Not replacing these contracts would entail a significant reduction in public employment service capacity.  Instead, the Department is now increasing its capacity, through the expansion of a new regional employment service model throughout the State.  Parties interested in the current tendering process now have until 7 July to prepare tenders.  While the procurement is competitive, in line with legal requirements, there are numerous local and community bodies in those counties already supplying similar services on behalf of their communities.  They will be well positioned to tender for these new lots and have been fully engaged at various meetings and workshops with the Department over the last couple of years as we prepared for these changes.<\/p>  <p>  The key requirement in the request for tenders is quality of service.  That is key, so we can ensure, and will be happy to ensure, that those who are long-term unemployed will receive a high quality employment service.  This procurement will ensure the State extends the range of employment services it provides to seven counties, which is a welcome and timely development because those counties did not have the service.  I know there is some concern among current service providers as the State moves to an open competitive procurement process and moves on from the \"cost met\" funding approach of current local employment services and job clubs.<\/p>  <p>  The current contracts operate on an annual basis, provide only partial State coverage and have largely gone unchanged in two decades or longer in some cases.  In some cases, they are cumbersome and administratively burdensome for the service providers and the Department and are not procured in a way that is in accordance with national and EU procurement rules.  The new funding approach, with payments tied to the actual number of clients supported and weighted towards the client&rsquo;s engagement and progression with the service, which is key, will be multi-annual, enabling providers to plan how best to meet the needs of their clients across different calendar years.<\/p>  <p>  Phase 2 of the procurement process, which will occur later this year, will see the Department of Social Protection issue requests for tenders to provide employment services nationally.  A series of separate requests for tenders will issue to complete the roll-out of the new regional employment service State-wide.  It is expected that existing local community providers will be well placed to submit quality tenders for these new regional employment services.  The Department recognises that quality that can be found locally.  The Department of Social Protection will consider any lessons from the phase 1 procurement process and apply them in the design of the multiple requests for tenders that will be published later this year under phase 2.  They review their ongoing work over the last seven or eight years too, with all the changes through the Intreo offices and the expansion of services here.  All of that feeds into the changes that are coming through the system this year and next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700068#UUU00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1623955500,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I have heard the Minister of State's contribution here and heard the Minister's yesterday.  I welcome that she will meet with a number of Fianna F&aacute;il backbench Deputies about this because we are greatly concerned about it.  My local employment service, as with many across the country, issued a press release last week stating that the Government was implementing a for-profit model that would reduce community services.  I hear the Minister of State and he is saying that that is not true and that, when the tender comes out, that will not be the case.  If the Minister of State knows many of these local employment services, they do not normally engage in that type of vocal political criticism of a Government.  If they are doing so, it is because they are concerned.  I ask the Minister of State to make sure that local focus happens.  He referred to engagement and progression being important.  Engagement is the more important of the two.  We need to ensure that those local services remain.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the use of the term \"regional employment services\" as opposed to \"local employment services\".  That comes back to the lot numbers.  How many lots will there be in Dublin?  With the previous SICAP model, Ballymun lost its local partnership.  It did not lose the service.  A neighbouring partnership took over that contract and delivered the service but we lost the local focus.  We want to make sure that does not happen and that something that is not intended, which the Government does not want, which is the progression of a for-profit model, does not happen by accident because we issued the wrong number of lots and end up with different local organisations competing with each other.

Being based in the Department of Social Protection, I am familiar with the two local services that the Deputy mentioned and I have engaged with them over the years.  I am confident that the Department and Minister understand the importance of engagement and progression.  If we are to provide a successful employment service to anybody, whether recently unemployed or long-term unemployed, there has to be engagement which is about a person's personal progression and a specific plan to bring them on that journey.

The tender will allow the Department to contract out employment services on a legally sound basis and in line with national and EU procurement rules.  It will also increase our capacity to provide a top-class service as soon as people need it because we recognise the pressure that might come on the system in the time ahead.<\/p> <p> No existing local employment services will be impacted by this current tender phase, as I am sure the Deputy is aware.

There are two full-time therapists, two part-time therapists, a number of volunteers, an administrator and clinical director.  Hesed House provided a brilliant service, but it is now in liquidation.  I am not here to ask the Minister of State to go into the details of what caused that liquidation.  Clearly the HSE or the charity regulator has responsibilities in respect of due diligence if there were questions relating to governance, public funding, oversight or corporate failings.  I am raising the issue because there is now no service in place.  Anybody who has worked with people who have been in counselling will recognise that continuity of counselling is vital, particularly given the year we have been through.  <\/p>  <p>  Can the Minister of State guarantee that the funding the HSE provided to this service in the past will remain for counselling in the area?  Can we get some stopgap measure in the first instance to ensure that counselling continues for those who require it?  We also need to build up a new counselling service on the same type of model, a free counselling service as needed by many of the families in the area.<\/p>  <p>  The drugs task force in the area has assured me that its portion of the funding from the HSE will remain in the area.  I am not sure about the Tusla money.  Those were the three streams of funding as well as a small amount of funding the volunteers and therapists managed to raise.<\/p>  <p>  There is a clear demand and the support for such a service in the area from the partnership.  I am on the drugs task force.  Local schools have been crying out for expansion of the services that were there.  The Core Youth Service, Common Ground, St. Michael's family resource centre and many more have stated they were appalled that it was closing.  We need to bear in mind that people are losing jobs, some of them after ten or 15 years in employment.  <\/p>  <p>  The facility closed on 4 June.  Hopefully we will be able to help people to get services in other areas, but I ask for the HSE to step in.  This is not additional money.  This is the money that is already allocated but it now needs to be diverted to provide a counselling service that up to now was provided by a different company in Hesed House.<\/p>  <p>  It is an area that like many other areas of Dublin has felt the effects of poverty, crime and many other ailments that affect our society.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to give me good news today.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700069#VVV00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1623956100,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for raising the issue.

I am very aware of the important role that organisations such as Hesed House played under the drugs strategy in assisting families to cope with addiction issues through family therapy and counselling services.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Hesed House received &euro;287,000 in public funding in 2020, with &euro;108,000 from HSE addiction services, &euro;132,000 from Canal Communities Drug and Alcohol Local Task Force, and &euro;47,000 from Tusla.  As the Deputy said, organisations entrusted and funded by the State to provide services on its behalf are accountable for that funding.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE notified Hesed House on 1 December 2020 that it would cease funding the organisation at the end of June 2021 due to ongoing concerns over its governance and operation.  Unfortunately, attempts by the HSE and the local drug and alcohol task force to contact and engage with the service to explore alternative arrangements for funding were unsuccessful.<\/p>  <p>  All section 39 agencies part-funded by the Government are accountable to the State.  Therefore, standards of governance, accountability, compliance and regulatory structures must be adhered to.  The section 39 sector provides vital services for thousands of people throughout Ireland.  I am very grateful for the work that is carried out by these providers on behalf of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, the board of management of the service made a decision in May 2021 to close the service on 4 June 2021.  I understand that the HSE became aware of this through Hesed House staff on 3 June.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the service in 2018 highlighted the very small proportion of individuals attending Hesed House who were receiving care for addiction-related issues.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I intend to do all that I can to ensure that the closure of Hesed House does not have a significant impact on people in Dublin 8, 10 and 12 accessing appropriate care, as the Deputy articulated very well.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the assurance by the HSE that a number of projects within the Dublin 8, 10 and 12 areas provide counselling and that any gaps in service provision will be addressed through these services.  I have asked the drug's policy unit in my Department to liaise with the HSE with the aim of ensuring all service users of Hesed House gain access to alternative appropriate care in their area.<\/p>  <p>  If any issues are outstanding, I ask the Deputy to email them to me and I will try to raise them within the Department.  We are concerned about care and also about staff.  If we can be of assistance on any issues at this difficult time, I would be only too happy to help.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700069#VVV00400","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1623956100,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reassurance regarding ongoing issues.

Schools in particular, which in other areas are often crying out for services, had one here.  Young people in particular could turn up at the doorstep and be looked after.  It also stood up to the mark during the pandemic.  Given where we are as a society with regard to mental health and what we have experienced over the pandemic of the last two years, never mind all of the additional pressures faced by people living in those areas, it is vital that a service which can last, rather than a stopgap measure, be put in place as soon as possible.  I am happy that the Minister of State has assured us that the drugs policy unit in his Department will liaise with the HSE to ensure that a service is put in place and, if at all possible, that all the community stakeholders will work together to ensure that this service is put in place as quickly as possible so that there will not be a break in counselling or therapy for those most in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700069#VVV00500","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623956700,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for the opportunity to update him on the closure of Hesed House in Inchicore.

I sincerely hope that the legislation will be supported by all Deputies and all parties.  Ireland's standing in the global corruption index has fallen.  We now sit well below the states against which we like to compare ourselves.  According the latest Edelman Trust barometer, fewer than half of people surveyed trust our Government leaders.  Trust in politics and in public administration is intrinsic to democracy.  It should be especially so in a republic.  For much of our short history as an independent state, the political culture and the dominance of one political party saw our politics poisoned by abuse of public office at the highest levels.  In the 1980s, when this country was on its knees, some of our elite politicians were living high on the hog, having enriched themselves through the high offices they held.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the many reasons I became a member of the Labour Party is because of our position on corruption and on the need for transparency and integrity in public life, and because we linked those very principles to the health and quality of our democracy.  From the first moves to bring in ethics legislation to the initial Freedom of Information Act in 1997 to taking money out of politics and other such important measures, real reform in the space of ethics in public office tends always to start with us.  We are proud of our record.  The latest initiative came in 2015.  The last Oireachtas was sadly largely an ethics reform-free zone.  The Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 was an important initiative by my colleague, Deputy Howlin.  This Act is six years old.  Given the passage of time and given what we and the regulator have learned about how these relatively new laws have worked in practice, it is timely that they be reviewed and tightened up.  <\/p>  <p>  I have no difficulty with lobbying.  Some people seem to, but I do not.  I believe it is important for our democracy.  One person's lobbyist is another person's advocate.  Lobbying and advocacy are part of an open and democratic society.  It is how we choose to regulate and limit such activity, and how transparent we choose to make it, that defines our decision-making processes.  While the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 has been lauded in many circles as an important public policy measure, there are few sanctions in the Act to enforce compliance with regard to certain kinds of breaches.  This is despite repeated requests by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and other experts in recent years to give our political watchdog more bite.  <\/p>  <p>  The Act was never meant to stay still.  Calls by SIPO to legislate to give it more firepower have fallen on deaf ears.  We have seen too many cases of former Ministers and others leaving office on a Friday and walking into a new gig on Monday without even bothering to send a cursory note to SIPO looking for an exemption.  This kind of behaviour, carried out with impunity, rightly drives the people we represent mad and does nothing to dislodge the narrative that politicians are all at it, are all the same and are all out for themselves.  <\/p>  <p>  The cases of top politicians with which we are familiar do not, however, highlight the full extent of this problem.  The revolving door is also alive and well among special advisors and senior civil servants, although this is less well known and receives less coverage.  Allowing those with intimate knowledge of the corridors of power to be so easily poached and employed to act on behalf of big corporations and lobby groups undermines the credibility of our system of governance.  Today we must finally make a start in closing some of these glaring loopholes, which allow former officeholders and senior officials to act without consequence.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulation of Lobbying (Post-Term Employment as Lobbyist) Bill 2020 is a short and simple Bill.  It is a first step in strengthening and further enhancing the powers of SIPO and in properly regulating the conduct of former officeholders and others post employment.  As it stands, SIPO has the power to investigate relevant contraventions of the 2015 legislation.  These include failing to register, failing to make returns to the lobbying register, providing false or misleading information and failing to co-operate with investigations.  Under section 18 of the Act, SIPO may initiate an investigation of a person who it reasonably believes has failed to comply with an investigation or is obstructing an investigation.  However, the crux of the issue is that section 22, which is supposed to prohibit former designated officials from undertaking lobbying activity for one year after departure from their posts, is not currently included in section 18 as a relevant contravention.  Put simply, SIPO does not have powers to investigate contraventions of, or to enforce, this provision of the Act in such cases.  This new Bill proposes to address this omission by adding the contravention of section 22 to the list of relevant contraventions SIPO may investigate.<\/p> <p>In so doing, section 22 of the Act as it will be amended will impose restrictions on post-term employment as a lobbyist which apply to persons who have served in certain sensitive positions.  The legislation provides for a one-year cooling-off period for Ministers and Ministers of State, special advisers and senior civil servants, as has been the case since the enactment of the 2015 Act.  This means that for one year from ceasing to hold such a position, an individual may not, except with the formal consent of SIPO, carry out lobbying activities or be employed by a person carrying out lobbying activities that involve the Department or body in which that individual served during his or her last year of office or employment.<\/p> <p> As I have noted, we know that in a recent high-profile case no such permission was sought from SIPO by a recent officeholder who moved seamlessly into a job in the industry for which, until recently, he had held ministerial responsibility.  As it stands, SIPO has no power to investigate, rebuke or impose sanctions.  This is manifestly absurd.  The case to which I refer, along with other cases, have brought into stark relief the fact that the some parts of the 2015 Act do not contain sufficient enforcement powers.  I make that point with particular reference to section 22 and the fact that contravention of that section is not an offence.  <\/p> <p> The purpose of the Bill is to regularise the situation by enabling section 22 to be properly enforced in a way the public has a right to expect.  The Bill clearly defines contraventions, the power of SIPO to authorise an investigation and that any person found to have contravened the section would be guilty of an offence.  At the lower end of the scale, the proposed amendments would use the punishments already set out in the Act and providing for a class C fine of up to &euro;2,500 on summary conviction in the District Court.  However, under this proposed legislation, if a case were to proceed to a jury trial in the Circuit Court, the punishment applicable on conviction would include a fine or imprisonment for up to two years, depending on the severity of the offence.<\/p> <p> In closing, although I welcome the fact that the Government previously committed to a review of SIPO legislation in respect of this and other matters, it is absolutely essential that it acts quickly on this particular glaring loophole.  Confidence in politics depends on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700070#WWW00400","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623957300,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann: <blockquote> \t&mdash; recognises that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s review of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 has just concluded; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; resolves that the Regulation of Lobbying (Post-Term Employment as Lobbyist) Bill 2020 be deemed to be read a second time this day six months, to allow for a proposal for draft legislation to take account of the recommendations arising from that review to be brought forward.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank Deputy Nash for bringing forward the Bill and for the opportunity to discuss this important matter.  When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I contributed to the discussion on the regulation of lobbying on Second Stage of the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill introduced by Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Doherty on 24 November 2020, we committed to working with Deputies to address the issues raised.  If I recall correctly, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell pointed out at the time that there was cross-party consensus on the need for change.  All present are in agreement on the importance of transparency and accountability to protect the public interest and to underpin public confidence in politics and in our democratic institutions.<\/p><p>I propose to outline to the House some background detail relating to the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  This is important in providing an overall context to the Bill being discussed this evening.  I will set out information on the current operation of section 22 of the Act and provide an update on the review of the Regulation of Lobbying Act which has recently concluded. <\/p><p>Communication, dialogue and engagement are central to a well-functioning democracy.  Interest groups, representative bodies, industry and civil society organisations, NGOs and third-party professional lobbyists all provide crucial input and feedback to the political and public administration systems.  It is important that this activity is transparent and open to public scrutiny as part of the proper checks and balances that mitigate any attempt to seek to exert undue or improper influence on the conduct of policy formulation, development and decision-making.<\/p><p>The Regulation of Lobbying Act has been in operation since 1 September 2015.  Its purpose is to bring that transparency.  Since that date, there has been a requirement for those who lobby designated public officials, DPOs, as they are termed in the Act, to register and report on their lobbying activities every four months on the register of lobbying.  Designated public officials include Ministers, Ministers of State, Members of the Oireachtas, MEPs, local authority members, special advisers and senior Civil Service and local authority officials.  The register, which is a web-based system, can be viewed at<i>www.lobbying.ie<\/i>and is overseen by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Currently, almost 2,200 organisations or individuals have registered their lobbying activity on the register and almost 56,000 returns are available to view.  The <i>lobbying.ie<\/i>website includes a suite of information tools designed by SIPO to help lobbyists, DPOs and the public to fully understand the Act and its obligations.<\/p><p>As Deputies are aware, the Regulation of Lobbying Act contains a statutory review provision requiring that the operation of the Act be reviewed every three years.  To date, two statutory reviews have been carried out.  Public consultations were conducted on both occasions and the final reports were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The second statutory review found that there is widespread acceptance and support for the legislation, with the Act and the register viewed in a positive and constructive light.  It is clear from the submissions to both statutory reviews that the Act and the lobbying regulations it introduced have been well received and are now accepted as the norm.  The Act is generally perceived to have met the intended objective of increasing transparency and accountability around the lobbying of DPOs, underpinned by a register that is easily accessible and navigable.  In this regard, I compliment the work of the Standards in Public Office Commission, particularly with regard to the significant amount of guidance notes, website content on <i>www.lobbying.ie<\/i>, information notices and the tailored outreach that it conducts.<\/p><p>Turning to the specific context of section 22 of the Act, the section deals with restrictions on post-term employment as a lobbyist.  It provides that certain designated public officials, such as Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and prescribed public servants, are restricted from engaging in lobbying in certain circumstances for a year after they leave their employment or office unless they obtain permission from SIPO.  These circumstances are where the lobbying activity involves a public service body with which the relevant DPO was employed or held office in the year prior to his or her leaving or is to a person who was a DPO connected with that body in the year prior to the individual leaving.  It is the responsibility of the relevant DPO to seek consent from the Standards in Public Office Commission to waive or reduce his or her cooling-off period prior to taking up the offer of employment.  A relevant DPO who is unhappy with the decision of SIPO can make an appeal.  Since the Act commenced in 2015, SIPO has received 20 such applications. <\/p><p>The purpose of section 22 is generally to manage the potential for conflicts of interest between the public and private sectors and to place restrictions on what has been perceived as a revolving door between the public and private sectors.  There are no enforcement provisions associated with breaches of section 22 of the Act.  The current approach was informed by the need to balance the right of a person to work and the proportionality of any limitations and any sanctions that may be imposed.  It also did not want to have the unintended impact of deterring participation in politics or in public service roles, particularly those in positions of short to medium term duration.<\/p><p>The former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, addressed section 22 on Committee Stage of the Regulation of Lobbying Bill in the Seanad in February 2015.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe imposition of restriction on post-term employment as a lobbyist on relevant designated public officials must be proportionate and practical because people have constitutional rights.  One of the most difficult things is to narrow or circumscribe people's right to work, which is what this provision does. <\/blockquote>  <p>The Bill before the House seeks to amend section 18 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 by including a contravention of section 22 within the definition of relevant contravention.  It proposes that the proposed amendment would have retrospective effect.<\/p><p>As Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach indicated in the House in late September last year that a review of section 22 of the Act was to be undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In response to the request of An Taoiseach and in the context of the two statutory reviews of the legislation conducted in 2017 and 2019, the Bill before the House and that initiated by Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Doherty, a thorough review of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 has been conducted and recently concluded.  That is the commitment that the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I made to the House last November.  It must be remembered that this is a complex policy area and a detailed review was necessary to properly assess the policy, legal and practical implications of the issues raised.  I assure Deputies that the review was informed by the concerns raised and points made in the House last November.  It is the intention of the Minister, Deputy McGrath, to bring a memorandum to the Government before the summer break, outlining the findings of the review and setting out associated recommendations.<\/p> <p>Given the substantial overlap between the Bill before us and the wider review of the Act that has been completed, the proposed time-limited amendment of six months to the motion that the Bill be read a Second Time would allow a sufficient period to bring forward a proposal for draft legislation to take account of the recommendations arising from the wider review, subject to Government approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700071#XXX00200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623957900,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis an Teachta Nash as an mBille seo a chur os comhair na D&aacute;la.  I commend him on bringing forward this Bill.  I welcome any legislation that seeks to shut the revolving door between Government and vested interests.  We need to keep in mind the scandals of the past year that brought this issue to the fore, including the appointment of a former Minister of State at the Department of Finance to a position with an investment fund lobbying group.  This showed very clearly the need for increased regulation of lobbying.  That particular appointment breached the cooling-off period set down for such appointments, which sent shock waves through the general public.  People were really baffled by how easily it could be done.  What is even more shocking, as already mentioned, is that there are no enforcement powers relating to the designated cooling-off period.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Nash proposes to empower the Standards in Public Office Commission to investigate suspected contraventions of section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  That section prohibits former designated public officials from engaging in lobbying activity for one year after leaving their post.  This is what is referred to as a post-employment cooling-off period.  SIPO's power to investigate would apply to contraventions of section 22 that occur after the Bill is enacted, even if the former public official left office before that date.  This would undoubtedly be an improvement on what is currently in place.<\/p>  <p>  There is scope to go further still, however.  For example, it would be best practice to extend the cooling-off period from one to two years.  The first Bill I co-sponsored in the D&aacute;il, together with Deputy Doherty, sought to implement 13 of the 22 recommendations that were submitted by SIPO to the Government in May 2019 to extend its investigative and sanctioning powers.  I will not go through all of them but will highlight a few.  The recommendations included providing the commission with further powers to investigate and report on breaches of the code of conduct.  Greater oversight of lobbying would be provided by extending the scope of section 22 of the 2015 Act to make a failure to comply with that section an offence.  This would place SIPO on a surer footing when investigating complaints.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a review of these issues but what we really need now is action.  This Bill, if not the Bill I brought forward, should be enacted as soon as possible.  We need to deal with the issues head on and without delay to restore public confidence.  In the interest of accountability and transparency, we need legislation urgently.  A revolving door between politics and the lobbying industry is corrosive to democracy and undermines public confidence that our political system is responsive to the needs of the people of this country rather than those of unelected vested interest groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700072#YYY00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1623957900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Nash on bringing forward this legislation and affording us another opportunity to deal with the issue of lobbying.  In fairness to the Minister of State, he acknowledged the lack of enforcement in regard to this matter and the need for such enforcement.  This is not the first time I have spoken on this issue.  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, referred to the legislation she and Deputy Doherty brought forward.  We welcome some aspects of Deputy Nash's Bill, particularly the proposal regarding the cooling-off period.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell put it really well when she said that we need to shut the revolving door between politics and big business and lobbyists.  There is a general perception that such a revolving door is in action, which is possibly sometimes unfair.  We leave ourselves open to that perception when we do not close off these particular loopholes and problems.  As Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell said, our party is in favour of a cooling-off period of two years rather than one.<\/p>  <p>  I am very interested in the Minister of State's comment to the effect that a review of this issue has been carried out and his reference to a memorandum that will be brought to Cabinet before the summer recess.  We need action as soon as possible.  Whether that is by way of this legislation, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's Bill or a third legislative proposal does not really matter, so long as it reflects the significant information we already have.  We know the recommendations SIPO has made on this matter.  They just need to be implemented.  As I said, the public's perception of the connection between politics and lobbying is not good.  That has arisen because of things that happened in this State in the past that show a crossover between big business, the insurance lobby, the banking sector and politics.  It is entirely necessary to separate politics from those interests.<\/p>  <p>  When speaking on this issue previously, I made the point that accountability needs to happen at governmental level and more broadly at political level.  People expect that to be done.  I also made the point that I do not always get caught up in the idea of absolute accountability and transparency.  I accept that we live in a world of grey and, from time to time, there is a necessity to get issues dealt with from the point of view of benefiting the public.  What we have, however, and what is seen to be happening, is a connectivity between politics and a power base involving big business and elites.  We need to ensure that we sever this connection in reality, as well as the perception of it.  I also said in previous discussions that there is an element of people possibly not being overly concerned about this issue if we were delivering for them on the issues that matter.  We all know what those issues are.  We are at the tail end of the pandemic and we need to restore as many businesses as possible and continue whatever supports have been given to date to ensure business owners, families and the rest of society are supported.  We know the difficulties there are for people in the taxi industry, aviation, hospitality, entertainment and many other sectors.  The list goes on.  We need to ensure we deliver for those people and we also must deliver on housing and healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  What Deputy Nash is proposing in this Bill, and what was proposed previously by Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Doherty, is very simple.  It is about ensuring that we clearly separate politics from big business lobbyists.  We can do that very easily and it is worthwhile and absolutely necessary to do so.  I put it to the Minister of State and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, that it is just a matter of getting it done as quickly as possible.  It is a very simple request and we must deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700072#YYY00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1623957900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>As there are no more Deputies offering, I ask the Minister of State to respond to the contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700072#YYY00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1623957900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Maire&aacute;d Farrell and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for their contributions.  I reiterate my thanks to Deputy Nash for bringing the Bill forward.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to amend section 18 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 by including a contravention of section 22 within the definition of \"relevant contraventions\".  It is also proposed that this amendment would have retrospective effect.  If a contravention of section 22 was deemed to be a relevant contravention under the Act, as proposed, then SIPO would be empowered to authorise an investigation to be carried out.  Furthermore, a person who commits a relevant contravention of section 22 would be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class C fine and, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, under section 22 of the 2015 Act, specific categories of relevant designated public officials are subject to a one-year cooling-off period during which they cannot engage in lobbying activities in specific circumstances or be employed by, or provide services to, a person carrying on lobbying activities in specific circumstances.  The cooling-off period applies for a full one-year term unless the relevant designated public official applies to SIPO for consent to waive or reduce that term.<\/p> <p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">This approach was considered to represent a proportionate response to the matter <\/font>on a case-by-case basis,<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"><\/font>rather than placing a mandatory blanket prohibition on relevant DPOs taking up particular roles which could be open to legal challenge by a person, for example, when moving from a relevant DPO post in the public sector to a specific post in the private sector.  It is the responsibility of the relevant DPO to seek consent from SIPO to waive or reduce their cooling-off period prior to taking up an offer of employment or to provide relevant services in circumstances where such employment or services may be, or be perceived to be, encompassed by section 22.  SIPO may decide to give consent unconditionally or give consent with conditions attached.  It may also refuse to give consent for all or part of the cooling-off period.  A relevant DPO who is unhappy with the decision of SIPO may appeal.<br\/><br\/>Since the Act commenced on 1 September 2015, SIPO has received 20 such applications.  The apparent low level of applications received by SIPO has given rise to a concern on its part that there should be more applications for consent under section 22 than have been received to date.  However, work undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2020 appears to indicate that this may not be the case.  The Department sought to analyse the numbers of relevant DPOs who moved to lobbying positions or apparent lobbying positions between 2015 and 2020.  Although this analysis has limitations because it relies on data that are publicly available, almost 250 individuals were identified as having left relevant DPO positions since the introduction of the Act to the present, with less than 20 individuals being subsequently identified as having a connection with specific lobbying posts.  The analysis produced by the Department matches broadly with the level of section 22 applications that have been received by SIPO over the same period, although as SIPO's data in relation to section 22 applications are anonymous, as provided for in section 25 of the 2015 Act, the overlap between such applications and the Department's analysis cannot be definitively determined.<br\/><br\/>As I set out earlier this evening, the Act is generally perceived to have met the intended objective of increasing transparency and accountability around the lobbying of DPOs, which is underpinned by a register that is easily accessible and navigable.  The submissions received during the public consultation that was held as part of the second statutory review highlighted some of the aspects of the Act which stakeholders perceived as important, including the additional transparency the Act has brought to the lobbying space.  The legislation is seen as comprehensive in its regulation of a wide range of lobbying activities.  The increased transparency provided by the Act in relation to lobbying activities was viewed as facilitating greater accountability.  The register was considered to be easily accessible, free and updated regularly.  The website was described as user-friendly and open to public scrutiny.  The work of SIPO was praised and positive reference was made to the support and guidance given by SIPO via its regular communications and the availability of staff to provide advice to organisations on the register.  The part the register plays in promoting the role of organisations in shaping public policy was also mentioned.  The importance of the Act in recognising lobbying as a legitimate activity which promotes the development of appropriate and effective policy and legislation was highlighted.  It was acknowledged that the Act has not led to a chilling effect on lobbying activities.<br\/><br\/>It is important to recognise that there is a solid foundation in place, but like all foundations, it needs maintenance, renewal and enhancement as required.  The recently concluded review process allowed for a detailed assessment of a range of issues raised by SIPO and which we have discussed in the House.  In addition to consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, the review included assessment of the current operation of key provisions of the Act; consultation with and consideration of the views of SIPO; and consideration of options to address concerns raised and the policy, legal and practical implications of different responses.  The core consideration was to look at how the existing solid foundation could be enhanced most effectively and efficiently, strengthening any weakness which had been identified.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I am proposing an amendment which &quot;recognises that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s review of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 has just concluded&quot; and &quot;resolves that the Regulation of Lobbying (Post-Term Employment as Lobbyist) Bill 2020 be deemed to be read a second time this day six months, to allow for a proposal for draft legislation to take account of the recommendations arising from that review to be brought forward&quot;.  I will oppose the completion of Second Stage should my amendment not be agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700072#YYY00500","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623958500,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I will not detain the Minister of State or the House for too long.  I appreciate that it is late on a Thursday evening.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for his remarks.  Dare I say it, but I think he understands, appreciates and supports the overarching principles that have informed the development of the Bill.  I wish to thank Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who spoke broadly in favour of the approach that the Bill seeks to take.  I recognise the work that Deputy Farrell has done in the context of her own Bill, which was brought to Second Stage last November.<\/p>  <p>  There is a general consensus around what needs to be done; the question is when it ought to be done.  In my view, it ought to be done now.  We do not know the minute or the hour when we might experience another case whereby, as I described in my earlier remarks, a Minister or a senior public official leaves office on a Friday and takes up another gig the following Monday that is directly related to the previous role that he or she enjoyed.  I am not, for one minute, claiming that any individual who may take up such an opportunity does so for any other reasons than having an interest in the new role that he or she has been offered and to make a reasonable living for himself or herself.  That is absolutely fair enough.<\/p>  <p>  However, the perception is everything.  The intersection between business, politics and public life more generally in this country has to be better managed.  Lobbying has to occur through a pane of glass.  The lobbying register itself has been an enormously important innovation in Irish public life.  The Minister of State is right to assert that it is working very well.  It attracts broad support.  The website is navigable, clear, transparent and easy to use.  Indeed, occasionally I look up the register to see who is lobbying who and for what purpose.  That is most important.  It is precisely what my party and Deputy Howlin, in his former role, sought to achieve back in the early 2010s when we developed the legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referenced the fact that very few applications were made to SIPO for consent or an exemption under the terms of the Act.  There are a number of different ways to interpret the information that the Minister of State has provided to the House.  My view is that given that very few section 22 applications were made by those who were leaving particular roles and moving into new ones, that makes the case for this legislation.  It will not always be the case that SIPO will decide to reach back to investigate an issue that may make it uneasy or may have caused some disquiet.  SIPO can look at it on the merits of the case itself.  As legislators, we need to provide SIPO with the opportunity to do that.  It is an opportunity that it does not have currently and one which needs to be presented to it, because we all know that transparency in public life is key to public trust in democracy.  We know that if there is not public trust in democracy, it affects social cohesion, trust in our institutions and our polity more broadly, and can lead to the rise of extreme politics and the collapse of society as we know it.  That is no exaggeration.  We know the impact that mistrust of democracy can have.  In many ways, perception is everything.  <\/p> <p>The idea that one can leave a job on Friday and move into another one on Monday with absolute impunity, when those two particular roles might have been connected, does not sit well with the public or anybody who values democracy or this institution.<\/p> <p> We need to be careful in how we proceed and proportionate in how we respond.  I absolutely understand why Deputy Howlin, when he was framing the initial legislation, did not provide for a mechanism like this at that point in time.  This was a radical departure in Irish politics and law.  It was important that we had an opportunity to assess how the legislation actually operated in practice.  Now after six years in operation, we can look at it in the round and identify how it ought to be improved.<\/p> <p> This is not direct attack on or criticism of colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in.  The one-year cooling off period gets it about right.  I know because I was involved tangentially in discussions about what this legislation might look like.  I know that the Attorney General's office would have had serious concerns about introducing anything longer than a one-year cooling off period because the right of somebody to work and to provide for themselves is important.<\/p> <p> When the recommendations are made, when the Cabinet discusses them and the memo is brought by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is it the Government's intention, given that there have been several initiatives across the House in this area, to share those recommendations with those interested in this space?  That would be an important step forward.<\/p> <p> I would like to see this legislation enacted sooner rather than later because we do not know the minute or the hour when the kind of case which arose last September will arise again.  Our focus needs to be on instilling, ensuring and guaranteeing trust in our democracy at all times.  That is why the legislation needs to be enacted as soon as possible.  That is why I, unfortunately, oppose the idea that we need to wait for another few months to allow the Government to develop its own legislation.  That said, I hope the draft legislation brought to this House by the Minister of State will include many of the propositions contained in my Bill, as well as those in the Bill from Deputies Farrell and Doherty.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for his interest in this area.  I look forward to working with him over the next few months in an effort to get this right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700073#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1623959100,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1623959100,"counter":464,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061700074#AAAA00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1623959100,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.33 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 June 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
