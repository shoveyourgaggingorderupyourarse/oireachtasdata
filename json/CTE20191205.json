Are they agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is a matter arising out of the minutes.  As a result of the correspondence received from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which we discussed at the previous meeting, the committee agreed to forward a transcript of the meeting the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Houses of the Oireachtas for a response on matters discussed.  At that meeting, we asked for a response by Tuesday, 10 December in order that we could consider it at our meeting on Thursday, 12 December, which we will be our final meeting before the Christmas recess.  I propose we ask Mr. Finnegan and a senior representative of the OPW to be on standby in case we decide next Thursday morning that we would like to meet them on Thursday afternoon.  We may or may not wish to do so but it will be too late on Thursday morning to ask them.  We ask the secretariat, therefore, to put arrangements in place to have them on standby and we will decide on Thursday morning, having received the response, whether we want to call them to appear before us.  In case we decide to do so, they will be on standby.

There are quite a number of them because there will be several witnesses today.

The item has been overtaken by the letter we received from the City of Dublin Education and Training Board last week, which operates the SUSI scheme on behalf of the Department.  We will simply note the letter, given that it contains nothing we did not discuss at the previous meeting, and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2576 is from Dr. Alan Wall, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, dated 22 November, providing information requested by the committee in respect of the use of occasional hourly payments for staff at third level institutions and the use of such payments in place of employment contracts.  The HEA states it will liaise with the higher education institutions to collate the information and will provide a report to the committee.  We welcome that step and will wait to see the report when it arrives.  We have put the issue on the authority's agenda and it will deal with it.<\/p> <p>  No. 2577 is from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 25 November, providing information requested by the committee in respect of a perceived discrepancy between oral information provided at our meeting on 7 November and a parliamentary question answered on 12 November.

Ms Licken stated that while the review has been completed and published only within the past two months, she can assure the committee the Department is working to progress all the recommendations.  There was a reference to buildings nearby in the report and she confirmed they are owned by Galway City Council, which Deputy Connolly had made clear to the committee.

Nevertheless, there is confirmation they are being implemented, which I welcome.  I also welcome the setting up of the special unit for 2040.  It seems there is ongoing learning in respect of matters but regarding the four properties, the clarification that has been received is unnecessary, given that, as the Chairman noted, the city council owns the properties.  My point was that in the post-project review, the council used the four properties to justify a F&aacute;ilte Ireland promotion of the area.  While I am delighted with that because I am from Galway and love it, the four properties have been empty since 2007.  A post-project review to consider value for money for the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema includes four properties that have been empty since 2007 but it did not raise one question mark as to why they have been empty since then.<\/p><p>They were bought at an astronomical price and have remained empty in the city which comes last in reaching its targets, although that is a matter for another day.

It is not about trying to resolve the problems of an individual or group of individuals but they represent a good test of whether the system is working.  The HSE tells us \"There is no change to how staff are paid in this regard and the system is fully configured to calculate and make these payments.\"  It essentially says that there were teething problems.  Correspondence we received from people on the other end of the system tells us something very different.  It tells us that SIPTU is involved in trying to resolve a problem.  I understand that this system is being rolled out incrementally.  That is a very good way to do things because, if one is going to run into a problem, it is better to find out before a great number of people are affected.  We are told that things such as the rate of overtime can vary depending on whether the payment relates to a Saturday or a Sunday and that there are problems with that.

We want them to spell out who are the time-returning officers and the staff in the payroll and staff records department.  We want a more detailed view.  This correspondence will come back to us when we get that information.<\/p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 2591B from Mr. Terry Sheridan, principal in planning policy and legislation in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing information relating to gender equality and the appointment of board members to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It gives detail of how many people were nominated, with 37 male nominees and 23 female nominees.  Four men and three women were appointed to the board.  The board now comprises seven men and three women in comparison with the position before 2017, when there were nine men and one woman on the board.  We will keep after this but that provides some clarification.<\/p> <p>  No. 2592B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE, dated 29 November 2019, providing information requested by the committee on the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Cuisle holiday resort.  We will note and publish this but we will hold over discussion.  Deputy MacSharry raised the matter of the facility in Roscommon the last day we met and we can give him an opportunity to discuss it next time.<\/p> <p>  No. 2596B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee regarding the post-project review of the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema project.  We will note and publish this.  It is interesting as, essentially, we were critical of the post-project review and the Department's response that a particular section in a particular Department would get this report to learn from it.  We said there is no Department-wide learning process and, far more important, there is no learning across the wider public sector from such post-project reviews.  We wrote to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to determine its role with respect to learning from these post-project reviews.  We also asked Mr. Watt about the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, which was referred to in the report but which most people had not heard of before.  He gives the detail of this and we will publish that.<\/p> <p>  There was a second recommendation that spending codes should include a requirement for every post-project review to have a section outlining key learning for the public service.  It was suggested that an appropriate way of communicating such learning to all public bodies be explored.  Mr. Watt's response is that the recommendation is being addressed in the forthcoming update on the public spending code, a guide to evaluation, planning and managing public investment, which is due to be published shortly subject to Government consideration and approval.  It appears that after all these years this type of process will be included in learning through the public spending code.  Where mistakes happen or learning should occur from a particular project, there should be a system-wide learning experience.  It is similar to the HSE experience with State claims.  Everybody makes a mistake, gets something wrong or does not do something the best way but people seem to do an internal report and do not tell anybody else about it.  We would like a little more openness and the correspondence is indicating we will get there.  We will keep an eye on that new code whenever it is published.  We will note and publish the correspondence, and at least it is a positive response to a recommendation that there should be learning across the public sector from these reports.<\/p> <p>  Next is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  We can deal with these but we will not publish them because they are from private individuals.  The first is from the Irish Road Hauliers Association, IRHA, dated 5 November 2019, responding to recent correspondence from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on its functions that have an impact on the licensed road haulage sector.  The IRHA expresses doubts about the capacity, competence and the effectiveness of the RSA in enforcing regulations and controls in the haulage sector.  The president of the organisation also states that it is not inclined to participate in meetings with the RSA.  We will note that item.  The matter has been well aired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#D01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I am not sure that is relevant to this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#D01100","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Fine.

I continue to be dissatisfied that we do not have oversight of Irish Water.  There were major transfers of infrastructure involved.  Somewhere in the region of &euro;11 billion in assets - some of them were liabilities - went to Irish Water.  We need to examine Irish Water's income, which is primarily from public funds.  It has an income from commercial water services, but we do not know what the collection rate is.  There are many elements that we need to examine.  Some local authorities applied significant development contributions that were used to build up those assets.  Now, they have found themselves with sizable deficits.<\/p> <p>  This all feeds into the question of the funding of local government.  While the issue under discussion is a specific one, we have been told numerous times that a cross-departmental group was working on local authorities' baselines, that there would be winners and losers and that the distribution of, for example, local property tax to fund local authorities would be reconfigured.  We were told by the Department earlier this year that the reconfiguration was imminent.

In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges the challenges in effectively distributing aid in such circumstances.  The total amount involved was &euro;792 million in 2018.  We can very easily examine everything that happens here in the jurisdiction but it is important to occasionally examine how taxpayer's money is spent overseas.  The difficulties in Syria and Yemen account for approximately a quarter of the total aid.  In light of that, I suggest that in the new year, if we are all here, the committee should consider a visit to one of the overseas aid projects.  We did that some years ago.

In 2018, the board's expenditure amounted to &euro;127.6 million, representing an addition to the value of fixed assets recorded in the financial statements.

I am joined here today by Mr. David Gunning, chief officer, Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer, Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, and Mr. Phelim Devine, project director.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  A planning application was lodged in 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in 2016 for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, and the two paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres - one already complete and operational at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and a second under construction at Tallaght University Hospital. <\/p> <p>  Following the approval of a guaranteed maximum price in December 2018, the NPHDB provided the Committee of Public Accounts in January 2019 with a breakdown of costs approved by Government for the design, build and equipping of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The agreed investment decision is &euro;1.433 billion.  The investment decision approved at the time was exclusive of residual risks as was communicated at the time of approval.  These exceptions were also set out within the PwC report published in April.  As pointed out by PwC, some of these risks are under our control and some are not.  We are actively managing those under our control while monitoring those that are not. <\/p> <p>  The 2018 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 24 October 2019.  The expenditure as at 31 December 2018 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was &euro;127,603,801.  An analysis of expenditure to 31 December 2017 and 2018 is included in the opening statement submitted to the committee.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to give members an update on the construction progress; those of you who have had the opportunity to visit the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital &ndash; or indeed any of you that have passed by the site recently - will have seen the progress that has been achieved.  Across the 12 acre site the excavation, piling, and the structural frame to the underground basement for campus-wide facilities management, energy centre, and the 1,000 space underground carpark are nearing completion and the first window has actually been installed in the hospital.  Well over 1 million sq. ft. of slabs have been poured.  Mr. Gunning will give the committee some further detail on the construction shortly.  The outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown was handed over to our colleagues in Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for operational commissioning earlier this year, and since we last met services have commenced there.    <\/p> <p>  Since I appeared before the committee in May, there have been a number of changes in leadership, and in relation to project governance.  Following a competitive process overseen by the Public Appointments Service, Mr. David Gunning was appointed as chief officer in September and Mr. Phelim Devine was appointed project director in October.  We have additionally added to the capabilities of the project team by engaging expertise in a number of areas.  We have reorganised the board committee structure to focus our attention on what will be our critical challenges over the coming years.  As a result of the resignation of a number of board members this year, there are vacancies on the board.  These positions were advertised via the Public Appointments Service, and we understand that a shortlist of potential candidates will be submitted to the Minister in December.             <\/p> <p>  We report to the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme, CHP&amp;P, steering group on a monthly basis, providing comprehensive updates on all aspects of the project, and we also report to the CHP&amp;P board. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Barry explain who or what those groups are as the public would have no concept?

I have a number of photographs and I would just like to talk the members of the committee through the work that is going on.<\/p> <p>  For an orientation point of view, the first photograph is taken from the north end, looking south towards the Dublin mountains.  One can see in this photograph, starting on the right-hand side, this U-shaped road which comes in from South Circular Road, comes all around the perimeter of the children's hospital site and eventually appears over on the left-hand side into St. James's.  That is the new access road, into the hospital and into the St. James's campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#K03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning"},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>It is vehicular access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#K03200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575536400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I beg the Chairman's pardon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#K03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning"},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>There are no cycle tracks or anything on this for pedestrians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#K03400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575536400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>There is a pedestrian footpath.  This is access for the emergency services, in and out, and all traffic, in and out.<\/p> <p>  This is a view of the 12-acre site.  One does not get to see a lot on this and I guess the access road is the key point.<\/p> <p>  I would like to move on to the next slide.  This is taken, again, looking in that same direction, but the key point here is we are starting to see a hospital emerging from the building site.  To talk about some of the areas here, one will see the area, \"Concourse\", that is labelled there in the centre of the photograph.  That will be, if you like, the main street up through the hospital.  One may remember that from previous presentations or models.  Again, to emphasise, that street is the length of Grafton Street, as a reference point.  Off that street, there is a multi-storey on each side.  We see on the left, going from bottom to top, we have the decontamination unit, radiology above that, critical care and then the various therapy rooms along that.  On the right, these are the fingers that one will notice if one drives by the South Circular Road.  They will be the outpatient departments.  Above that, we have cardiology, a surgical ward or other therapies, and the haematology and oncology ward on the top, and others will go on top of that.  Down on the bottom left, one will see a plant room is being constructed.  That is the location of the former access road, which has now been practically fully excavated.  That is a recent milestone that we have passed.  That plant room there will provide energy and various other services to the building.  Again, to emphasise, we are starting to see a hospital emerge from the building site.<\/p> <p>  If I could have the next one, please.  It is hard to see some of this in red.  Again, to show the scale, one will see the workers in the foreground there laying out reinforcing bar, rebar, in advance of a concrete pour.  Right above them, one sees B2, which is basement 2, basement 1 above that.  There is lower-ground floor, ground floor, levels 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Just beside the \"L\" on level 4, one starts to see some columns emerging that are the start of the supports for levels 5, 6 and 7.  An enormous amount of work has been achieved.  I will say probably the progress is not as much as we would like but we are making quite considerable progress.  That gives the scale from basement 2 all the way up to what has been done.<\/p> <p>  The next slide shows the view if one drives along South Circular Road.  The old entrance is where that traffic warden is on the left-hand side at the break in the timber there.  Again, one can see these three different figures that stick out.  What one cannot see because of the scaffolding is that we now have facade going up on these particular buildings.  Mr. Barry mentioned there is one window in.  Now tens of windows have gone in, even in the past week.  There is quite a lot of progress.  The outpatients are over on this side.  Gardens will be on top of this to provide a healing environment for the children and their families.  I mentioned previously the haematology and oncology there on the left, as that will go three more storeys on top of those fingers for the wards and other locations.<\/p> <p>  The next slide gives another view.  There is a lot of scaffolding there which is paving the way for facade, insulation, etc., that get affixed to the structure along with the windows.  That is the north block, which is probably the slower part of the build but is moving along now at a fair degree of pace.<\/p> <p>  The next slide shows the view from close to the offices that we occupy in Herberton, beside Fatima Luas stop.  The Luas runs along there from left to right and the other side of the fence is our view of the building.  To the left of that will be where the helipad is located and in there we see a so-called \"linear park\", which is a development along the Luas which provides a nice environment there for the local community.<\/p> <p>  On the next slide, just going into some of the mechanical and electrical detail, a lot of work has been done in this particular area and it is not all just concrete and steel.  On the left-hand side, one can see lagged pipes up towards the top with the silver coating on them.  Those are all for steam and hot water.  On the fire protection in the centre, the red pipes are the already-installed sprinkler system for the areas that have been developed.<\/p><p>A large number of air handling units have been installed in the level two basement, which will provide ventilation and various other services related to air quality in the entire hospital.  Basement level one is a car park and is practically complete, only requiring some lining up and finishing.  The final slide shows the orientation of the hospital from a height.  As one looks through the main street of the hospital, one can see in the distance, if one's eyesight is very good, a couple on the roof of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  This will all be enclosed eventually.  These photographs are two weeks old.  We had a presentation from the design team on Tuesday that showed even more progress than we are showing here today.  I wanted to share those photographs with the committee to give an indication of the progress made to date.  <\/p><p> As I went through the slides, I spoke about insulation.  The sustainability of the hospital has been raised in the past.  I wish to emphasise that the hospital is being built to the highest standard set out by the Building Research Establishment, BRE.  It will reach the \"excellent\" rating for energy performance and sustainability or the building energy rating, BER, A-3 standard.  This means that there will be a 60% to 70% reduction in the energy costs of this hospital in comparison to the existing hospitals being operated by CHI, which is significant.  <\/p><p> Mr. Barry mentioned the outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital and construction is also ongoing at Tallaght University Hospital.  The CHI unit at Connolly is open and is delivering services.  Almost 2,000 children have attended urgent care clinics and 1,000 outpatient appointments have taken place since the opening.<\/p><p> The images do not convey the full reality of what is going on and the scale of it.  In that context, we would be delighted to host a visit from the committee as a group or as individuals.  That invitation stands and we would welcome such a visit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#K03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The first speaker to indicate was Deputy Imelda Munster, who has 20 minutes.

I think the Chairman referenced the fact that they have updated the committee on that and expect to conclude it shortly.  As an addendum to that, I also identified earlier that as soon as we have that, at the same time as the public spending code concludes, we would intend to revise our overarching governance structures to make sure we are fully in line with the public spending code.

In addition to that, we are actually client to the project.  For the last six years, we have been working with the development board inputting into the design of the hospital.  We have inputted into the business cases and the ICT that is required to deliver this hospital.  When the business case was approved by Government in 2017, we clearly indicated that we had to bring on expertise to take on the client role to support the design and development of the hospital.  What I have included in those costs are, for example, we have set up a new entity, Children's Health Ireland.  We have had to dissolve the boards of two other voluntary hospitals and dissolve those organisations.  All of the legal work and what we call the pre-commencement assessment and review process make up some of those costs.  That is expertise in mergers, for example, and legal expertise that we would not have in Children's Health Ireland.  Like the development board, these are short-term initiatives that we had to do.  Besides providing the services to children - I appreciate that the work we are doing is challenging and we badly need this hospital because of that - we have to integrate the three children's hospitals.  When we looked at major projects like this, there are not many in the world that merge three hospitals and then move them into a new hospital.  If we do not get the integration correct, there will be challenges around that.  We are working with the staff to get our clinical and corporate processes aligned and to align how we actually operate.  This investment has been around standardising our models of care and a significant amount of it has been around ICT.  That is the other remit we have.  We are implementing projects now in the children's hospitals as single instances that we move into the children's hospital.

We want moneys to be used efficiently so that so everyone can access a public health service.  That is why we are here.  The background to this is before my time but I understand the previous Committee of Public Accounts was assured that what happened before would never happen again.  Not alone has it happened again but it is just as bad as the first time.  I understand &euro;30 million or &euro;35 million was written off on the previous occasion and now we are dealing with the same issue again.  I do not need photographs of construction sites but I do need to know the cost of the overall project and when mistakes are made and that the witnesses are learning from those mistakes.  It is totally unacceptable to have that level of spending on the services of a public relations company.  It is an absolute waste of taxpayers' money.  The witnesses are here for the purposes of accountability.  Our work should be done in a polite way and none of our questions should be put in a personalised fashion.  However, the witnesses must be held to account at this committee and every committee before which they appear.  They do not need to consult a public relations company for that purpose.  There is something seriously wrong if they are resorting to that and, in this instance, they were ill advised on the question of producing photographs.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gunning has undertaken to provide the committee with a breakdown of spending under the heading of communications and community engagement.

The Minister has talked of his interest in taking an initiative, with consultants, to try to address the de Buitl&eacute;ir recommendations.  That is likely to change the mix of private practice in our public hospitals, if not entirely eliminate it.

We will give Ms Hardiman an honorary title.  Once I committed myself to studying all the information I was convinced that this was the right place to put the hospital.  I was given a document at the Oireachtas Committee on Health about four years ago.  It stated that about 75% of the patient cohort came from the greater Dublin area.  I do not care what trouble I get into.  I cannot get into any more trouble than last week.  Anyone who tries to reverse out of the hospital's current position is really doing a disservice to the children of Ireland.  Despite some media reports, I have been a user of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin for ten years.  I have been an inpatient and a day patient.  I have used the cardiac facilities in the medical tower, the accident and emergency department and everything bar the oncology unit, touch wood.  I am fully aware of the challenges children are facing.  This is about children.  I do not see this as a poisoned chalice but as a wonderful opportunity to deliver something that successive Governments, boards and groups have failed to deliver.  I recognise the huge challenges.  I have sat in so many meetings about the children's hospital.  I understand that we need to get value for taxpayers' money and we need the best possible hospital for our children, but the constant pushback against providing this only serves to damage outcomes for the children of Ireland.  While our role is to interrogate this process, when any of us criticise the progress of the hospital we have to be very conscious of how much we needed it when it was first mooted.  Perhaps Ms Hardiman could outline this.  Consider the changes that have taken place at Temple Street Children's University Hospital and Crumlin.  We still have not delivered.  I remember seeing surgical pods being installed at Crumlin ten years ago and thinking it was a waste as we were going to build a hospital.  Ten years later we do not have that hospital.  For the record, I would like to encourage the board to keep going to get this delivered.  However everyone should consider the children who have missed out due to the persistent delays that have plagued this project.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Children's Health Ireland, CHI, it is very positive that there has been a 35% reduction in general paediatric waiting lasts in the last six months.  Can we replicate that over the next six months or is that just a push to the start line?  Similarly, there has been a reduction of 65% in the 12-month waiting list.  Can we keep pushing in that direction or have we reached a saturation point?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#Z01300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575536400,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to elaborate on that.  Our board has taken this very seriously.  With due credit to the previous hospitals, we tend to stay within our limits financially.  We do our best around safety issues, which are really important.  Access is one area in which we must make improvements.  Our overall waiting list for outpatients has reduced by 8% this year.  The biggest reduction has been in the number waiting for longer than 12 months.  That has decreased by 12%.  This does not just apply to general paediatrics.<\/p> <p>  As I was saying, general paediatrics is the one specialty to be based at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown in which we have made early investment into new ways of working.  Staff there work virtually.  There are virtual triage clinics and patients are moved to the next available slot.  There is central referral so a patient is not referred to a particular doctor.  Whoever has the shortest list gets the next patient.  It is a much more efficient way of working.  Clinics have now been set up at Connolly that do not need paper.  If the patient has been in another hospital, his or her records are scanned and sent over.  We do not have vans of paper going from place to place.  This new way of working needed investment.<\/p> <p>  I can assure the committee that we have been successful in reducing our waiting lists through initiatives with the HSE.  We are definitely starting to make an impact.  The facility in Tallaght will be opening next year.  To be quite honest, our biggest issue is the constraints of the facilities.  We are trying to implement some strategic initiatives between now and 2023 so that we do not come into this hospital with long waiting lists.  We want to start successfully and be able to implement the services that the children and families of Ireland deserve, as Deputy O'Connell says.  Our staff deserve to be working in those facilities as well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#Z01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":883,"content":"<p>To summarise Ms Hardiman's answers, staff in various sites are operating according to different protocols, with different ways of getting paid, different time schedules and different levels of management.

The first aspect was that a large part of the &euro;15 million cost I talked about was for the prolongation.  We have our design team for an extra two years.

They had 200 people working on the job for an extra six months.  When we get to this stage, which is all about the construction and implementation, there are probably over 100 people working for another year or year and a half on that.  That is where most of the cost was generated.  The timeline of the project has extended out for different reasons.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect was the &euro;9.5 million cost.  As a development board, taking our experience of the GMP and what is in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, we strengthened certain aspects of the design team and the capability within that team.  We decided, after looking at other large-scale projects internationally, that we needed additional people from the design team checking quality on site, more than we had allowed for in 2014.  There was an impact there in that the building control regulations were only in their infancy in 2014 when we tendered the job.  This is a highly complex project.  There are 6,000 rooms, every one of which has medical services in it.

I ask that the accounts for 2019 be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the end of February and that the Comptroller and Auditor General give them priority.  I cannot dictate the workload of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I acknowledge that the appropriation accounts must be done but the HSE and the NTMA are given priority.  Similar priority should be given to the largest capital project in the State.  I do not know who will be here this time next year, but the Oireachtas should not have to wait until October of next year to see the financial statements for the period that will conclude in three weeks' time.  Mr. Barry gets my point.  There should be more urgency.  It is possible that the change of directors or another matter was the reason for the delay.  Many organisations appear before the committee.  I consider this to be a critical organisation in which there is a significant amount of public interest.  It is good for the reputation of the project if information is provided in a timely manner but it damages its reputation if information must be dragged out.  I am making that point in a positive way.  I ask Mr. Barry to try to get ahead of the curve on these matters.<\/p> <p>  This is the first time Ms Hardiman has appeared before the committee.

In simple numeric terms, this is just over one third of the network originally envisaged.  A target timeframe for the delivery of the centres has not been set.  If delivery continues at the current rate, it is estimated that it will take at least a further 20 years to develop the full network.<\/p> <p>  We sought information from the HSE on the size of the existing centres, the staff deployed to each, the nature of the services provided, the procurement method and the cost.  This type of information was not available centrally, so information relating to the premises and their procurement was compiled manually from multiple sources across the HSE.  We could not get a clear picture of the range of services offered.<\/p> <p>  A key finding that emerged is that there is currently no formal definition of a primary care centre in terms of the core services to be accommodated.  The HSE currently defines a PCC in very broad terms which encompass pre-existing and new buildings, stand-alone centres and centres co-located with other services such as community hospitals.  The absence of a clear definition of what constitutes a primary care centre hinders meaningful tracking and reporting of progress. <\/p> <p>  In 2011, the HSE carried out a detailed assessment, which identified 297 potential locations for delivery of PCCs, in addition to the 43 operating at the end of 2010.  The HSE ranked all 340 locations in order of priority for delivery or development, based on assessments of local service need, existing infrastructure and the level of deprivation in the catchment area.  That ranking has not been revisited by the HSE since 2012, despite significant changes in population and economic conditions.<\/p> <p>  Some 27 PCCs were brought into operation in 2011 and 2012.  Following the HSE&rsquo;s location ranking exercise, a further 57 centres were delivered between 2013 and March 2019, but the delivery of these centres has not followed the ranked order of priority.  As a result, almost half of the 50 locations ranked with highest priority in 2012 were recorded in March 2019 as being at \"early planning\" stage, or had no indication of progress in the delivery of a centre. <\/p> <p>  The HSE has used three main models for procurement of the centres delivered since 2013, namely, direct commissioning of a building by the HSE; long-term leasing from local developers and-or investors; and a public private partnership, PPP, to build and make available a bundle of 14 care centres on HSE-owned sites.  The various delivery models have very different cost structures, making any comparison of the costs and benefits of each option difficult.  Given the volume of delivery over the past five years or so, it would be opportune for the HSE to undertake a formal cost-effectiveness comparison of the different procurement methods.<\/p> <p>  The original model outlined for primary care delivery envisaged that each PCC would accommodate one or more core primary care teams, supported by a wider network of health and social care professionals, as outlined in figure 15.1 of this chapter of the report.  However, as the HSE does not currently have an integrated reporting system, specific information is not available on the number and mix of teams in each operational centre, the numbers of filled and vacant posts, or the types of services being provided by the teams.  For the purposes of this examination, the HSE reported that, as of July 2019, there were 421 primary care teams in place, of which only about 56% had direct GP involvement.  As shown in figure 15.13, most community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas do not have the planned number of primary care teams. Only Dublin north CHO has the target number of teams with GP involvement.<\/p> <p>  The report makes four recommendations in regard to the management and monitoring of the development of primary care centres.  These recommendations have been accepted by the Department of Health and the HSE, which will be able to provide members with an update on their implementation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#PP00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575536400,"counter":1219,"content":"<p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":1220,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I apologise for that.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting to discuss chapter 15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 report.  The senior management colleagues joining me today are Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Dean Sullivan, chief strategy officer; and Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer.  I am also joined by Mr. Jim Curran, our head of estates, who has stayed on from this morning's session.  We submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting and so I will confine my opening remarks to a few specific issues.<\/p> <p>  I will first give a financial overview of the situation.  A key priority for the HSE is maximising the provision of safe services to the people we serve, while operating within the funding provided to us.  This continues to be a significant challenge due to the ever-increasing level of demand on our services, which is influenced by factors such as a growing population with an ageing demographic, changes in technology and clinical practice, and ongoing societal and economic change.  We have continued our intensive focus on current year financial management and financial planning for 2020.  Senior managers across the organisation have been engaging with us regarding activity and expenditure and the related challenges of operating within available resources.<\/p> <p>  The latest financial position, as of September 2019, shows a variance from budget, including first charge, of &euro;319 million or 3%.  Of this, 37%, or &euro;119 million, relates to our operational service areas.  The comparable figure for the same period in 2018 was almost 100% higher at &euro;636 million of which 80%, or &euro;507 million, was in the operational service areas.  Pension and demand-led areas account for &euro;200 million of the variance as of September 2019.  The greatest cost pressures within our operational services relate to the provision of residential placements to people with an intellectual disability and the provision of specialised emergency care within acute hospital settings, particularly in the context of an ageing population with increasingly complex needs.  The costs within our pensions and demand-led areas are mostly driven by policy, legislation, demographics and the macroeconomic environment and are not generally amenable to normal in-year financial management.  State Claims Agency reimbursements also fall within this area and there is a significant and ongoing focus on mitigating, insofar as is practical, the underlying risks which give rise to claims.<\/p> <p>  My monthly financial management meetings with community healthcare organisation, CHO, chief officers and hospital group CEOs will continue to year end.  All areas are clear about their allocated financial limits and performance expectations up to year end to mitigate, insofar as is practical, any deviations from those limits, thereby reducing the extent of any challenge to be dealt with in 2020.<\/p><p>The discipline of these monthly financial meetings will continue throughout 2020.<br\/><br\/>A key focus for ongoing financial management efforts have been on improving compliance with our pay and staffing controls, including whole-time equivalents, agency and overtime.  Although staffing levels will increase again in 2019, any increases must be managed in a way that is both planned and affordable. This necessary adjustment to the controls on pay and staffing is proving difficult but it must become part of our normal way of working.  I acknowledge that this is a challenging process but the board of the HSE and I are committed to ensuring that there is an improved culture of delivery within the funding provided by the State.  I fully believe that doing this will put us in a stronger position to secure investment for the future, which will ultimately be in the best interest of our service users and their families.<br\/><br\/>The HSE national service plan for 2020 was adopted by the board on 4 November and submitted to the Minister for consideration.  The approval process is well advanced with correspondence having been received from him and replied to within the past week.  I expect the plan will be published within the next week or so.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The HSE welcomes the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on primary care centres.  I note that the four recommendations in the report have been accepted and will be implemented in consultation with the Department of Health and in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  The development of PCCs to accommodate the HSE primary care teams and GPs in the one location is a key enabler for the delivery of primary care services.  A number of years ago the primary care division of the HSE, in conjunction with HSE estates, identified 341 locations for primary care centres.  In 2012, these locations were prioritised on the basis of service need, existing facilities and level of deprivation.  The most suitable delivery model of the primary care centre was also identified.<br\/><br\/>The three models used for the development of PCCs are as follows: Exchequer-funded development, capital plan; PPP, the Government stimulus programme; and the operational lease.  Of the 341 locations identified during the 2012 prioritisation process, 127 locations are now operational.  A further 77 primary care centres are in the process of being developed.  Taken together, this represents 204 or 60% of the original 340 locations identified.  The HSE, in 2020, will complete an overarching review of PCCs that will include an update of the rankings of the proposed locations, and a determination of how further delivery is to be prioritised.  This review will help us better understand how PCCs are currently used.  It will also allow us to review the characteristics of these facilities to identify the most effective service models.<br\/><br\/>The review will consider the utilisation of centres and how this would increase as services in the community are expanded, commencing with the Sl&aacute;intecare investment of &euro;10 million that will increase to &euro;60 million.  This will result in to 1,000 additional front-line staff employed in community services.  This work will also insure an integrated system among key HSE stakeholders, and a consistent process for coding primary care teams across the networks and CHOs.<br\/><br\/>Between January and September this year, the HSE provided almost 13 million hours of home support nationally, with an expenditure of more than &euro;320 million.  This service provides essential supports to more than 50,000 people to either remain at home or assist with their discharge from hospital.  Demand for this service continues to outstrip funding levels and at the end of September, 7,667 people nationally were assessed as requiring new or additional services.  The HSE winter plan will continue to support this service by allocating an additional 600 home care packages, targeted at both acute hospital and community waiting lists.<br\/><br\/>Regarding sections 38 and 39 organisations, the HSE recognises and supports the essential work of the voluntary sector in providing health and social services.  We wish to strengthen and deepen the ongoing dialogue between our organisation and the voluntary sector, in line with the recommendations of the Day report.  We acknowledge that a number of voluntary organisations are facing difficult challenges, including financial challenges.  Various factors may contribute to expenditure exceeding the funding level set out in the annual service agreement signed with the HSE, and any overruns arising require careful analysis of the specific causal factors lest they undermine budgetary discipline within the overall health sector.  In the first instance, dealing with any in-year or accumulated historic financial overruns within voluntary organisations, funded under sections 38 and 39, is a matter for the boards of these organisations.  We know their boards take that responsibility seriously.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#PP00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575536400,"counter":1223,"content":"<p>I thank the CEO.

The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is nearly identical to his reports of 2001 and 2010.  We all know that the ambition of primary care is to keep as many people as possible out of hospital and in their homes.  We all know it seeks to ensure that people are cared for and treated as near as possible to their own homes without blocking up the system, taking up hospital beds, etc. particularly in view of the current trolley situation.<\/p> <p>  Governments down through the years have placed great emphasis on primary care and such care has been mentioned in all of the manifestos and by the HSE.

In the reviews, the HSE will be looking at the location, the components of primary care needs in an area, and so on.  This is absolutely the way to go.  We want to see a successful model around the country.  Some of the shortcomings, for example, would be retention of staff.  Would that be the kind of thing that would be part of the review?  I went along to my own CHO area.  It had a briefing for Oireachtas Members that was very useful and addressed a range of areas.  I asked a question about an area that keeps cropping up in the personal experience of some of my constituents.  They get an appointment and then there is an interruption in the therapy service.  It is often maternity leave since a large number of women are employed in that area of healthcare and they absolutely have to be supported in the maternity leave that they take.  They do not want to come back to long lists and such.  The functioning of these primary care centres has to take that into account too.  Is that an aspect that the HSE will look at?  I understand that, at any given time, one third of therapists are on maternity leave, which is a very high number.  That goes with the territory when one has a cohort of workers with that age profile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019120500002#UU02600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575536400,"counter":1365,"content":"<p>I will come back on two aspects, some of which relates to Deputy O'Connell's question too.

We want to have that aspect of the review done in the first half of next year because it is key.<\/p><p> The second aspect of the review, which Deputies O'Connell and Catherine Murphy just mentioned, is to proof it against Sl&aacute;intecare.  Part of the proposal that went to the Government about the announcement of regions was that we would revert to the Government in the first half of next year about the functioning and establishment of regions and real, integrated operational care between acute and primary care.  How we use primary care centres must be a key aspect of our next report.  The history of primary care centres is long, going back to the health board system and through the nine CHO settings.  We need to look at them as much more of an integrated service which is a very different way of looking at them.  It might mean a reassessment of priorities.<\/p><p> The second part of the question related to the staff and therapists in general.  If one stands back from the Deputy's point, it is absolutely correct.  Some 80% of our staffing, across the HSE, are women and approximately 35% of staff are on reduced working hours, maternity leave, or work part-time, etc.  It is a significant issue to manage and, much of the time, we have to manage it through agency because it would not be cost-effective to have all full-time replacements.  We meet certain pinch points when it comes to resourcing.  Maternity leave also affects some of the primary care centres.  We try to cover some of the vacancies through agency or by moving staff between primary care teams.  It is an issue that is difficult to manage.

Multidisciplinary working changes that slightly.  It does not mean that we magic up capacity that we do not have but it does mean that families and children coming through primary care centres, whether attending the primary care team, children's disability teams or whatever, are familiar with the team and there is less of a gap when an individual member of staff is lost.

It appears that &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million per annum may not be in the framework due to the passage of time.  The letter also states that payments would be made to service providers who are not party to the framework agreement.  This cost is running at an average of &euro;2.5 million per year.  As they are not part of the framework, these payments are clearly not compliant.  Mr. Reid has said the main ones are compliant.  I query whether they are compliant given that the roll-over period has concluded.  On 25 May 2017, the HSE advertised for tenders to replace the current framework.  This has gone on for a long time.  I have had correspondence from people who are very competent.  They might be subcontractors for some of the companies approved by the HSE.  They are legitimately trying to get on to the list.  The most recent letter I received as from the HSE's national director of procurement.  He skirts around the current competition but the letter states that, due to competing priorities in the past 12 months with planning for CervicalCheck and Brexit planning, the HSE did not have the resources to replace the existing framework agreement and it has not been processed.  However, it will examine the market position in early 2020 and will either progress the existing competition - it would be hard to resurrect because it is now three years old - or relaunch a procurement process with a view to establishing a new framework next year.  The HSE has been in the tendering process for three years and my reading of the letter is that it might be abandoned and a new one started.  What is going on?  I am not talking about &euro;1 million here or there but several million euro every year.  Part of this should be covered by the framework.  Having been two years in the process, the HSE is now putting its hands up and potentially abandoning the tendering process.  This is what it reads like to me.

We can give an update on that.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Connor referred to an exercise that is looking at disability and mental health residential placements around the appropriateness, procurement, cost, effectiveness and value in placements.

People are reluctant to complain because they see the person on behalf of whom they are complaining as a vulnerable person.  It is all the more important that the questioning is one step removed from the individuals.

That is a key component in what we are looking at as well.<\/p> <p>  On the value for money question, people are placed in what we call an emergency placement, if things break down at home, or whatever happens.  They are left in this placement that can often be very high cost and highly-supported.  We are bringing in a new system of reviewing all of these placements.  That is under way.  We have worked through many different placements to look at the appropriateness of the placement, its oversight, whether there is a different type of placement that would meet that person's needs in a better way, where it is in relation to local community and family, and all of that.

The reality is that we often have people who have highly specialised needs.  We would not be able to keep those services going in respect of staffing, etc.  We rely on private providers who often specialise in a specific condition.  Our challenge is to ensure that we respond in a more agile way to people's needs.  Just because people go into a placement one day does not mean that they should have the same staffing and remain in the same place forever.  We must ensure we have a system of reviewing placements to meet their changing needs.  This is particularly the case if they go in when they are younger and grow older, or their condition changes, or whatever.  Many things can change.  The idea is that we look at getting the most appropriate care setting.<\/p> <p>  There is definitely a value for money component.  Sometimes we find that three or four CHOs may be dealing with one provider, unaware that the other CHOs are also talking to the provider.  This impacts on the cost and staffing levels.  We are trying to join all of that up nationally to make sure that when we are talking to a provider, particularly where there might be three or four people in a house funded by different areas, that we bring all of that together and look at its appropriateness.
