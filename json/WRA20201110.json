My Department, and the enterprise agencies under my remit, are doing everything possible to sustain businesses and get our people safely back to work in all parts of our country.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the best way to attract further foreign direct investment to Kerry is to continue\u00a0assisting IDA Ireland in their efforts to generate new investments and jobs to the County. I am pleased to say that\u00a0FDI levels in Kerry have improved significantly in recent years.\u00a0There are\u00a018 IDA client companies\u00a0in County Kerry employing approximately 2,200 people. Since 2012, Kerry has witnessed a 34% increase in employment in overseas companies. The County\u00a0has maintained a\u00a0strong reputation as a successful home to firms\u00a0from the\u00a0Pharmaceutical and Business Services sectors.\u00a0Companies like Central Pharma, Sigmar Recruitment and Astellas are all located there and continue to perform well.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of recent investments, JRI America announced in May 2019 that it is to expand its technology centre in Tralee, which will create up to 100 new jobs.\u00a0Central Pharma is also in the process of expanding in Tralee following its announcement in December 2018 that it will create 100 new positions by establishing a contract packaging and supply centre at the IDA&rsquo;s Advanced Technology Building in Tralee.<\/p>  <p>  These projects are significant investments for County Kerry which will create a substantial number of jobs. The IDA will continue to draw the attention of multinational firms looking to invest or expand in Kerry and the South-West region. The Agency also owns marketable lands in Tralee and Killarney and these sites are being actively marketed by the IDA through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these positive developments, I appreciate that these are still difficult times.\u00a0 BorgWarner&rsquo;s decision to close its facility in Tralee is very disappointing.\u00a0 Since the closure announcement, IDA Ireland has fully engaged with the company both in Tralee and its Corporate Headquarters to explore options to market the facility and its skilled workforce and to highlight the range of supports available to impacted employees. \u00a0As difficult as it may be to appreciate right now, we have reason to be confident that we will find new investment and new opportunities for the employees of BorgWarner and for Tralee.<\/p>  <p>COVID-19 and the introduction of travel restrictions has disrupted the typical way that IDA engages with investors. The IDA are working on alternative approaches and their new strategy, due shortly, will focus on how FDI can have greatest impact on our economic recovery. My Department is also focused on regional development and how we ensure FDI can grow in a sustainable and inclusive way.\u00a0 Strengthening FDI\u00a0and indigenous enterprises will feature strongly in the forthcoming National Economic Plan.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000061#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Centres","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000061#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[34991\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000061#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the discussions his officials have had with IDA Ireland with regard to the development of data centres in line with the policy of locating them in areas with grid capacity and only in cases in which there is an employment dividend associated with their development; if an evaluation has been conducted by his Department of the estimated impact of all 55 current data centres and the over 30 planned data centres on the cost of electricity to other commercial and industrial users; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>Data centres are an increasingly important part of the digital and communications sectors and a core infrastructure for remote working.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since the publication of the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Policy&rsquo;, in\u00a0June 2018, IDA Ireland has been promoting regional options for data centre investments.

A further five in-person visits and three E-visits have taken place as of the second quarter of this year.<\/p><p>The reduced number of site visits in 2020, as the Deputy will appreciate, is mainly attributable to the introduction of international travel restrictions related to Covid-19. Those restrictions have, amongst other things, led to the cancellation or postponement of scheduled IDA site visits and client meetings in every region of the country, including counties Meath and the Westmeath. As an alternative to site visits, the IDA has migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. The Agency has developed new digital content and has also put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the difficulties presented by the pandemic, site visits do remain an important means by which the IDA can showcase regional locations &ndash; including Meath and Westmeath&ndash; to prospective investors. At the same time, we must recognise that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the overseas company concerned. It is also the case, no matter what efforts we make to underline the undoubted benefits of regional locations, that certain firms will only consider investing in large urban areas for various commercial or operational reasons.  <\/p><p>More broadly, it&rsquo;s clear the FDI will have an important role to play &ndash; across Ireland &ndash; as we seek to recover from the damage caused by Covid-19.

It sets out the strategic importance of data centres to Ireland&rsquo;s overarching enterprise policy and attracting foreign investment in the ICT sector. The Statement followed an agreement of the Government, in October 2017, to create a strategic policy framework to support the continued development of data centres in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Work has been undertaken by IDA Ireland to identify suitable sites in the regions for developing data centres including suitability of grid capacity and the potential for development in regional locations. The Government is seeking to ensure that the costs of growing energy demand are minimised. We do this by encouraging data centre investments in regions where we have infrastructure capacity to facilitate investments of this scale and also where they contribute to regional development.

I take it that the scheme referred to by the Deputy would guarantee gift vouchers issued by a business that went into liquidation or ceased trading. While the aim of enhancing consumer confidence in gift vouchers is understandable, the introduction of a scheme of this kind would raise substantial practical and policy issues.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, tour operators and travel agents who provide packages or linked travel arrangements are required to provide security for the refund of payments made for packages that are not subsequently performed due to insolvency.  This security can take the form of a bond in the case of licensed travel agents or tour operators, or of an insurance policy. The required level of insolvency protection is determined by reference to the turnover of the tour operator or travel agent and entails significant costs for these businesses. The oversight of the insolvency protection arrangements for the 223 tour operators and travel agents currently covered by these arrangements also involves a substantial administrative and regulatory function for the Commission for Aviation Regulation. Introducing a similar insolvency protection regime for the large number of gift vouchers issued by businesses would be a significant regulatory undertaking. It would also be costly, and so is not a step that could be taken quickly or without detailed consideration and consultation.  <\/p>  <p>  If the State were to guarantee gift vouchers then there would be a considerable liability on the State as well as a costly and substantial regulatory and administrative workload perhaps requiring the details and registration of every gift voucher issued by every business in the State. A State guarantee for gift vouchers would also privilege gift vouchers over other types of prepayments made by consumers such as deposits for goods, annual subscriptions for services such as gyms, or payments to savings and Christmas clubs. It is reasonable to ask why gift vouchers would be protected against insolvency while other, and in many cases, larger prepayments made by consumers would not enjoy similar protections.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not know of any jurisdiction that has a guarantee scheme of this kind. In 2015-2016, the English Law Commission considered whether businesses should be required to provide protection for gift vouchers. It concluded that the economic burden of such a requirement on businesses would be disproportionate to the benefits that consumers might receive in return. It further held that the case for giving preferential protection to gift voucher holders over other unsecured creditors had not been convincingly made.<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons, I have no plans to introduce such a scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000062#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000062#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[35061\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000062#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"if the restart plus grant will be expanded for marine based activity providers that do not pay rates but pay harbour and mooring fees to Cork County Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>The Restart Grant Plus scheme which launched on 10 August 2020, is now closed to new applications since 31 October 2020.

I am determined, together with IDA Ireland, to increase these numbers further as best we can.  <\/p>  <p>  The IDA has a strong focus on regional development, including for the South-East.

At the same time, we must recognise that the final decision as to where to invest rests solely with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential or job creation, as a significant proportion of all new FDI comes from existing IDA clients already present in the country. <\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, IDA Ireland will continue to draw the attention of multinationals looking to invest or expand in County Carlow.

Delivering our increased ambition to 2030 will require a doubling of effort from that set out in the 2019 Climate Action Plan.    The 2019 Climate Action Plan represented an annual average emissions reduction of 3.5% on an economy-wide basis, and indicated how this effort would be allocated across sectors in the non-ETS Sector (Transport, Energy, Built Environment, Industry). This included increased reliance on renewables from 30% to 70%, accelerated shift to EVs with target of 950,000 EVs on the road by 2030 and retrofits to approximately 500,000 homes of B2 BER rating.

These measures will be coupled with emerging technological means developed and identified over time. <\/p>  <p>  The increased scale and depth of our climate ambition is consistent with the approach being discussed at EU level. Both domestically and at EU level, it is recognised that we are not yet in a position to identify all the emerging technologies, changing scientific consensus or policies to meet our full ambition.

It includes a number of legislative proposals, new strategies and action plans, financing instruments and non-legislative initiatives, which span all sectors. In recognition of the investment required to decarbonise our economies, the EU&rsquo;s &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU recovery package and &euro;1 trillion budget require that money can only be spent on projects that meet certain green criteria, with 30% of all funding to go on climate change mitigation. Ireland will seek to maximise the drawdown of its share of this funding.    I have supported increased climate ambition at EU level through the European Green Deal, while asserting the importance of cost-effectiveness and fairness across Member States in pursuit of increased ambition. The Programme for Government has a Green New Deal for Ireland as a core mission. It commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 - a 51% reduction over the decade - and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, the latter being consistent with EU 2050 ambition. The Climate Action (Amendment) Bill, currently in pre-legislative scrutiny, will strengthen the governance structure in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate breakdown, and will set the 2050 decarbonisation target in law. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to far-reaching policy changes across every sector to deliver this expanded and deepened climate ambition including: delivering a National Aggregated Model of Retrofitting reaching over 500,000 homes by 2030 in line with the EU Renovation Wave; a major drive to realise the immense potential of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewables as part of the EU&rsquo;s clean energy transition; and implementing a major Waste and Circular Economy Action Plan also supporting EU ambition in these areas under the European Green Deal. The measures required to achieve this ambition will be set out in an updated Climate Action Plan in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The need for a socially just transition must be reflected in policies at EU and national level. We are committed to ensuring that no sector of society or community is left behind in the movement to a low-carbon future. The Just Transition Fund is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s just transition plan for the Midlands region. A 2020 fund of &euro;11 million is available for projects focusing on retraining workers and proposals to generate sustainable employment in green enterprise in the region, and supporting communities to transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of national financing more generally, &euro;30.4 billion is allocated for investment in climate action over the lifetime of Ireland's National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027. As part of the July Jobs Stimulus Plan, to help businesses adapt to the green economy, &euro;10 million will be provided to support businesses engaging in green research, development and innovation, capital investment, and capacity building, through the first phase of a new Green Enterprise Fund. Budget 2021 funding reflects this Government&rsquo;s ambition for a green, jobs-led recovery. In total, across Government, &euro;286.5 million has been committed to retrofit activity, and &euro;1.8 billion funding was announced for sustainable transport, cycling, walking, and greenways. The Government has announced review of the National Development Plan, which will look at the appropriate amounts of funding across various areas such as climate action, housing and transport, and will be consistent with the Programme for Government.\u200b<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is preparing a National Recovery and Resilience Plan to be submitted to the European Commission by 30 April 2021 in order to receive funding under the EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Facility.

The report contains important recommendations. The Government is already acting on a number of these and is committed to preparing an implementation plan to address the remainder, which I intend to publish in the coming weeks. The recommendations and associated actions will support job creation efforts and create new opportunities for Bord na M&oacute;na workers in the Midlands.   In relation to the recommendation that relevant public bodies with a presence in the region identify land and facilities which could be of interest for alternative green enterprises, the Government&rsquo;s initial response to the Commissioner&rsquo;s report noted the extensive range of green energy projects underway or proposed in the Midlands, including the Lumcloon battery storage project, the Rhode Energy Business Park, and several other developments by Bord na Mona, the ESB and others. This initial response committed to further engagement with State agencies and enterprises to identify land and facilities which could be used for further such projects. <\/p>  <p>  A number of other actions, already underway, will also support the objective of this recommendation. <\/p>  <p>  Following a commitment in the Programme for Government, a feasibility study into the establishment of a Green Energy Hub, using the existing infrastructure in the West Offaly and Lough Ree power plants, has now commenced. This is being overseen by a Steering Group chaired by the ESB, and includes representatives of my Department, relevant Local Authorities, and the Just Transition Commissioner.

We have committed &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund to promote further public charging, in particular fast charging, and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. My Department also provides support through the SEAI for an EV Public Charge Point Grant to Local Authorities to install charge points on public streets or public car parks which provide overnight car parking for local residents. A total of 75% of the capital costs is provided through the grant, up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per charge point. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2021, my Department has allocated &euro;2 million to the SEAI to facilitate the introduction of a new support scheme for destination chargers to support the installation of chargers in locations such as hotels, shopping centres, visitor attractions or places of employment. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that businesses can also avail of accelerated capital allowances for the purchase and installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This enables businesses to invest in energy efficient equipment, including electric charging infrastructure, and write down the cost of such equipment in the year of purchase rather than over 8 years.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Emissions Vehicle Task Force Phase 1 report made recommendations to issue guidance to planning authorities to ensure a consistent and future-proofed approach to the rollout of EV charging infrastructure through planning decisions, such as ensuring that traditional filling stations provide charging for EVs. In supporting future development and the installation of charge points it should also be noted that the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2018\/844\/EU) requires Member States to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is installed in all new residential buildings and non-residential buildings, as well as those buildings with more than 10 parking spaces, for the purpose of enabling the installation at a later stage of charging points for electric vehicles (EVs) in such developments. It is intended that this EU requirement will be transposed into Irish law by end 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the schemes outlined above, the Department of Transport is also undertaking an EV SPSV Charger Project which will see the installation of SPSV-dedicated EV chargers at Dublin and Cork Airports and train stations in Dublin (Heuston), Limerick (Colbert) and Cork (Kent).

It is clear however that local authorities are facing some challenges around planning and operational matters which can be potentially complex with respect to installing charging infrastructure in appropriate locations. The Department is working closely with the sector and other key stakeholders on the issues concerned and while uptake to date under the SEAI scheme has been slow thus far, I fully expect this to change in the months ahead as local authorities look to adopt a more strategic approach for how they will avail of the generous grants that are available under the public charge point scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Local Government has been to the forefront in recent times in addressing the climate challenge and the sector will have a key role to play in helping to decarbonise our national fleet through facilitating the provision of EV charging infrastructure in appropriate locations at both the local and regional level. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In this regard it should be noted that my Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, on developing a strategy to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand.

The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. The funding should allow for 5,800 lower income households to receive upgrades next year. <\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need.

Given its export intensity, the manufacturing sector is very reliant on international trade flows and functioning global supply chains and on recovery in EU and global markets.  Wider external economic and policy developments will also affect prospects for the sector and there is a longer-term risk of countries seeking to repatriate their supply chains to avoid the risk of future pandemic related disruption. <\/p>  <p>  Manufacturing has a significant vulnerability in terms of international competition and, for multinationals, intra-corporate competition.  Connectivity is crucial and the sector is emphasising the need for a system allowing international travel at the earliest opportunity.  <\/p>  <p>  Supporting digital transformation of the manufacturing sector and its supply chain under Ireland&rsquo;s Industry 4.0 Strategy will underpin the competitiveness of the manufacturing base into the future to support recovery and drive productivity. <\/p>  <p>  The services sector is broad and spans multiple subsectors.  Broadly the internationally traded services sectors, including financial and business services sectors have remained relatively stable with the vast majority of companies effectively transitioning to remote working.  Others, including aviation and locally traded services sectors that require close proximity with customers including hospitality and food services as well as personal services, remain more vulnerable to the impact of restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Pandemic Unemployment Payment data indicates that services sectors dependent on close proximity remain most impacted. Hospitality, retail and administrative and support services, accounted for 54% of PUP claimants as of November 3rd. Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) data also shows the high impact on hospitality and retail, with 30% and 11% respectively of employments supported by the scheme from those sectors.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.\u00a0<\/p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 4 November 2020, almost 122,000 premises across 25 counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company.\u00a0In Kerry, townlands\u00a0have been\u00a0surveyed around Killarney including Muckross, Fossa, Kilcummin, Lissivigeen, Ballycasheen, Faha, Firies and Ballyhar. Surveying is ongoing in Tralee, Curraheen, Abbeydorney, Kilflynn, Firies, Castlemaine and Ardfert.\u00a0This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. <\/p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are expected next month in Carrigaline, Co Cork\u00a0and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.\u00a0Further details are available on specific areas within\u00a0Kerry through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website . \u00a0Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. <\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP and will provide high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of the 30 October, some 187 BCP sites have been installed by NBI with 59 already connected. The high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills (DES) for schools. <\/p><p>Valentia Cable Station and Chapeltown BCPs are now live. Further BCPs installed by NBI and awaiting connectivity in Kerry include Gneeveguilla (Tureencahill), Railway Station Heritage Centre and Community Space, Killenagh, Kielduff Community Centre, and\u00a0Cill&iacute;n Liath.\u00a0I note that Kielduff Community Centre is 8 kilometres from the premises referred to in the Question\u00a0and this may be of assistance pending the rollout of the National Broadband Plan. Further details can be found at\u00a0https:\/\/nbi.ie\/bcp-locations\/.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A number of schools in\u00a0Kerry including Boheeshil National School, Dunloe Upper and Coars National School have been installed by NBI and\u00a0will be connected to high speed broadband as part of the BCP initiative in the coming months.\u00a0My Department will work with Department of Education and Skills\u00a0to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP.While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.<\/p><p>In April 2020, all major telecommunications providers committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Since then, a number of operators have\u00a0implemented further supports for consumers, such as for students in\u00a0 education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many\u00a0existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. The\u00a0market for mobile\u00a0packages with very high, or unlimited data\u00a0offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive and this is positive for all consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000070#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Recycling Policy","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000070#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[34908\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000070#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the initiatives being planned to promote recycling in multi-dwelling complexes in which such options are not now available.","asker":"1549","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>I refer the\u00a0reply to Question 23 of 4 November 2020.<\/p><p>The <i>Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy<\/i>, which I launched in September this year, contains a commitment to deliver behavioural change campaigns for individuals, businesses and the public sector to encourage improved waste segregation and recycling.\u00a0 The plan contains the following specific commitments in relation to waste collection for apartment dwellers:<\/p><p>- We will work with relevant stakeholders to improve waste segregation in apartment complexes;<\/p><p>- We will develop a quality waste management assurance scheme for businesses - including apartments serviced by management companies;<\/p><p>- We will work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make regulatory changes in planning and tenancy laws to ensure apartment dwellers are provided with infrastructure to support food waste segregation. <\/p><p>Work has already commenced in determining which stakeholders are needed to progress these commitments and an initial\u00a0stakeholder engagement with representative organisations\u00a0is planned before the end of the year.\u00a0 Work has\u00a0already taken place with some local authorities examining the issues around managing waste in apartments.\u00a0 In addition, the incorporation of recycling targets into waste collection permits will incentivise the waste collection industry to drive enhanced waste\u00a0segregation including for apartment complexes. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000070#WRL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000070#WRL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[35030\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000070#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if grants are available for a new roof and energy efficient works for persons refurbishing an old house in a rural area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>The SEAI operates a number of energy efficiency upgrade schemes on behalf of my Department.These schemes include\u00a0partial grants for individuals that can afford to contribute to the cost of energy efficiency upgrades as well as schemes that provide\u00a0free energy efficiency improvements for people who are in receipt of certain welfare payments.\u00a0\u00a0Information on the grant levels available by scheme\u00a0is available from the SEAI on 1850 250 204 or their website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/i>Grants are available for a range of measures\u00a0including:<\/p><p>- Attic insulation<\/p><p>- Wall insulation (cavity wall, drylining or external insulation)<\/p><p>- Heat pump installation<\/p><p>- Heating controls<\/p><p>- Solar thermal panels for hot water<\/p><p>- Solar PV panels for electricity generation<\/p><p>- Window and door replacement<\/p><p>SEAI grant schemes will be a central element of the Government&rsquo;s approach to achieving our\u00a0national retrofit\u00a0targets.

The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities.

This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that the 2030 target will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  These developments at EU level, along with the step change in climate ambition set out in the Programme for Government, will need to be reflected appropriately in the next iteration of the Climate Action Plan.

While the achievement of such improvements is not addressed in current EU policy, the Programme for Government commits to seeking to incentivise land use in the European Green Deal and broader EU policy. It also commits to evaluating, within 24 months, the potential contributions towards our climate ambition from land-use improvements and set in train the development of a land-use plan, based on these findings. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that the next Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) protects farm incomes and sectoral supports consistent these objectives, and the National Economic Plan frontloads investment that is directly aligned with our climate ambition. The Programme for Government has also committed to allocating &euro;1.5 billion, of the hypothecated additional carbon tax revenue, to a REPS-2 programme to encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way. This funding will be additional to funding from the CAP. It will include incentives to plant native forestry and to enhance and support biodiversity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[35411\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which he has had discussions with employer or employee groups with a view to achieving reduced commuter traffic and thereby helping to achieve carbon reduction targets without loss of employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to a programme of climate action that is essential if we are to address the climate crisis that threatens our safe future on this planet.\u00a0 The Programme for Government commits to an average\u00a07% per annum reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0over the next ten years.\u00a0 This step-change in ambition will be challenging and require fundamental changes in so many parts of Irish life, but I believe that Ireland can and will rise to this challenge.

Bus &Eacute;ireann (B&Eacute;) operates a substantial PSO business under contract with the NTA, providing subvented bus servcies both in the cities outside Dublin, and in regional and rural locations throughout the country.  B&Eacute; also has a separate, commercially-run business, \"Expressway\", which operates a number of inter-regional bus routes in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market.  The recent B&Eacute; announcement relates to routes operated by its commercial Expressway business.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenues.  The negative impact of Covid on the public transport system has been mitigated by several Government decisions particularly:<\/p>  <p>  - to substantially increase the 2020 budget for the existing PSO system;<\/p>  <p>  - to introduce new temporary financial support for non-PSO licensed services provided by commercial bus operators; and<\/p>  <p>  - enhancements to certain PSO bus services announced under the Stimulus package.<\/p>  <p>  The temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector were introduced for a period of up to six months, in accordance with EU and national legislation and apply to routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is administering the support package through new contracts with the relevant commercial operators.<\/p>  <p>  Among the commercially-operated routes that have qualified for support under the temporary scheme are most, but not all, of B&Eacute;'s \"Expressway\" services.  Notwithstanding these supports, though, the Covid situation has still had a profound impact on the company's financial situation, that the Board of the company is obliged to address.  Therefore, B&Eacute; has developed plans to address its critical financial situation by reducing the size of its commercial Expressway business over time in order to focus on the profitable routes. The decision by the B&Eacute; Board to consolidate its Expressway route network was taken following extensive work within the company.  The Board has decided to indefinitely suspend the Dublin\/Belfast service and, in the coming months, to cease services on the Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Galway routes.  The Board decision will consolidate the commercial Expressway routes from 18 to 14.  The company's decisions do not affect the over 200 routes that Bus &Eacute;ireann operates under its normal PSO contract arrangements with the NTA;  these will all continue as before.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been assured by the company that there will be no job losses as a result of its decision and that affected staff will be redeployed to new\/enhanced PSO services which were announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus Package.  In this regard, B&Eacute; plans to introduce new bus services in Galway, Limerick, Cork as well as Louth and Meath, which will require more than 100 drivers<\/p>  <p>  As regards the regional connectivity consequences of the B&Eacute; decision, I would like to reassure the Deputy that I have asked the NTA to assess any potential loss of connectivity along particular segments of the routes to ensure there are no gaps in the network, and to assess if there is a need to provide any additional services.  The Government is committed to ensuring that essential transport services are protected and supported and that services continue to provide vital regional and rural connections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN05800"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[34671\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN05900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if there will be additional buses or trains added to the existing timetables during the current round of level 5 restrictions to account for the reduction to 25% of capacity and the impact this is having on commuting workers that are unable to access public transport; the number of additional services provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[34925\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN06000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if additional buses will be introduced on routes to match normal capacity in view of the Covid-19 restrictions in place in Dublin Bus and a company (details supplied) that have reduced their capacity to 25%.","asker":"1476","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":591,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 274 together.<\/p><p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. <\/p><p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and public transport has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank both all operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services safely during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.<\/p><p>The Government's new &quot;Living with Covid&quot; Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the new Plan.  The Plan provides guidance for the public about using public transport at the different risk levels;  including that wearing face coverings is mandatory, and encouraging use of off-peak services and sustainable active travel alternative options where feasible.  <\/p><p>Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including frontline workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  <\/p><p>Since the move to level 5, the NTA and bus operators in Dublin (Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland), have re-allocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas where they were experiencing capacity issues.<\/p><p>Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since October 22<sup>nd<\/sup>to help mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops. Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures have also assisted in reducing passengers' wait times at stops. Currently, all available vehicles are in use, so whilst the re-allocation will ease the situation, it remains the case that there will still be instances of people having to wait for another bus. <\/p><p>The NTA continues to monitor the effects of the reduction in capacity very closely in conjunction with public transport operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN06200"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[34673\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN06300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the costs of closure and replacement of the six level crossings on the Maynooth line proposed in the DART plus west proposals; the costs on a comparative basis of retaining automated level crossings following resignalling to facilitate electrified rail; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":594,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[35442\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000072#WRN06400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if public consultations have happened regarding the proposed Maynooth DART project; and if so, the means that were used to ensure contact has been made with persons living near the railways and the geographical extent either side of the railways by which notice was given to the surrounding populations in Dublin city.","asker":"1560","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":595,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 and 291 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputies are aware, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area including, in consultation with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, implementation of the DART+ Programme.<\/p><p>DART+ will effectively double the capacity of the existing network.

This is an\u00a0initiative of the German Presidency of the Council of the EU that promotes innovation,\u00a0automation and smart connectivity, shared European data spaces, and the increased digitalisation in mobility.

Public transport is provided on an open basis for all members of the public, and its availability does not distinguish between schoolchildren, students, and other passengers.  Indeed, under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 the definition of a &lsquo;public bus passenger service&rsquo; excludes the National Transport Authority (NTA) from licensing or providing services for carrying children to or from school. Consequently, the NTA does not manage the delivery of dedicated school transport services. As the Deputy will be aware, the School Transport Scheme (STS) - which is separate from the public transport system, and which operates predominantly in rural areas - comes under the remit of the Department of Education, and is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on their behalf.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.   Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and it has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government's new \"Living with Covid\" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the new Plan.  The Plan provides guidance for the public about using public transport at the different risk levels;  including that wearing face coverings is mandatory, and encouraging use of off-peak services and sustainable active travel alternative options where feasible.  <\/p>  <p>  Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and public transport has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank both all operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services safely during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including front-line workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the move to level 5, the NTA and bus operators in Dublin (Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland), have re-allocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas where they were experiencing capacity issues.<\/p>  <p>Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since October 22nd   to help mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops. Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures have also assisted in reducing passengers' wait times at stops. Currently, all available vehicles are in use, so whilst the re-allocation will ease the situation, it remains the case that there will still be instances of people having to wait for another bus. <\/p>  <p>  The NTA continues to monitor the effects of the reduction in capacity very closely in conjunction with public transport operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000073#WRO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Shannon Airport Facilities","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000073#WRO04400"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[35232\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000073#WRO04500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 801 of 27 May 2020, the number of US troops and the quantity of weapons and munitions that have passed through Shannon Airport in each of the months May to October 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[35233\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000073#WRO04600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to continue the practice of providing exemptions under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order for US military contracted plans to take weapons through Shannon and Irish airspace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 280 together.<\/p><p>The 1944 Chicago Convention is the main treaty governing international civil aviation.

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>The CRSS was announced on Budget day and the operational details are being worked though as quickly as possible.  The scheme will be implemented by the Revenue Commissioners who have shown as an organisation that they are very effective in operating schemes to support businesses in this crisis.<\/p><p>A two-step process is necessary to make a claim under the CRSS. The qualifying person must first register for CRSS on Revenue Online Service&rsquo; (ROS) and then complete a claim in respect of a claim period or claim periods. Revenue have been accepting registrations for the scheme since 1 November, and claims will be accepted from mid-November with payments made shortly thereafter.<\/p><p>The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.<\/p><p>Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme.  Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.<\/p><p>Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. <\/p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as a track bookmaker or tour operator, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) or a business in the tourism sector carrying on a trade consisting of, for example, the operation of a gallery or other cultural attraction, located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.<\/p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.<\/p><p>It is not sufficient that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.  <\/p><p>I would also point out that the CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.<b><\/b>Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support  particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":702,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03200"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[35397\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress being made in ensuring that persons can once again access a primary medical certificate; and if his attention has been drawn to the impact that this is having on the mobility and independence for those awaiting such certificates for cars.","asker":"1460","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[34831\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 80 of 17 September 2020, the policy or legislative changes he plans to make to the Disabled Drivers Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and the related primary medical certificates following the Supreme Court ruling of 18 June 2020.","asker":"1463","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[35143\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when new legislation will be ready to be published to enable new primary medical certificates to issue for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concession) scheme in view of the Supreme Court Judgement of 18 June 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296, 313 and 321 together.<\/p><p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from VRT and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant. The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. <\/p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.<\/p><p>The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:<\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; <\/p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p><p>- be without one or both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  <\/p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th<\/sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. <\/p><p>The Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.  <\/p><p>In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p><p>My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. <\/p><p>While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-commence based on a firm legal basis.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03700"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[35172\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the increase in the carbon tax has been subject to a human rights and equality impact assessment as required under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 with particular consideration for the vulnerability of members of the Travelling community to energy and transport poverty, particularly those living in very poor quality and or substandard housing and caravans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>In line with the 2020 Programme for Government policy approach, the Budget 2021 carbon tax increase is informed by research conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute of Ireland (ESRI).   <\/p>  <p>  The ESRI research paper, &ldquo;Carbon Taxes, Poverty and Compensation Options&rdquo; found that the carbon tax could be increased in a progressive manner, with impacts on lower-income deciles and poverty offset through additional spending on social welfare supports. Specifically, the ESRI found that by recycling one third of the revenue raised from a &euro;7.50 increase in the carbon tax, the lowest income deciles can be left on average better off and poverty reduced.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the findings of this research, the Government has committed to very significant increases in a targeted package of social protection supports. These supports were selected to counteract the impact of the increased carbon tax, as identified by the ESRI. The specific measures are:<\/p>  <p>  - An increase to the a Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12 and &euro;5 per week for children over 12 - This protects low income families and will reduce child poverty;<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;5 per week - People living alone are often the elderly most at risk of poverty or people living with a disability. These groups are likely to have higher energy needs than average;<\/p>  <p>  - An increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;3.50 per week - This will compensate a broad range of lower income households (since the Fuel Allowance is means-tested) for the additional energy costs they are likely to incur due to an increase in the carbon tax.<\/p>  <p>  The ESRI research indicates that interventions of this nature will reverse the regressive impact of the carbon tax and will actually lead to a reduction in overall poverty, particularly child poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":710,"content":"<p>Question No. 298 answered with Question No. 294.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP04100"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[34544\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a moratorium on the payment of interest will be considered in a case (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>Revenue acts as the collection agent for the Health Service Executive (HSE) in respect of outstanding liabilities arising from the Ancillary State Support Scheme (Fair Deal). <\/p>  <p>  The repayment date for monies loaned under the scheme is laid down in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Collection and Recovery of Repayable Amounts) Regulations 2009-Statutory Instrument No. 436 of 2009.

Under existing rules, when the UK becomes a third country, visitors from Britain will be able to avail of the scheme.  No minimum threshold currently applies in respect of expenditure on which VAT relief may be claimed.    <\/p>  <p>  If the scheme applies to visitors from Britain post-Brexit and if the UK were to operate a similar scheme for EU visitors, Irish consumers would be able to buy goods VAT free in Britain and visitors from Britain would be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases in both directions, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses; purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues and collecting VAT on goods in excess of personal importation allowances brought into Ireland by consumers would be extremely difficult. The UK has announced its intention to exclude EU visitors from their Retail Export Scheme. It was always my intention to adopt reciprocal measures in Ireland to the greatest extent possible if the UK adopted such restrictions and that remains my position.  These restrictions, in Ireland and Britain, will help avoid tax driven displacement of consumer spending and protect tax revenues. Revenue has also advised that with the volume of travel normally between Britain and Ireland, and the volume of Retail Export Scheme claims that would be likely to arise, there would be significant scope for abuse, with purchases of goods for use in Ireland presented as being for export.  <\/p>  <p>  The measures contained in the Brexit Bill do not eliminate the use of the VAT Retail Export Scheme for UK residents, post Brexit.  Instead, they provide a legal basis to control and minimise the scope for abuse of the scheme.  The amended legislation provides that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. I also intend to introduce a requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":729,"content":"<p>Question No. 304 answered with Question No. 294.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":730,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP06000"},{"type":"question","counter":731,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[34608\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000074#WRP06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated number of mortgage arrears by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":732,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that it while it produces mortgage arrears statistics on a quarterly basis, this information is not collated on a county by county basis.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. <\/p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.<\/p><p>The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:<\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; <\/p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p><p>- be without one or both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  <\/p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th<\/sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC.

In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p><p>My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. <\/p><p>While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating.

In regard to the specific issue of new mortgage lending, the three main retail banks assured the T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister McGrath and myself at meetings last July that they were considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which as the Deputy will know replaced the TWSS, is to support employers by helping them to continue trade as they deal with risk arising from COVID-19, and this puts employers in a position to retain key staff and ensure the viability of businesses and firms.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the approach of regulated mortgage lenders on new mortgage lending, the Central Bank has advised that it also expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. As indicated, lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a formal loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.<\/p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":777,"content":"<p>Question No. 326 answered with Question No. 294.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance","counter":778,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ02800"},{"type":"question","counter":779,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[35281\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to implement reforms in view of the increasing cost of car insurance premiums; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":780,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that insurance reform is a key policy priority for this Government.  There are a number of areas that require reform and this is why making progress on these will require a &lsquo;whole-of-Government&rsquo; approach.  This is recognised in the <i>&lsquo;Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future&rsquo;<\/i>document, which lays out commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance.  These include increasing transparency; reviewing duty of care legislation; looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; minimising the scope for questionable claims; and increasing market competition.  Implementation of this agenda has commenced and will be a key issue for Minister Donohoe and myself, as well other members of Cabinet, especially those that will be working on this issue through the recently established Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s Sub-Group on Insurance Reform.  <\/p><p>In my view, two key reforms are required to address the affordability and accessibility of insurance. The first of these is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with other jurisdictions. In this regard the establishment of the Judicial Council last December is very important. It is due to adopt new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum by 31 July 2021.  It is also desirable that these guidelines could play a role in the lowering and consistent application of court award levels.  Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members.  I believe that this is a very important statement and is a commitment this Government intends holding the insurance industry to.  <\/p><p>The second reform is to encourage the greater acceptance by claimants of awards made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB). Last week&rsquo;s National Claims Information Database (NCID) report confirmed that the PIAB settlement amounts are almost identical to those settled through litigation.  A key difference however is the PIAB channel facilitates more time-efficient claim settlement with considerably lower legal costs.  This was always the aim of the PIAB, and its establishment in 2003 led to much lower insurance costs for motorists.  I believe that there is a definite interest in getting more claimants to settle at the PIAB stage &ndash; both for the claimants themselves, but also consumers generally as increased costs for insurance companies are reflected in insurance premiums.  As noted, this is an issue which the Insurance Reform Sub-Group is prioritising and it will consider proposals on enhancing the role of the PIAB.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s statement that &lsquo;the cost of car insurance premiums is increasing&rsquo;, I would draw his attention to data from last week&rsquo;s second NCID <i>Private Motor Insurance Report<\/i>from the Central Bank. This shows that, after peaking in Q2 2018, the earned premium for private motor insurance decreased by 9 per cent up to the end of 2019.  I would reasonably expect that the next year&rsquo;s report will show further reductions in the average earned premiums for private motor insurance into 2020.  Separately, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in its recent September Consumer Price Index (CPI) private motor insurance component shows that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by about 30 per cent from their July 2016 peak.  While for methodological reasons, these datasets are not directly comparable, both have indicated the same downward trend for some time.  <\/p><p>Finally, while I accept that motor insurance may not be decreasing for every individual, I believe it is important to acknowledge that the reforms already introduced by the Cost of Insurance Working Group have had a considerable impact in stabilising the cost of motor insurance and indeed many people should be seeing decreases in the cost of their motor insurance premiums.  The Government intends to build on this success and also focus efforts on increasing both the affordability and availability of insurance for businesses, particularly affecting those SMEs in high-footfall sectors such as hospitality and tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":781,"content":"<p>Question No. 328 answered with Question No. 294.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":782,"content":"<p>Question No. 329 answered with Question No. 303.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wage Subsidy Scheme","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[35433\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a company can send a worker who is in receipt of the wage subsidy scheme or the employment support scheme to another EU country to work during the period they are on the scheme even in cases in which the other EU country was not their original or usual workplace in the period prior to been placed on the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":785,"content":"<p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  The EWSS is an economy-wide enterprise support that focuses primarily on business eligibility.  The scheme provides a subsidy to qualifying employers based on the number of qualifying employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and the level of gross pay paid to such employees. The scheme is not an income support for employees, but is a stand-alone measure to preserve the link between employee and employer and support firm viability through an unprecedented enterprise environment and it is based on clear, objective criteria that may be determined by the Revenue Commissioners.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme has no role in relation to the employer\/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned. Such matters would be expressly outside of the remit of the Revenue Commissioners. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of employer eligibility, the EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the EWSS must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances.  Following such review, if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer will meet the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, namely, at least a 30 per cent reduction in business turnover or customer orders in the period from 1 July to 31 December 2020 by reference to the corresponding 2019 period, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments. Additionally, and unlike the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of the EWSS has been placed under the care and management of Revenue, as was done with its predecessor, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). While Revenue&rsquo;s focus on the EWSS in its early stages is concentrated on getting the scheme up and running and ensuring that all employers who are eligible for subsidy payments receive the payments in a timely manner, I have no doubt but that Revenue will, in due course, undertake an appropriate employer compliance campaign relating to employer eligibility under the EWSS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":787,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[35434\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of companies on the list of companies published in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy scheme; the number of employees who while in receipt of the subsidy had their incomes topped up by the company concerned; and the amounts of these top-ups as a percentage of the employees normal weekly income.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":788,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[35436\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000075#WRQ03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason numerous nursing homes have availed of the wage subsidy scheme for employees; the number of employees in the sector who were placed on the scheme; if these employees worked throughout the period in question; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":789,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331 and 333 together.<\/p><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was administered by Revenue, on behalf of the Government, from 26 March 2020 to 31 August 2020.

This has been achieved by subsidising a portion of the employer wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions.  <\/p>  <p>  Employer eligibility has been determined by reference to change in turnover, a deliberate design feature that has allowed the schemes to be open to all sectors and applied economy wide, while at the same time remain targeted at employers who are considered to be most in need of support.  <\/p>  <p>  The primary qualifying criteria for the EWSS is the &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; and has been specifically designed to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 by requiring a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations.  The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus.<\/p><p>Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease and recognise we can and must prioritise some activities over others. There are naturally difficult choices to be made in which activities to permit.<\/p><p>Under Levels 3, 4 and 5 indoor training that includes dance is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore exercise and dance classes cannot take place.<\/p><p>Under Level 2, indoor dance classes, training and exercise can take place in pods of up to 6 people. <\/p><p>Under Level 1 of the Framework, there is no specific capacity limit, with capacity guided by what can be accommodated safely in the venue while ensuring all protective measures are in place, including social distancing. <\/p><p>The Plan is clear that sectoral guidance also applies and in the case of dance  guidance from Sport Ireland should also be considered:   Until 1 December, Ireland is at Level 5 of the Plan. Under this level the public health risk means that we are all being asked to stay at home and  one  to one music tuition  should take place online with certain exceptions.

This list does not include private or commercial music, drama or dance classes. <\/p><p>Education is considered an essential service under the regulations. Under Part 2 of the schedule to the regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools, and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible.

In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. <\/p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner\/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature.

The OSCE EOM to North Macedonia which had commenced activities on 1 March 2020 was suspended due to the global health emergency and all the election observation personnel already in place were withdrawn. <\/p>  <p>  The rationale for Ireland&rsquo;s decision not to nominate volunteers for EOMs at this time has been outlined in detail in response to Parliamentary Questions No. 396 of 6 October, No. 158 of 15 October, and No. 655 of 3 November.  Upholding the health and safety of all concerned is the overarching priority, feeding into the wider array of factors to be taken into account in considering the nomination of election observers.  The pandemic poses significant risks to the health and safety of election observers, the communities in which election observation would be carried out, and to observers' families and home communities on return.  This requires careful consideration of prevailing public health and overseas travel advice in Ireland; the epidemiological situation in Ireland and abroad; and the particular challenges posed by election observation missions, given extensive travel within the destination country and close contact with residents as well as election observers from other countries. <\/p>  <p>  While the OSCE initially requested nominations for short-term observers (STOs) for elections in Montenegro, Ukraine, Georgia and Republic of Moldova, public health reasons meant the OSCE then reconstituted the missions as a Limited Election Observation Missions (LEOM).  Observers from eleven of the 27 EU Member States participated in these missions.  <\/p>  <p>  Just as national COVID-19 measures more generally are a matter for each Member State of the EU and the OSCE to decide, so too is the decision to participate in election observation missions.  COVID-19 conditions and measures vary widely due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs, along with other concerned Departments and public bodies, participates in the COVID-19 Senior Officials Group coordinated by Department of An Taoiseach. This working group is concerned with ensuring the operation and services of Departments and public bodies are aligned with the COVID-19 (Level 5) framework currently in place.  In the event that the possibility of resuming nomination to international election observation missions is likely, that group would be the proper forum for broader consultation to consider the risks to public health as outlined above.  I look forward to a return to nominating potential Irish election observers as soon as the public health situation prudently allows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000078#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Israeli Settlements","counter":974,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000078#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":975,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[34889\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000078#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the approval by the higher planning council of the Israeli Civil Administration of an additional 4,948 settlement units; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":976,"content":"<p><font color=\"#323232\">I am aware of the development raised by the Deputy and I commented on the matter in a statement on 16 October 2020.

This project is expected to be completed in 22 months i.e. by July 2023.<\/p>  <p>  - Greystones Community College - this new school was established in 2020 as a regional solution for the Kilcoole\/Greystones area. The proposal is to provide permanent accommodation for 1,000 pupils in the school when it is fully developed. Discussions are ongoing with the landowner of a designated site at Charlesland, Greystones, with a view to acquiring the site to construct the new school. <\/p>  <p>  Greystones Community College opened its doors to 64 first year pupils in September 2020 in interim accommodation in Greystones Lawn Tennis Club. My Department is looking at all potential options in the area in the short and medium term ahead of the school&rsquo;s move to its designated permanent site in Charlesland, Greystones. This will include the provision of appropriate temporary accommodation, including specialist rooms, as quickly as possible as the current school year progresses. My officials will continue to work closely with Kildare and Wicklow ETB and the school to ensure that the needs of the school community are met. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is the existing school in the adjacent Kilcoole School Planning Area, Col&aacute;iste Chraobh Abhann, which currently has accommodation for 750 pupils and for which there is a major project approved to expand the school to 1,000 pupils. This project is in early architectural planning and is being delivered by the National Development Finance Agency.

The safety and wellbeing of staff, students and the whole school community has been of paramount importance in the Government&rsquo;s planning for school reopening.  Planning for school reopening was undertaken in close consultation and discussion with key education partners. Since schools reopened, that intensive stakeholder engagement has continued on a weekly basis with senior officials in my Department and representatives of trade unions and management bodies.  The views of stakeholders, including the ASTI, have been taken into consideration at every stage of the process, including the emphasis on a Public Health led approach. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has been working closely with the Department of Health and the HSE to achieve our shared objective to keep schools and staff and students safe.  In order to maintain confidence amongst teachers and other staff, children and their parents, public health doctors have committed to a weekly engagement with key trade union representatives and management body representatives.  This weekly engagement is being facilitated by my Department and this forum will allow all parties to exchange information, to progress appropriate developments as necessary and to enhance the effectiveness of public health interaction with schools during the pandemic.  I can also confirm that the public health response to schools has been further enhanced by the HSE through the increased resourcing of the existing dedicated School Teams in each HSE area to assist schools\/settings where a positive case of COVID-19 is identified. These teams are being led by public health professionals augmented by staff from the Department of Education who will be reassigned to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  To support the provision of a safe environment in schools, my Department secured very significant funding of over &euro;375 million. This has enabled schools to put in place enhanced cleaning and hygiene arrangements, modify buildings and rooms to facilitate physical distancing, hire extra and replacement teachers and purchase PPE through a procurement framework.   My Department continues to work with schools in this respect.  The funding has been put in place to support schools in implementing their COVID-19 response plans, which have been informed by public health expert advice from the HPSC.  In instances where a school class or year group has to isolate for 14 days due to Covid-19, my Department is working with stakeholders to ensure that continuity of teaching and learning takes place.  This includes advising schools to provide access to school owned devices for students or teachers where this is a barrier.  ICT funding of &euro;50m was provided to schools earlier this year and schools were advised to use this funding to purchase additional devices if required. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to high risk staff, an enhanced occupational healthcare service has been put in place. Very High Risk staff are permitted to work from home and other staff in the normal and higher risk categories can return to the workplace provided appropriate risk mitigation are in place and implemented according to their School COVID-19 Response plan.  This is in line with the approach being adopted in other areas of the public sector including the health sector.  A review process has been put in place where concerns remain.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the ASTI directives to members during the current COVID-19 emergency situation, employees may be asked and may go beyond normal working arrangements to facilitate the continuation of delivery of educational services. In relation to terms of employment measures implemented on a temporary basis during this emergency period. My Department has confirmed to the unions that such measures will not be implemented on a permanent basis without the normal discussion process taking place through the usual industrial relations mechanisms. It is accepted that such temporary measures are being operated by staff on a without prejudice basis and will not be used in any way by my Department as a precedent in any subsequent industrial relations discussions.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with all education partners, including ASTI, in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000081#WRW07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000081#WRW07200"},{"type":"question","counter":1224,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[35482\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000081#WRW07300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of full-time equivalent and part-time equivalent roles filled by her Department of posts at principal officer, assistant principal officer, higher executive officer, executive officer and clerical officer grades for the past five years; the cost to the Exchequer; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1225,"content":"<p>The information requested by the deputy on roles filled by my department in the past five years is below.

This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.<\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  <\/p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type. Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children<\/p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides a support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  The Department may make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000082#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":1235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000082#WRX01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1236,"qnumday":491,"qnumall":"[34876\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000082#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to remedy the difference between the level of the pandemic unemployment payment and the return-to-education allowance and VTOS training allowance in order to encourage and incentivise those out of work to retrain or reskill.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1237,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[34875\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000082#WRX01300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason for the disparity between the level of the pandemic unemployment payment and the return-to-education allowance and VTOS training allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1238,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[34878\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000082#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason new first year students at third level cannot claim the pandemic unemployment while other full-time students are entitled to; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1239,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 491, 508 and 509 together.<\/p>  <p>On 5 August the Social Welfare (Covid-19)(Amendment) Act 2019 introduced the Pandemic Unemployment Payment Scheme as a statutory scheme.

It is available to employees who lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 as a direct consequence of Covid-19. It is also available to self-employed people whose income from self-employment ceased or reduced as a direct consequence of the pandemic to the extent that they would be available to take up full-time employment. <\/p>  <p>   It is a long-standing feature of social welfare legislation that individuals who are engaged in employment or self-employment are liable to pay PRSI on those activities. In those circumstances, persons claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment should have no difficulty satisfying these conditions.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of employees, the Department uses earnings data supplied by the Revenue Commissioners for 2019 and 2020 in the case of employees, and 2018 and 2019 in the case of self-employed people. Data is updated as often as practicable, and in the case of employees on a daily basis. For self-employed individuals, my Department has recently received an update from the Revenue Commissioners on 2019 self-assessment returns. However, as returns are filed on an annual basis and the deadline for filing these returns is 10 December 2020, some returns will still be outstanding. <\/p>  <p>  Where the Department cannot find any record of contributions or earnings in the reference period, it contacts the people concerned and asks them to submit evidence of employment in the form of recent payslips etc. It is important to stress that claims are not refused. The individuals concerned are advised that their claims cannot be processed, based on the information to hand, and they are asked to supply any information which they have to resolve the matter.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s experience is that some people do not provide any evidence but allow their claim to lapse &ndash; this in itself highlights why it is important to have some level of checks in place.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the numbers concerned are relatively low. This week, for example, just under 343,000 claims were paid,  while just over 4,800 (just over 1%) were held where the Department  could not validate entitlement using Revenue records or where the information provided by the applicant was incomplete or where it is clear that the applicant does not meet the eligibility criteria. My Department has contacted the people concerned and asked them to submit evidence of employment or other information required.  <\/p>  <p>  In total, just under 10,000 cases where my Department could not validate entitlement using Revenue record were resolved over the last two weeks by a combination of officer review and enhanced system checks. Of these, 288 were found to require formal disallowance.

The supports available include: <\/p>  <p>  Intreo Service<\/p>  <p>  The Intreo service is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports in the State.  Intreo provides tailored employment services and supports to both jobseekers and employers.  Jobseekers, including jobseekers with disabilities, who seek support from their local Intreo Centre, work with a case officer with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.<\/p>  <p>  Local Employment Service<\/p>  <p>  The Department contracts for the provision of Local Employment Services with 22 companies in 26 locations.  Providers deliver a case managed employment service for all Jobseekers (including those with disabilities) who avail of the services. Jobseekers work with a LES Mediator to develop a personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.  LES Mediators may refer clients of the service to an EmployAbility service provider, if it is felt the person would benefit from this more specialised service.<\/p>  <p>  Employability Services<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises the additional difficulties some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment in the open labour market, and so contracts for the provision of services to help address these difficulties. The Department contracts with 24 companies for the delivery of EmployAbility services in 31 locations.  Jobseekers are referred to EmployAbility providers by Intreo Centres (or by other contractors as designated, e.g. LES providers).  Providers deliver a supported employment model of services for jobseekers with disabilities.  Jobseekers work with a job Coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also funds a number of other related programmes\/services:<\/p>  <p>  - The 'Ability' programme, introduced in June 2018 which is a pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities.  Over a three year period, the programme will support over 2,600 young people with disabilities aged between 15 and 29 years of age. The 27 projects funded have been designed to assist young people in their transition from school and other settings into further education and employment. This will be undertaken using person-centred, case management approaches that support participants to achieve their desired employment goals. Funding for this programme is being provided jointly (on a 50:50 basis) under the EU's ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) Operational Programme, 2014-2020 and the Irish Exchequer.  Funding has also been provided for an evaluation of the programme to be undertaken, to capture the learnings as an aid to any future programme design.<\/p>  <p>  - The 'Willing Able Mentoring' (WAM) programme, which is a work placement programme that aims to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities. The programme provides graduates with disabilities with the opportunity to undertake a minimum 6 month, paid, mentored work placement with employers.<\/p>  <p>  - Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) which provides a range of employment support grants for people with disabilities and their employers. The fund is comprised of the Employee Retention Grant, Workplace Equipment\/Adaptation Grant, Personal Reader Grant and Job Interview Interpreter Grant.<\/p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) provides three levels of financial incentives that may be claimed by private sector employers in respect of their employees.  The objective of these incentives is to encourage private sector employers to employ people with disabilities and thereby increase the numbers of people with disabilities employed in the open labour market.  The WSS provides financial support directly related to the individual employees with a disability being employed, and also the costs associated with any additional administrative or supervisory expenditure incurred with such employment.  The guidelines state that, for an employment to qualify for a WSS subsidy, an employee must not be in receipt of Illness Benefit, Invalidity Pension or Partial Capacity Benefit. This is to avoid a position where there are dual supports being availed of in respect to a single employment. <\/p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of invalidity pension or in receipt of illness benefit for greater than 6 months who wish to return to work can apply for Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB).  The PCB scheme is designed for people who are on Illness Benefit, for at least six months, or on Invalidity pension and who have retained some capacity for work and wish to work.  If awarded, PCB will allow a person to continue to receive, in addition to their earnings from employment, a percentage of their Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment while working.  <\/p>  <p>  The personal rate of payment of PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person's restriction, regarding their capacity for work, whether the person was in receipt of Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension and their current rate of payment. After the medical assessment, if a person's disability is rated as moderate, severe or profound their previous payment continues at 50, 75 or 100 per cent, respectively. There is no limit on the number of hours a person awarded PCB may work. <\/p>  <p>  Both the WSS and PCB seek to improve employment outcomes for persons with disabilities.

In this regard, it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Pensions Commission and I will introduce legislation later this year to give effect to this.  <\/p><p>I am keenly aware of the gender issues related to pensions.  In this regard, the Pensions Council, a statutory body set up to advise my office on matters related to pensions, funded a research programme with the ESRI on gender and pensions.  While this research, published last year, found a 35% gender gap in overall pension payments in Ireland, there was no evidence of any gap stemming from the State pension system - the gap arises in occupational and personal pensions.  <\/p><p>In this regard, the Government committed in the Programme for Government to introduce an automatic enrolment retirement saving system for workers, with the freedom of choice to opt-out.  This will work to increase the low levels of supplementary pension coverage for workers in the private sector, an issue that particularly impacts women.<\/p><p>The introduction of the interim Total Contributions Approach to calculating the rate of the State Pension Contributory (SPC) has also had a significant impact on increasing the rate of payment for women. In particular, the introduction of HomeCaring periods recognises the impact that time out of labour force for caring purposes can have on the rate of pension payable.  Unlike the Homemaker's scheme, HomeCaring periods can apply to periods before 1994.  This approach has resulted in a significant increase in the pension payment rates for women, as women predominantly take on caring responsibilities.  <\/p><p>In this regard, at end-January 2019, prior to the implementation of an interim 'Total Contributions Approach (TCA)', 37.4% of all women in receipt of SPC received payment at the maximum rate.  Since the introduction of the interim TCA arrangements, by end September 2020, 48.1% of all women in receipt of SPC received the maximum rate.  This is a significant improvement over a relatively short time period.<\/p><p>The Commission's Terms of Reference includes the examination of sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund. More broadly, it will also consider the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and consider how the pension system can further accommodate carers. <\/p><p>The membership of the Commission, approved by Government, reflects the need to have subject matter experts to deal with the complex social and public policy issues arising in pensions, as well as stakeholder representation which will keep the work of the Commission grounded. This includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise. It will be chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily.  More details, including the Terms of Reference and membership details, are available on the Department's website at: .<\/p><p>The Commission has strong female representation in its membership and I am pleased that the majority of confirmed members - 5 out of 9 - are women.  I am fully confident that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, has the necessary perspective and expertise to consider the potential impacts of pensions reform options on relevant affected groups, such as women, workers, and older people.  <\/p><p>The Commission will also engage with a range of key stakeholders to ensure that it has a genuine understanding of not only the fiscal sustainability challenges involved, but the social sustainability challenges of implementing potential policy reforms. The exact mechanisms for this engagement will be shaped by the Chair and by Commission members.<\/p><p>As you will be aware, while this Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State's finances, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.

For the 2020\/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit\/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.<\/p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. <\/p>  <p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000085#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":1450,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000085#WRAA02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[34617\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000085#WRAA02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the interaction he has had with UCD over the 2% to 4% increase in fees for EU and non-EU students studying graduate entry medicine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1452,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[34635\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000085#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will address matters raised in correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1453,"qnumday":575,"qnumall":"[34947\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000085#WRAA02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a campaign by students applying for the graduate entry medicine course in UCD in relation to the increasing fees for this particular course of study; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1454,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 567, 571 and 575 together.<\/p>  <p>Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants.

The Group held its first meeting in September and has been tasked with agreeing a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system having regard to international best practice, in parallel with the establishment of the dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. <\/p>  <p>  A work plan is currently being developed by the group and I understand that one of the tasks to be undertaken is consideration of the various recommendations contained in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality Report on Reform of the Family Law System. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a less adversarial resolution of disputes. <\/p>  <p>  In September, the Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill to provide for the establishment of a District Family Court, a Circuit Family Court and a Family High Court as divisions within the existing court structures.  <\/p>  <p>  In the preparation of the General Scheme, account has been taken of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on the Reform of the Family Law System, published in October 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The publication of the General Scheme is a first step in an ongoing process of improving how people are able to resolve family-based problems that require a legal solution.

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of our protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security. For those found not to be in need of protection, we can offer them assistance to return to their home country. This objective of timely decision-making is shared by the Expert Group led by Dr. Catherine Day, whose Report Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and I published very recently. <\/p>  <p>  During the early stages of the pandemic, it was decided to issue only positive recommendations from the International Protection Office. This was to ensure that applicants with negative recommendations were not disadvantaged by the time limits set out in the legislation within which to make an appeal or to request a review of a refusal of permission to remain. As substantive processing and appeal hearings recommenced in more recent months, so too did the issuing of negative decisions. While the number of negative decisions has not increased, there has been a build-up in the issuing of such decisions, with a higher volume than normal issuing in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The letter referred to by the Deputy is sent to inform the relevant person of their negative international protection decision and to also inform them that they no longer have permission to remain in the State. They are required to confirm within five days if they will accept the option of voluntary return, for which my Department will provide assistance. If they do not confirm that they will leave voluntarily, a deportation order will be made against them. <\/p>  <p>  The five day timeline is set down in primary legislation so must be adhered to in official correspondence. However, I understand a pragmatic approach is taken and, to be clear, the person is not required to remove themselves from the State within five days &ndash; they are required to indicate an intention to do so. Obviously, the time taken for voluntary return arrangements to be made will take into account all factors, including Covid-19 based restrictions and the limitations to travel this has created. That said, I do accept that particular issues arise with Level 5 restrictions.

I am informed that over 8,200 contacts or attempts to contact victims of domestic abuse were recorded by Garda&iacute; as part of that work (between 1 January 2020 and 25 May 2020).

I am further informed that Phase III commenced 28th October 2020 and will continue to reach out and make contact with victims to provide reassurance, support and to offer the assistance of local and specialised resources and is committed to arresting and bringing before the courts those offenders who have breached domestic violence legislation and in particular Court Orders obtained under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act, 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; also continue to develop their specialist services in this area and I am pleased that Divisional Protective Services Units have now been rolled out nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that as part of the overall response to address domestic abuse during the Covid 19 pandemic, my Department at the outset developed an inter-agency plan and is now leading efforts to identify lessons which can be learned from this plan to ensure our approach to address these issues remains up-to-date and as effective as possible.

I understand that a copy of the report was also sent to the family concerned. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed, however, that there is ongoing correspondence in relation to the matters raised in the report and that it is GSOC's intention to address the question of publication of an anonymised version of the report once these matters are clarified. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry","counter":1599,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1600,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[34950\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the implementation of the recommendations of the 2013 Smithwick Report.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1601,"content":"<p>The Smithwick Tribunal made thematic recommendations regarding North-South police co-operation, Garda discipline and the investigation of historic crimes with a cross-border element.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly it should be stated from the outset that there is close and ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of all aspects of policing. There is continuous cooperation between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their counterparts in the PSNI. In addition there are a number of structured and targeted co-operation mechanisms, as follows: <\/p>  <p>  The Cross Border Policing Strategy aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, and to disrupt criminal activity and enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island of Ireland. The Strategy was renewed in 2015 and covers an extensive range of policing activities.<\/p>  <p>  The annual Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime further enhances cooperation between law enforcement agencies. Its aim is to enhance understanding and cooperation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, particularly in relation to cross border organised criminality and related issues. <\/p>  <p>  In November 2015, the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the Fresh Start agreement as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force. The Task Force is led by senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and UK (HM) Revenue and Customs. A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also involved in operational activity where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  There has been very considerable operational activity, with a variety of different operations undertaken since the establishment of the Task Force. The Task Force has had a number of significant successes in countering organised criminality on both sides of the border.<\/p>  <p>  This close cooperation was further developed in November 2019, when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI established a Joint Investigation Team to address the attacks on Quinn Industrial Holdings and its management.  This was the first ever Joint Investigation Team established involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is a significant step forward in cross border police cooperation and had been in preparation for some time.<\/p>  <p>  This close cooperation has also been enhanced, as recommended by Judge Smithwick, via a number of personnel exchanges between the two police forces. Such exchanges are provided for in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Police Co-operation.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the recommendation to review vetting procedures, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a review of internal vetting procedures and an Internal Garda Vetting Unit will be established under the remit of the Garda Anti-Corruption Unit on the completion of this review, structured in accordance with international best practice.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the recommendation where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carries on business activities in his or her own time, the current Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 2007, provide for the Garda Commissioner to prohibit certain spare time activities for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is developing policy and guidelines relating to the holding of business and secondary interests by the Garda workforce.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to investigations, Commissions or Tribunals of Inquiry in relation to a historic crime with a cross&ndash;border element, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 as amended provides that assistance in relation criminal investigations or proceedings may be sought by one state from another, including cross-border investigations. The Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 2019 provides that Coroners in Northern Ireland and Britain dealing with legacy cases can access testimony from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where this is relevant to their inquests. It will also provide a structured mechanism to enhance co-operation with a number of bodies dealing with deaths related to the troubles, including the Historical Investigations Unit to be established in Northern Ireland and the Ireland-UK Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, both of which arise from the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems","counter":1602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1603,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[34962\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda CCTV cameras located in each location in tabular form; if all cameras are currently working in full order; and if all Garda CCTV cameras are monitored on a 24\/7 basis.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1604,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>I have requested information from the Garda Commissioner in relation to this matter but it was unfortunately not possible to compile it in the time available. <\/p><p>I will write to the Deputy directly with the information requested, when it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1605,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1606,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[34963\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000087#WRCC02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the Garda stations she has visited as Minister since 1 August 2020; and the date and purpose of each visit to each station in tabular form.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1607,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate, as Minister for Justice, it is often incumbent upon me to visit Garda stations and facilities around the country.

Significant developments may include the following:  inter-prison transfers; Parole Board hearings and decisions arising out of this process; temporary releases and expected release dates. Where victims make their views known to the Irish Prison Service, they are always taken into account when making sentence management decisions, such as granting temporary release.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Irish Prison Service does not receive information on the victim of a particular crime when a prisoner is committed to custody by the Courts. The Victim Liaison Service is a voluntary service and victims may register with the Service if they wish to be advised of the significant developments in a prisoner&rsquo;s sentence as outlined above.

This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation . The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. <\/p>  <p>  At Level 5, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public.<\/p>  <p>  The list of essential services that can remain open during Level 5 includes therapy services provided by a member of a designated profession within the meaning of section 3 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (No. 27 of 2005).

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. <\/p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  <\/p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges. <\/p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. By 11 November, when the fourth round of deliveries will be completed, 1.3 million doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  The quantities distributed to individual GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. <\/p>  <p>  Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.

In line with the Government decision of May 2020, this readiness work has been intensified on the basis of two scenarios: (i) a limited Free Trade Agreement (FTA), or, (ii) a hard Brexit with the EU and UK trading on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. <\/p><p>The Department, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), together with the full support of stakeholders in the medicine supply chain, are implementing a comprehensive and coordinated set of preparations to ensure continuity of health services and continued supply of medicines in the event of a no deal, hard Brexit. <\/p><p>Section 2.5 of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published in September 2020, outlines work which has been undertaken in relation to the supply of medicines and medical devices.<\/p><p><i>www.dfa.ie\/media\/dfa\/eu\/brexit\/keydocuments\/Brexit-Readiness-Action-Plan.pdf<\/i>.<\/p><p>The Department, the HSE, and the HPRA have facilitated ongoing engagements with manufacturers and suppliers of medicines, to ensure that they are ready for the end of the transition period, to discuss any potential issues that could affect supply to Ireland, including the impact that Covid-19 has had on supply chains, and to identify solutions to maintain supply to the Irish market. <\/p><p>Ireland is unlikely to face general medicine shortages in the period immediately after the end of the transition period. Any emerging supply issues, due to disruption at ports for example, will, in the first instance, be dealt with from existing supplies held within the domestic supply chain. There are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain, which is different to medicine wholesaling models elsewhere.<\/p><p>Through collaborative engagement with medicines manufacturers and wholesalers, they have assured us that they are confident that they will have sufficient stocks to bridge any initial issues at ports, should they occur. <\/p><p>Therefore, there is no need for pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions, as doing so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients. Patients should continue to fill their prescriptions and take their medications as they normally would. <\/p><p>Significant work has been undertaken to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and risks and to provide a high level of assurance around continuity of care and treatment for patients in Ireland. Work on this will continue, including ongoing monitoring of supplies in Ireland and engagement with industry to adapt supply chains, where necessary, to minimise any potential disruption, up to the end of the transition period and in the weeks and months beyond.<\/p><p>However, medicines shortages inevitably arise from time to time and are a feature of modern health systems around the world. The potential future shortage of any specific medicine will be managed through the existing multi-stakeholder, national Medicine Shortages Framework to prevent the shortage from occurring where possible or, where it does occur, to manage the impact in terms of identifying alternative treatments. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit. Importantly though, any shortages currently affecting the Irish market are not directly attributable to Brexit. <\/p><p>If a patient has any concerns about their medicine, they are encouraged to speak with their pharmacist or GP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000089#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":1714,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000089#WREE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1715,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[34601\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000089#WREE01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has conducted research on whether carbon emissions related to the healthcare sector will be measured and presented annually.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1716,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000089#WREE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1717,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000089#WREE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1718,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[34602\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000089#WREE01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if businesses providing elective aesthetic treatments under certain circumstances (details supplied) fall under essential services with respect of the level 5 Covid-19 restrictions.","asker":"1460","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1719,"content":"<p>The Government's medium-term strategy <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-1<\/i>9, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.<\/p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time.

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. <\/p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV), made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  <\/p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges. <\/p>  <p>  Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer have not been as quick as we would have liked due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. Vaccines are distributed in two-week cycles. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have already been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019\/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists have been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses are being distributed for use. <\/p>  <p>  Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact.  <\/p>  <p>  The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country. A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza, helping to protect others in the community.

COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.<\/p>  <p>   The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete.

Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.<\/p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19.

The majority of the HSE&rsquo;s Memory Technology Resource Rooms are now providing telephone\/video assessment and consultation.  Primary care team support is operating nationwide, with referrals made to community supports including the Dementia Adviser Service and local authority community response forums. While home support visits have been somewhat restricted, the HSE applies prioritisation and screening measures to identify clients in need of home visits.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland continues to support people with dementia and their families.  While day care and respite services are suspended, their National Helpline, Dementia Advisers, Online Family Carer Training and Home Care are all still running.  ASI have also introduced new online services and supports &ndash; Online Support Groups for Family Carers, Virtual Alzheimer Caf&eacute;s and Alternative Activity Therapy.  Their National Helpline is expanding with a new free call-back service which offers people with dementia and family carers the opportunity to book a 1:1 session with a Dementia Nurse or Adviser.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance for re-opening day centres including those for people with dementia has issued to CHOs.  CHOs are requested to undertake risk assessments in centres to determine if infection prevention and control measures can be implemented to ensure social distancing and the safe transport of clients to and from centres.  Advice from NPHET is that people over 70, as medically vulnerable people, should continue to cocoon and not gather in congregated settings. The HSE is committed to reopening its day services but needs to resolve these issues. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2021 the Government has allocated an additional &euro;12.9 million for Dementia services with a particular focus on extending the availability of community-focused supports. The additional investment will provide dedicated access to at least 250,000 additional home care hours. It will improve diagnostic services through the establishment of Memory Assessment and Support Services in Mayo, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford, and a specialist memory clinic in Cork.

The HSE has adapted its community services in order to provide a flexible response.  The majority of the HSE&rsquo;s Memory Technology Resource Rooms are now providing telephone\/video assessment and consultation.  Primary care team support is operating nationwide, with referrals made to community supports including the Dementia Adviser Service and local authority community response forums. While home support visits have been somewhat restricted, the HSE applies prioritisation and screening measures to identify clients in need of home visits.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland continues to support people with dementia and their families.  While day care and respite services are suspended, their National Helpline, Dementia Advisers, Online Family Carer Training and Home Care are all still running.  ASI have also introduced new online services and supports &ndash; Online Support Groups for Family Carers, Virtual Alzheimer Caf&eacute;s and Alternative Activity Therapy.  Their National Helpline is expanding with a new free call-back service which offers people with dementia and family carers the opportunity to book a 1:1 session with a Dementia Nurse or Adviser.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance for re-opening day centres including those for people with dementia has issued to CHOs.  CHOs are requested to undertake risk assessments in centres to determine if infection prevention and control measures can be implemented to ensure social distancing and the safe transport of clients to and from centres.  Advice from NPHET is that people over 70, as medically vulnerable people, should continue to cocoon and not gather in congregated settings. The HSE is committed to reopening its day services but needs to resolve these issues. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2021 the Government has allocated an additional &euro;12.9 million for Dementia services with a particular focus on extending the availability of community-focused supports. The additional investment will provide dedicated access to at least 250,000 additional home care hours. It will improve diagnostic services through the establishment of Memory Assessment and Support Services in Mayo, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford, and a specialist memory clinic in Cork. It will also be used to increase access to in-home day care, further develop the Dementia: Understand Together initiative, provide more dementia advisers, improve the national network of memory technology resource rooms, help deliver an acute hospital dementia and delirium care pathway, and implement the national clinical guideline on the appropriate use of psychotropic medication in people with dementia.

An important element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree with the private hospitals a new arrangement which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases and separately with ongoing agreed access, in conjunction with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to private hospital services to address the HSE's priority needs in providing both urgent time-critical care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays. <\/p>  <p>  In August the HSE initiated a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address anticipated shortfalls over the next two years. The process is due to be completed soon, and a panel put in place, following which each hospital will run mini competitions for the services they need.

The LAVS also perform a range of other functions and services with\/for other Government Departments.  The annual funding provided by the Department of Health to the FSAI is inclusive of funding for the Local Authority service contracts and while funded by the Department, the FSAI is independent in the exercise of its functions.<\/p>  <p>  The FSAI and the County &amp;amp; City Management Association (CCMA), on behalf of the Local Authorities, have been engaging for some time regarding the funding and effective delivery of the FSAI service contract.  The current LA service contracts with the FSAI are due to expire on 30 November 2020.  Both parties have agreed to work together to introduce a new, more efficient model of service. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the need for a more efficient model of service, additional funding is being made available by my Department to the FSAI, on a once-off basis, in respect of the LAVS service contracts for 2021.  This is in recognition of the need to provide more stability to the food business sector that might be impacted. The additional funding is subject to a number of conditions relating to the development of a new model of service delivery and related service matters.<\/p>  <p>  On 28 October 2020, the CCMA agreed to the FSAI&rsquo;s offer of additional funding and the associated conditions.  The FSAI is sending contracts to the Local Authorities with a view to having them in place by 1 December 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the FSAI and CCMA will work constructively together to ensure that a new service contract model is developed in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000092#WRHH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":1939,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000092#WRHH02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1940,"qnumday":743,"qnumall":"[35239\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000092#WRHH02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of medical card patients and entitlement of general practitioners to charge them for consultations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1941,"content":"<p>The majority of GPs hold a GMS contract with the HSE for the provision of medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.

For example, for 2020, 62 out of 78 TACs discussed at December Council 2019 were set at or below the level of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). This is compared to only 5 stocks in 2009. This is clear evidence of progress through the CFP and the shared aim of sustainable fishing.<\/p>  <p>  The report implies that Ireland deliberately sought to have TACs set in excess of the scientific advice and attempted to ignore or downplay the specific circumstances of each stock. These findings do not reflect the complexity of fisheries management and the TAC-setting mechanisms and the relationship to scientific advice.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s goals for sustainable fisheries are supported through the Common Fisheries Policy. The CFP provides the framework for the long-term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission makes proposals each year for TAC levels for each stock - these are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks. It also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice. The TAC&rsquo;s are adopted by the EU Council which involves all Member States and the Commission &ndash; not just Ireland. The vast majority of stocks in which Ireland has an interest are shared with other Member States and each has their own views and concerns.<\/p>  <p>  At last year&rsquo;s December Council, TACs and quotas were agreed for 47 stocks of interest to Ireland. For 32 target stocks, the TACs for 2020 were set at or below the scientific advice where available, meeting MSY criteria. For 4 vulnerable stocks of interest to Ireland, where the advice was for no fishing, restrictive TACs and quotas were set. This allows for unavoidable by-catches of these stocks, in circumstances where they are part of mixed fisheries. The Council also agreed to very small TACs and quotas to allow for the collection of scientific data for 3 depleted herring stocks. For the 8 remaining stocks, it was agreed to set precautionary quotas considering the scientific advice available, and the status of many of these as minor by-catches. <\/p>  <p>  Last week, I launched a public consultation on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for 2021 fishing opportunities and the scientific advice for stocks as part of my Sustainability Impact Assessment.  Each year, in order to inform Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the December Fisheries Council, an assessment of the potential impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken.  To facilitate the assessment, an open consultation process is carried out, whereby stakeholders may submit comments and observations.  I plan also to meet with stakeholders, including environmental NGO&rsquo;s, in advance of the December Council.  The Sustainability Impact Assessment, which is informed by the scientific and technical experts of the Marine Institute and BIM and the views received from stakeholders, will be presented to the Oireachtas and I will discuss the issues and concerns with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture Food and the Marine in advance of the negotiations on TACs and quota setting for 2021.

This means that, despite the undoubted disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 81.9% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts involved.<\/p><p>A comparison of sale sheets returns from livestock sales that took place between October 26<sup>th<\/sup>&ndash; October 30<sup>th<\/sup>with those returned in the week preceding lockdown  shows that there is very little variation in price for comparative grades of animals.

The overall price difference where evident is very small and this may be down to seasonal factors impacted on by the presentation of animals after recent harsh weather conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000094#WRKK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme","counter":2066,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000094#WRKK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2067,"qnumday":789,"qnumall":"[34552\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000094#WRKK01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to change the basic payment scheme, BPS, under which some young trained farmers receive very low payments based on a situation that pertained approximately 20 years ago in terms of historic stocking density; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2068,"content":"<p>The Basic Payment Scheme came into effect in 2015 and established payment entitlement values under the scheme from that date.

At their request, a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme was introduced for fishing vessels in the Polyvalent, Beam Trawl and Specific segments of the fleet. <\/p><p>The Scheme operated over three months June to August inclusive, and allowed vessel owners to voluntarily opt to tie up for a maximum of two months each.  The Scheme was intended as a safety net scheme to assist fishermen who did not consider fishing to be economically viable during a temporary period of market disturbance and weak prices.  The Scheme supported the fixed costs incurred by the vessel owners and as such was designed to complement the Covid-19 wage supports and loan arrangements already being provided by Government to the fishing sector and indeed other sectors of our economy.  The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme were based on official data derived from fishing vessel owners as part of the EU Data Collection Framework.  Support payments ranged from &euro;500 per month for the very smallest vessels under 8 metres up to &euro;6,000 for the largest over 24 metres.<\/p><p>While the European Maritime Fisheries Fund (EMFF) regulation was amended to facilitate Covid-19 mitigation measure, no additional funding was provided by the EU to implement such measures. The Scheme was funded under my Department's EMFF Programme 2014-20 which is nearing its end, with its funds almost entirely committed.  As a demand-led scheme, and with a rapidly changing market situation in Europe, likely take-up of the Scheme and cost could not be forecast in advance.  Likewise, the number of eligible vessels could not be identified in advance as there were particular eligibility requirements to be met and data was not available on which vessel owners might satisfy those requirements.  <\/p><p>A maximum budget of approximately &euro;1.7 million was re-allocated from other support schemes to facilitate the Tie-up scheme.  Ultimately, some 98 grant offers were accepted by fishing vessel owners involving 147 one-month tie-up periods and at a cost of &euro;218,000.  The unused funds are being re-allocated back for other support measures.  This may potentially allow BIM to re-open the scheme of capital grants for investment on board, which were suspended by BIM earlier this year, though this is subject to an evaluation of the overall commitment situation for the Programme.<\/p><p>The table below provides a breakdown of the 147 tie-up periods aided. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Category <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>June <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>July <\/div><\/th>       <th><div> August<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>&amp;lt;6m<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>10<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>10<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>6     &amp;lt; 8m<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>11<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>17<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>7<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>8   &amp;lt; 10m<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>20<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>16<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>5<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>10   &amp;lt; 12m<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>11<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>3<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>12     &amp;lt; 15m<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>7<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>4<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>15     &amp;lt; 18m<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>0<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>18     &amp;lt; 24m<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>6<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>7<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>2<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>&amp;gt;     24m<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>2<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>3<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000095#WRLL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":2158,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000095#WRLL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2159,"qnumday":821,"qnumall":"[35197\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000095#WRLL03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the applications by organisations (details supplied) to become producer organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2160,"content":"<p>Article 14 of Regulation 1379\/2013 on the Common Organisation of the Market for Fishery and Aquaculture Products (CMO) specifies EU regulatory requirements for recognition of fisheries and aquaculture producer organisations.

A farm is defined as viable if family labour is remunerated at greater than or equal to the minimum wage and there is sufficient income to provide an additional five per cent return on non-land based assets employed on the farm. Over the past decade or more the results indicate that approximately one third of farms are viable, one third sustainable due to the presence of an off-farm income source, and about one third are vulnerable. The percentage of farms in each category varies only slightly over the years, depending on the economics of farming in that particular year.<\/p>  <p>  There is a strong correlation between viability and system of farming, whether full-time or part-time. Based on the number of hours work required, about one third of farms are considered full-time farms by Teagasc. Almost 90% of dairy farms are considered full-time, while around 17% of cattle and sheep farms are considered full-time. Full-time farms are often the larger farms with average utilisable agricultural area (U.A.A) of 69.8 hectares compared to 30.4 hectares for part-time farms.<\/p>  <p>  The viability of farms also varies considerably by farm type with 75% of Dairy farms and 63% of Tillage farms classified as viable, while 27% of Sheep farms, 24% of Cattle Other farms and 13% of Cattle Rearing farms were considered viable in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Over 52% of farm households had a source of off-farm employment income in 2019 while 30% of farm households were in receipt of a pension. The higher age profile of Cattle and Sheep farmers compared to Dairy farmers is reflected here with 35.2% of Sheep farm households in receipt of a pension, 35.7% of Cattle Other farms and 31.5% of Cattle Rearing farms compared to just 15.4% on Dairy farms.<\/p>  <p>  The NFS examined the level of support provided by the exchequer and EU through farm payments. The average Cattle Other farm received &euro;496 per hectare in 2019, up 13% compared to 2018 and up 23% compared to 2015, when they received an average of &euro;404 per hectare. Cattle Rearing farms received an average of &euro;461 per hectare, up 23% on 2015, while Sheep farms received an average payment per hectare of &euro;411 per hectare, up from &euro;348 in 2015 or 18%.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture is a key economic and social driver underpinning the vitality of rural villages and towns across the country. A new agri-food strategy to 2030 is currently being considered by a Committee of sector stakeholders.

This Act strengthens the legislative basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability.

RC&Eacute; tendered for the establishment of a traceability system for racing greyhounds in early 2020. It is expected that the traceability system will be delivered to RC&Eacute; during Quarter 4 in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  - Incentivising rehoming of greyhounds in Ireland through additional supports through the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, (established and operated by RC&Eacute;).<\/p>  <p>  - The establishment of a separate &ldquo;Greyhound Care Fund&rdquo; and the opening of Care Centres for retired greyhounds while they await rehomimg.<\/p>  <p>  The welfare of greyhounds remains a priority for RC&Eacute; and was a key consideration during the suspension of racing activity.

My Department is also assured that all necessary resources are being committed to these ends. All reported incidents of greyhound cruelty and neglect are investigated, and where breaches of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 are identified, appropriate action is taken. <\/p>  <p>  Regular bilateral meetings are held at a senior level to discuss matters relating to governance, including policies, performance and funding of RC&Eacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000095#WRLL06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":2189,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000095#WRLL06900"},{"type":"question","counter":2190,"qnumday":832,"qnumall":"[35479\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000095#WRLL07000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of full-time equivalent and part-time equivalent roles filled by his Department of posts at principal officer, assistant principal officer, higher executive officer, executive officer and clerical officer grades for the past five years; the cost to the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2191,"content":"<p>My Department uses workforce planning processes to identify and address critical resource needs required to deliver its business goals.

Therefore, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The details of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalised and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000096#WRMM05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"CL&Aacute;R Programme","counter":2243,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000096#WRMM05700"},{"type":"question","counter":2244,"qnumday":853,"qnumall":"[35449\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111000096#WRMM05800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the further rounds of CL&Aacute;R funding that are yet to be announced; and when she will be in a position to announce same.","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2245,"content":"<p>The 2020 CL&Aacute;R programme was launched in May 2020 with applications invited under three separate Measures:<\/p><p>Measure1: Support for Schools\/Community Safety Measures<\/p><p>Measure 2: Community Recreation Areas (new for 2020)<\/p><p>Measure 3: Community Wellbeing Support<\/p><p>(a) Meals on Wheels and linked services (new in 2020)<\/p><p>(b) Mobility and Cancer Care Transport,<\/p><p>I announced the successful projects under Measures 1 and 2 of the programme on 2<sup>nd<\/sup>November. <\/p><p>&euro;4.1 million has been allocated to 115 projects under these Measures.
