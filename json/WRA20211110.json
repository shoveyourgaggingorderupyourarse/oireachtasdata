The IPCC&rsquo;s Fifth Assessment Report confirms that, although methane has a short lifespan in our atmosphere at 12.4 years, it has a GWP of 28, meaning that it is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a century, or 84 times more potent over two decades. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to agricultural methane emissions, the scientific advice of the IPCC in their 2018 report, is that it is not necessary for biogenic methane emissions to reach net-zero to meet the Paris Agreement target, nor would this be an attainable goal. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless is it clear that methane reductions must be made, and also it is important to note that other harmful pollutants are also produced through agricultural activities, including nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) which contribute to reduced water, air, and soil quality. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000073#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000073#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[55090\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000073#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will provide information on the measurable progress Ireland has made on the list of actions Ireland agreed to in the Paris Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>Climate change remains a trans-boundary challenge that can only be addressed through committed ambition and effective multilateral cooperation at the international level.

The full suite of measures to maintain workplace safety should be considered by employers before making any assessment as to whether knowledge of vaccination status is necessary. COVID-19 vaccination in general would not be considered a necessary workplace safety measure for many workplaces or roles. However, there may be specific employment contexts where knowledge of vaccination status may be deemed necessary, subject to a risk assessment and with reference to sector-specific public health guidance. Employers are required to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis. As a result, the data requested by the Deputy is not available centrally from my department. <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist civil and public service organisations with their work-related obligations during COVID-19, the Civil Service HR Policy Division within my Department regularly issues Guidance and FAQs for Public Service Employers during Covid-19, which can be found here: www.gov.ie\/en\/news\/092fff-update-on-working-arrangements-and-leave-associated-with-covid-19-fo\/. This document is regularly updated to reflect any changes in public health guidance and government policy. Section 1.1 of this document, which is based on public health advice and the Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021, provides guidance for employers in relation to who should attend the work premise during the pandemic. In line with public health advice, a cautious and careful return to workplaces should take into account appropriate attendance levels, with the use of staggered arrangements such as non-fulltime attendance and flexible working hours. Additionally the advice is that all existing infection prevention and control measures, (such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, face coverings, adequate ventilation), and working from home unless an employee&rsquo;s physical presence in the workplace is for specific business purposes, must also remain in place for individuals even following their vaccination. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000074#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":104,"content":"<p>Question No. 80 answered with Question No. 79.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[54866\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000074#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has issued advice to other Departments and or Ministers regarding the phased return of civil servants to the Department office environment; and if he has made provision for the non-return of those who are clinically vulnerable and-or compromised in the context of Covid-19.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[54865\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000074#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide the advice he has issued to Departments in respect of the return to work of civil servants in their respective offices; if he has made provision for those who are clinically vulnerable and-or compromised regarding contracting Covid 19; if he has provided for civil servants who require medical consultations in order to demonstrate that they cannot return to the office in the context of rising case volumes of Covid-19 here; if he has consulted with the Chief Medical Officer in this regard; and, if so, if he will publish and-or provide those advices.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[54879\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000074#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he has taken to ensure that persons with a disability and-or who are immune compromised can return to departmental offices safely in the context of Covid-19; if he has, without prejudice and-or sanction arrangements in place in order for these cohorts to continue working from home in the context of rising case numbers; and if he has considered a reversal on the full return to the office by staff.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 84 and 85 together.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to those who are required to attend the workplace during COVID-19 is a matter for individual employers. <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist civil and public service organisations with their work-related obligations during COVID-19, the Civil Service HR Policy Division within my Department regularly issues Guidance and FAQs for Public Service Employers during Covid-19, which can be found here: www.gov.ie\/en\/news\/092fff-update-on-working-arrangements-and-leave-associated-with-covid-19-fo\/. This document is regularly updated to reflect any changes in public health guidance and government policy. Section 1.1 of this document, which is based on public health advice and the Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021, provides guidance for employers in relation to who should attend the work premise during the pandemic. In line with public health advice, a cautious and careful return to workplaces should take into account appropriate attendance levels, with the use of staggered arrangements such as non-fulltime attendance and flexible working hours, and that attendance is for specific business requirements only. <\/p>  <p>  The Guidance and FAQs for Public Service Employers during Covid-19, provides advice for high risk &amp;amp; very high risk categories of employees specifically under 2.1 and 2.2 in relation to their attendance in the workplace:  <\/p>  <p>  - FAQ 2.1 notes that in relation to those at high risk of illness from COVID-19, &ldquo;Employers should continue to facilitate this group where possible in terms of flexible working arrangements, including working remotely where such arrangements are appropriate to the business needs&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  - FAQ 2.2 notes that in relation to who are at very high risk, &ldquo;Employees should declare to their employer if they believe that they are at very high risk of COVID-19. Please refer to the HSE website for more information. The employer&rsquo;s Occupational Health service should be consulted for employees in the very high risk category, or to determine if an employee falls into this category, and to advise on whether the employee can attend the work premises. The Civil Service CMO advises that as our knowledge of COVID-19 has increased, some conditions that previously placed employees in the very high risk category now place them in the high risk category or in some instance in the normal risk category. In addition an employee&rsquo;s risk categorisation may now have changed due to vaccination and\/or history of recent confirmed COVID infection&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Civil Service Chief Medical Officer (CMO) conducts COVID -19 risk assessments when requested by the Civil Service employing organisation. This includes referrals where the employer is advised whether the employee is at general population or normal risk\/higher risk\/very high risk from COVID-19. This COVID -19 risk assessment follows the risk categorisation guidance developed by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The decision on the employee&rsquo;s place of work following this CMO risk categorisation is made by the employer in consultation with the employee, not the Civil Service CMO.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of those with a disability, requests for a remote\/blended working arrangement as a reasonable accommodation should be dealt with under the usual process as employers across the Civil Service continue to provide reasonable accommodations to staff who have a disability so that they can participate and advance in their employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000074#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000074#WRD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[54899\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000074#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the plans for the redevelopment of the Garda station in Greystones, County Wicklow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>The refurbishment of Greystones Garda Station is included in the &lsquo;Capital Works programme 2016-2021&rsquo; for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

(PAS) is the independent, statutory body that provides professional recruitment and selection services to the civil service.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the recruitment of fluent Irish speakers to the civil service, such speakers can apply for competitions that specifically require fluency in the Irish language.\u00a0 They can also apply for competitions that do not require fluency in the Irish language and express and, in doing so, indicate their fluency in Irish that may be taken into consideration for assignments to posts that may be vacant should they subsequently come under consideration for appointment.\u00a0 There is nothing to preclude candidates from applying from more than one competition provided they meet all eligibility criteria set out in the respective competition.<\/p>  <p>  PAS forms panels for general civil service positions that candidates are assigned from as and when vacancies are notified to PAS by civil service employers.\u00a0 The number of positions available to any particular panel depends on the demand from Departments\/Offices and adherence to their pay and numbers allocations.\u00a0 While every effort is made to endeavour that panels are not large, candidates are advised that placement on a particular panel is no guarantee of appointment to a position arising from their participation in a particular competition.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Irish Executive Officer panels formed from the 2019 competitions, my Department has recently authorised PAS to extend the expiry date of the current Irish Executive Officer panels to 31 December 2021.\u00a0 My Department is advised by PAS that a notification to this effect issued via the publicjobs.ie Messageboard system on 3 November to all candidates remaining on the current panel.\u00a0 A new Irish Executive Officer competition is due to be undertaken by PAS in January 2022 from which all future assignments will be made.\u00a0 I consider this an appropriate timeframe in terms of striking a balance between how long candidates may remain on panels against the need to refresh panels by allowing applications from those either not eligible at the closing date or who did not meet the standard at a point in time for a particular competition.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill, currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, proposes a 20% Irish language fluency target for all new hires to the public service by 2030 in line with Programme for Government commitments.\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Rural Development Strategy\u00a0&ldquo;Our Rural Future&rdquo;\u00a0that was launched in March by the Minister for Community and Rural Development, may also provide enhanced opportunities for

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. <\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing.

I had useful exchanges on situations of concern to Israel, Palestine and Jordan in the wider Middle East region, including in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the situation in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and on Ireland&rsquo;s role as facilitator of the UN Security Council Resolution on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). I also discussed Ireland&rsquo;s thematic priorities on the Council, including on the women, peace and security agenda and on climate and security issues. <\/p>  <p>  The Israeli and Palestinian component of this visit included a wide range of engagements in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ramallah as well as a field visit in the West Bank. I met with key representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well officials from UN agencies, think-tanks, student groups and civil society. <\/p>  <p>  On the Israeli side, I met with President Isaac Herzog, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, and Minister of Health Nitzan Horowitz. I had useful exchanges on a range of issues, including the issue of antisemitism and the response to Covid-19. In relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I restated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to constructive engagement on the Middle East Peace Process. I welcomed the outreach by members of the new Israeli Government with their Palestinian counterparts but underlined Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern at settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions in the oPt. I asked the Israeli government to cease unilateral actions, such as the recent announcement on settlements, which are illegal under international law and negatively impact the viability of a future Palestinian state. I emphasised the importance of civil society space and the vital role played by NGOs in any democracy, and expressed my concern at the recent designation of six Palestinian organisations as terrorist entities. <\/p>  <p>  On the Palestinian side, I met with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, and Deputy Prime Minister Ziad Abu Amr. I emphasised the need for democratic renewal in Palestine, particularly in light of the postponement of the May elections  and underlined the importance of the PA assuming its responsibilities with regard to the rule of law, freedom of expression and civil society engagement. <\/p>  <p>  During my visit I announced &euro;2.4 million in additional support for the Palestinian people. The package includes &euro;2 million for UNRWA, which provides essential services to 5.7 million Palestine refugees in the oPt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, and brings Ireland&rsquo;s support to the agency to &euro;9 million in 2021. The remainder of the funding will support the UN in providing humanitarian assistance in the oPt, UNICEF&rsquo;s work with Palestinian children and the West Bank Protection Consortium&rsquo;s activities with threatened communities in the West Bank.<\/p>  <p>  I visited communities in the West Bank, accompanied by officials from the UN and the West Bank Protection Consortium, where I saw first-hand the impact that the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements are having on the local Palestinian population. I also met with young Palestinian graduates from Ireland&rsquo;s Palestine Scholarship Programme. <\/p>  <p>  During my visit to Amman, I had the opportunity to have wide ranging discussions with the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi, including in relation to the Middle East Peace Process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG02100"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[55008\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the practical supports that are in place if Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol is triggered by the UK in respect of trade between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[55009\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will confirm the preparatory measures that have been taken in the event Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol is triggered by the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[55010\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the mechanisms that are in place by the Government which would help identify the circumstances which could entitle conditions necessary for Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol to be triggered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[55011\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol is triggered, the tariffs that could be imposed on the UK by the EU; the preparatory measures that are being considered for the protection of trade on the island of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 to 128, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il last week, any decision from the British government to trigger Article 16 would be irresponsible, unwise, and reckless. <\/p><p>The European Commission has listened to the concerns of citizens and business in Northern Ireland about the Protocol and produced a comprehensive set of proposals to address the issues that matter most to them. The Commission proposals represent a real opportunity for Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p>I believe that the Protocol will work if we allow it to with flexibility and pragmatism. The Protocol was agreed and ratified by this British Government and they have a duty to deliver on their commitments. Article 16 of the Protocol allows either party to take safeguard measures if the Protocol is leading to &ldquo;serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties&rdquo; that are liable to persist or to a diversion of trade. Any safeguard measures taken must be restricted in scope and duration to what is strictly necessary to remedy the situation. <\/p><p>If either party gives notice that they are considering use of Article 16, then in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex 7 of the Protocol, both sides should immediately enter into consultations in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly accepted solution. No unilateral measures should be implemented during the initial one month period. If, after a month, negotiations fail to agree a solution, the unilateral measures may come into effect. Any such action must be restricted in scope and duration to what is strictly necessary to remedy the situation. All other aspects of the Protocol will remain in place. Any unilateral measures taken will be subject to review at least every three months. <\/p><p>The UK has not as of yet notified the Joint Committee that it is considering taking safeguard measures under Article 16; nor is any detail available as to what such measures may encompass.<\/p><p>Since the Brexit referendum in 2016, the Government has dedicated substantial time and resources into preparing for a number of Brexit scenarios, including a no-deal outcome. This intensive effort across Departments and Agencies included the development of two Brexit Omnibus Acts; three Brexit Action Plans; substantial investment in the State&rsquo;s infrastructure and IT systems and the provision of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses, all of which have contributed to the ongoing resilience of the economy in the face of Brexit. Protecting the all-island economy and ensuring the continued unimpeded functioning of North-South supply chains and trade flows has been a key priority for the Government throughout the Brexit process, and robust systems and supports remain in place to help businesses navigate the ongoing challenges caused by Brexit.  While we would never wish to see the UK Government invoke Article 16, if this does occur we will engage with all stakeholders in light of the precise scope of the measures envisaged. <\/p><p>I believe that any misuse of Article 16 would have serious consequences, for the relationship between the UK and the EU, for the UK&rsquo;s relationship with Ireland, and for stability in Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>I urge the British Government to engage in good faith with the EU on the Protocol in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":239,"content":"<p>Question No. 126 answered with Question No. 125.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":240,"content":"<p>Question No. 127 answered with Question No. 125.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":241,"content":"<p>Question No. 128 answered with Question No. 125.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG03000"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[55013\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a passport application by a person (details supplied) will be reviewed and expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has already issued a passport to the applicant. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG03300"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[55174\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000077#WRG03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he is taking to address the shortage of consular appointments in the New York consulate.","asker":"1525","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>This relates to an application for a visa to the United States, for which the Department of Foreign Affairs plays no role.

During this first class of the school day windows should, weather conditions permitting, be partially opened (as per guidance in this document) to keep the room fresh and prevent stuffiness and condensation etc. This is in addition to and complements the end-of-day ventilation described above.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Achieving fresh air by having a number of windows partially opened as required rather than one window fully open can help to maximise the use of window driven natural ventilation distribution across the room without causing discomfort. In colder weather any local chilling effect can be offset by partially opening the windows nearest to and above the radiators.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their boilers operation temperatures are set at the recommended manufacturers&rsquo; guidance levels to maximise the available heat to the school.\u00a0 In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract, as best as possible, the impact of windows being open (partially when classrooms are in use and fully when not in use) in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Deployment of the above measures can be supplemented and enhanced by the use of Carbon Dioxide (CO2  ) monitors. These monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas\/rooms may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with\u00a0 the impact of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation within a room. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department considers the above practical steps and stepwise approach are sufficient to ensure good ventilation practices in school while at the same time ensuring an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Schools that identify inadequacies can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address enhancements on a permanent basis.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about\u00a0ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Where the above measures have been undertaken, and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room\/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000078#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000079#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[55133\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000079#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide additional capitation grants to schools that require them to cover heating and lighting costs in the context of Covid-19 mitigation measures in schools and the requirement for adequate ventilation.","asker":"1489","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding to Primary and Post-Primary schools by way of per capita grants.

Unemployment Payment (PUP) was introduced in an extremely short period of time in order to cushion the incomes of citizens following the onset of an unprecedented public health crisis. Within a month of the PUP scheme going live, over 507,000 people received at least one payment.\u00a0\u00a0 Recipient numbers peaked at 602,108 on 8 May 2020. My Department has processed in excess of 1.7 million applications for the PUP, from over 900,000 applicants and made almost 27.7 million separate PUP payments. The number of claims received and processed is equal to approximately 9 times a normal annual claim load. Delivering the scheme on such a scale and in such a short time represented a major achievement. <\/p>  <p>  At all times during this process, my Department has prioritised prompt claim processing and payment in order to ensure that people who had to cease their employment because of public health restrictions had the security of an income support payment. In addition, while prioritising prompt payment in the circumstances of the pandemic, payment and claim processing controls were applied to reduce the risk of incorrect or fraudulent payments.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In processing claims, my Department always has to strike a balance between applying tight controls and checks on claims on the one hand and not frustrating a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a payment on the other. This was particularly the case in the extraordinary and exceptional circumstances of Covid-19. Applying normal controls would have meant very long delays in processing the unprecedented number of claims received. This would have led to\u00a0severe financial hardship for many people and undermined the sense of social solidarity that was required to sustain the public health restrictions and combat the virus.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these concerns a range of controls were implemented and while not as extensive as would normally be the case the controls did help to\u00a0reduce and control the level of incorrect payments. For example, in the initial two months to end April 2020 the Department processed some 900,000 PUP claims, with around one third of these being rejected for failing to meet the control criteria.\u00a0 Controls on PUP have continued to be enhanced\u00a0over the last eighteen months, with a wide range of control work undertaken, including matching against Revenue records.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Overpayments can arise as a result of a statement or representation which was, to the knowledge of the person making it, false or misleading in a material respect or by the willful concealment of a material fact by a claimant, or by new facts or evidence which have come to light since a claim was made. It will be appreciated that a very high threshold of proof must be met to warrant a finding of fraud. <\/p>  <p>  Up to the end of October 2021, my Department has recorded 15,023 overpayments of the PUP totalling &euro;29.3 million, with &euro;10.2 million recovered to date. Of these figures, 443 cases, totalling just under &euro;1.5 million, were attributed to fraud. \u00a0Typically, overpayments have arisen where a person has failed to declare ongoing employment or where the person was not working prior to the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  All claimants for the PUP were required to confirm the date on which they last worked as part of the application process. Where this date predated the introduction of Covid related restrictions, their claim was rejected. In addition, from June 2020, all claims were checked against Revenue records to verify a history of previous employment. In a situation where a significant proportion of private employments were closed due to public health restrictions, along with the fact that claim inflows closely tracked the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions, it was reasonable to accept self-declaration as the basis for a loss of employment.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in addition to those who are fully unemployed, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance is also payable to individuals who work on a part-time basis. Many of those individuals lost their employment in exactly the same manner as the rest of those in the labour force and were entitled to claim PUP. In total, out of over 900,000 applications for PUP, just over 36,800 cases involved individuals who were claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance as part-time workers prior to their PUP claim.\u00a0 Payment of Jobseeker's Allowance ceased from the date of the award of the PUP payment in these cases. There is no evidence which suggests that persons who were in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance prior to the pandemic applied successfully for the PUP once the pandemic started with the exception of the part-time workers just referenced.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many social welfare payments, the PUP is not payable in respect of periods where a person is absent from the State. However, in line with the practice in relation to Jobseeker payments, a person may avail of a limited absence from the State of up to two weeks in a calendar year. \u00a0My Department carries out a range of checks to identify cases where an individual may no longer be in the State and takes appropriate follow up action. However, the volume of identified cases does not support a reliable estimate of the overall number of such cases.<\/p>  <p>  As is the case with all schemes, the Department is continuing take steps to\u00a0identify overpayment cases and to seek refunds and will do so in a measured way.\u00a0 Control activity\u00a0and work on the recovery of overpayments on the scheme will continue into next year.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000079#WRJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":325,"content":"<p>Question No. 155 answered with Question No. 154.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":326,"content":"<p>Question No. 156 answered with Question No. 154.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":327,"content":"<p>Question No. 157 answered with Question No. 154.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000079#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[55027\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000079#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made on a disability allowance application by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been awarded disability allowance (DA)\u00a0with effect from 25 August\u00a02021.

CORU&rsquo;s role is to protect the public by regulating the health and social care professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended). The Act seeks to protect the public by providing a system of statutory registration for designated health and social care professions. There are two forms of application to CORU; applications for the recognition of qualifications received outside the State and applications for registration. <\/p>  <p>  Where a health and social care professional qualifies outside the State and applies to register in Ireland, they must apply for the recognition of their qualification. Once a complete file has been submitted to CORU, a decision must issue within four months. Currently there is no waiting list for such applications. Nevertheless, CORU continues to innovate to shorten timeframes for these applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of applications for registration, CORU has informed my officials that the average processing time for an application for registration is 9.2 weeks for new applicants entering a profession. This represents an improvement on the previous average of 14 weeks. <\/p>  <p>  I met with the Chairperson and CEO of CORU earlier this year and raised the issue of timeframes for recognition of qualifications and registration. Following our discussion, a variety of measures have been initiated by CORU aimed at further reducing timeframes.\u00a0 CORU has informed my officials of two innovations that will further improve these processes. Firstly, applications for the recognition of qualifications received outside the State are now accepted for all professions through an online application system, which launched this year. Secondly, CORU has commenced the contemporaneous processing of recognition and registration applications. Once an applicant submits an application for recognition an invitation to initiate a registration application to run in parallel is issued. These initiatives, in addition to additional resources I have allocated to CORU, are anticipated to further reduce timeframes.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of opportunities for innovation and change have been identified by CORU, some are already underway, while work is beginning on others. For example work is underway to assess alternative approaches to facilitate recognition of EU qualifications which would reduce timeframes and CORU has also commenced a project to facilitate the digitisation and integration of all registrant related systems. <\/p>  <p>  My department will continue to support CORU in achieving its strategic vision and improving timeframes for all applicants into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000086#WRQ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[55179\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111000086#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the rationale for the application fees for health and social care professionals registering with CORU.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended) seeks to protect the public by providing a system of statutory registration for designated health and social care professions.\u00a0The Health and Social Care Professionals Council and\u00a0the\u00a0Registration Boards\u00a0it oversees\u00a0(collectively known as CORU)\u00a0are\u00a0governed by that Act.
