Earlier this month I visited Israel and Palestine for the fourth time in the last two years. I have also consistently engaged on this issue at EU and UN level. In February at Farmleigh, I hosted important discussions on the MEPP with a small group of EU and Arab foreign ministers, with whom I continue to discuss how we can contribute to the process of delivering a lasting peace.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that Ireland will &ldquo;honour our commitment to recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict.&rdquo; Successive Governments have seen recognition coming in the context of an overall peace agreement. In the context of widespread frustration at the lack of political progress towards an agreement, and not least in light of the views expressed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in 2014, we have discussed here in the Oireachtas the question of whether the formal recognition of Palestine, in advance of its full achievement on the ground, would be a helpful step in advancing a resolution of the Israel- Palestine conflict. <\/p>  <p>  One of the many factors bearing on this question is the importance of assessing whether recognition now would positively affect the peace process or merely be viewed as a symbolic gesture, swiftly overtaken and surpassed by events on the ground. Recognition by Ireland outside the context of an overall peace agreement would also undoubtedly affect Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing influence on the Middle East Peace Process at EU and international level, and it is imperative that such a step would not diminish Ireland&rsquo;s impact without delivering a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people. <\/p>  <p>  I have stated that I will be ready to recommend immediate recognition to the Government, if and when I believe it would be helpful in achieving our objective of a free and sovereign Palestinian State, or advancing the peace process in that direction.

This was my fourth visit to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I met with key representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as UN officials from UNRWA, UNTSO and OHCHR.<\/p>  <p>  On the Israeli side I met Prime Minister Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Katz. In both meetings, I set out Ireland&rsquo;s deep concerns about the impact of the continuing occupation, including the situation in Gaza, settlement construction and the demolition of properties in the West Bank and actions taken against Palestinians in East Jerusalem. I also raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the erosion of civil society space, and the importance of ensuring that there are no impediments to the holding of Palestinian elections.<\/p>  <p>  I had a frank discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu about actions taken by Israel over recent years which are jeopardising the viability of a two-state solution and thus the prospect of a just and lasting solution to the conflict for both peoples. I specifically raised comments he had made about annexation of the Jordan Valley. I also raised Ireland&rsquo;s well known view that settlements are illegal under international law. Although I am very conscious of the specific impact of the settlement announcment in relation to Hebron, given the gravity and extent of settlement activity, I focused on giving strong messages on Ireland's opposition, as a matter of principle, to all settlement activity. I stressed the urgent need to address the unsustainable situation in Gaza.<\/p>  <p>  On the Palestinian side, I met with President Mahmoud Abbas, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh and Dr. Saeb Erekat, Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. I also met with the Palestinian Minister for Education, Dr. Marwan Awartani, and signed a memorandum of understanding which outlined Irish support for the Palestinian education sector, and met with Minister Mazen Ghuneim, head of the Palestinian Water Authority. In these meetings I conveyed the importance the Irish people attach to the resolution of the Middle East Peace Process, something that has been a priority for me personally since I took office, supported the intention to hold elections, and discussed how Ireland and the EU can play a constructive role in the MEPP. <\/p>  <p>  During my visit to Gaza, I met with secondary school students from an UNRWA school in Jabalia, where I saw first-hand the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to supporting quality education for children.  I also met with senior UNRWA officials and discussed the humanitarian situation in the Gaza strip and the operational challenges facing the agency. I was pleased to announce that Ireland will provide an additional &euro;2.5 million in funding this year to support the delivery of these core services, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total support to UNRWA in 2019 to &euro;7.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  I also visited the Northern Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment (NGEST) where I met with Minister Mazen Ghunaim to formally launch Ireland&rsquo;s investment in support of the water sector. Ireland will contribute &euro;8.8 million to a joint project with France to build a solar power plant providing clean, reliable energy to the NGEST wastewater treatment plant. Water pollution is the leading cause of child mortality in Gaza. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of plans for new settlement construction in Hebron, my view is clear; any further settlement expansion would be deeply regrettable and would be likely to accentuate tensions in an already fragile situation. This is particularly the case following the Israeli Government&rsquo;s decision earlier this year not to renew the mandate of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron, which had played an important role in preventing violence. My officials will use appropriate opportunities to highlight Ireland's strong opposition to any settlement construction in Hebron.   <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work to ensure that the Middle East Peace Process remains high on the international agenda.

To date almost half of the fleet have been upgraded with the remainder due by early 2022. Additionally,\u00a0twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles\u00a0(AUVs) were acquired in 2017, and\u00a0in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles.

In 2019 a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3\/4 tonne 4 X4 vehicles, the first of which are expected to enter service in early 2020. A tender process is underway also for the supply of new 4 X 4 Troop Carrying Vehicles.

However, as noted in the White Paper Update, there is continuing potential for additional investment in military facilities and, with this in mind, a focussed five year infrastructure programme will be launched in January 2020. This will provide the means to channel available funds to where these will have the strongest impact, while acknowledging the potential for additional investment.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Update was undertaken while Brexit has continued to evolve. The Update notes that the precise security implications of Brexit remain hard to predict, albeit that the overall setting in which security resides may be adversely impacted. It is not clear, at this point, that any particular implications call for a defence response beyond what is committed in the White Paper. Prudent planning remains the essential relevant focus against the backdrop of the current position on Brexit, and the responsibility, in the first instance, of the Department of Justice and Equality, along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for internal security matters and the Revenue Commissioners for customs issues.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Overall, I am pleased with the outcome of the White Paper Update and I am satisfied that the Defence Forces will continue to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800077#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800077#WRC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[53504\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800077#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if a psychiatrist has been appointed to the Defence Forces to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>Following previous unsuccessful attempts in 2018 to recruit a\u00a0direct-entrant military psychiatrist and\u00a0locum psychiatrist\u00a0for the Defence Forces, sanction was sought from, and granted by,\u00a0the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to conduct a competition for a contracted civilian consultant psychiatrist.\u00a0The pay rates applicable are equivalent to those available in the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service\u00a0recently conducted\u00a0the\u00a0competition.\u00a0The closing date for applications was 26 September 2019.\u00a0\u00a0Interviews were held on 6 December 2019 and a candidate has been selected.

The decommissioned vessel L&Eacute; Aisling was withdrawn from service in 2016 after being in service since 1980 having well exceeded her notional life expectancy. In engineering terms, the equipment onboard was obsolete and the reliability and capability of the ship was impacted. In order for the Naval Service to carry out its roles as assigned by Government the fleet must be capable, reliable and safe to operate in the often hostile North Atlantic where sea conditions during prolonged winter storms are not exceeded anywhere in the world.<\/p>  <p>  Following\u00a0her decommissioning in 2016, I made the decision to sell the\u00a0former L&Eacute; Aisling by way of public auction to the highest bidder to maximise the return to the Exchequer. This is\u00a0in keeping with the Department's standing policy for the disposal of surplus defensive equipment. This approach is also in\u00a0accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2015 Report which\u00a0provides that &ldquo;a competitive sales process or auction should normally be used for the disposal of State assets with a significant market value.\u00a0 Such a process helps to ensure transparency and is more likely to achieve the fair market price.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  All weaponry systems, defensive equipment and specialist Naval equipment were\u00a0removed in their entirety from the decommissioned vessel prior to the sale.\u00a0The main weapon consisted of the L70 Bofors 40mm crew served cannon which was complemented by two 20mm auto cannons. All of these were directly attached to the deck and were removed in their entirety from the vessel. In accordance with Maritime law this means that the ship was no longer classified as a warship.\u00a0There were no armaments or offensive military capability\u00a0on board this vessel to sell or to export. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The sale of the decommissioned vessel was\u00a0by way of a public\u00a0auction, it was fully transparent and was open to all interested parties. The vessel was sold on an \"as seen\" basis to a Dutch shipbroker in March 2017,\u00a0and was removed from the Naval Base\u00a0in\u00a0Haulbowline and towed to\u00a0Holland by the purchaser.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Once the decommissioned\u00a0vessel was sold to the Dutch buyer, my Department ceased to have any trailing obligations in relation to the vessel and had no role or responsibility with regard to the future use of the vessel or the future supply chain for this vessel.

There are countries which have been required to take in large numbers of asylum seekers and others who continue to resist taking in any. Ms. Ylva Johansson, the recently appointed EU Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, has been tasked with developing a &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  We have consistently called for all EU member states to play their part in burden-sharing and helping to relieve pressure on frontline Member States. The issue of migration will not go away. Over 1200 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year. The EU must intensify its efforts to advance work in this area, particularly in relation to reform of the Common European Asylum System.\u00a0 Any solution should be based on responsibility and solidarity. I look forward to the von der Leyen Commission and the new Commissioner, Ms Johansson, coming forward with proposals early in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2015, Ireland has admitted over 2,900 people through the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR-led Refugee Resettlement Programme. Furthermore, we have allocated 100 spaces in 2019 to take people who were rescued in the Mediterranean and to process their applications for international protection. In addition, Ireland has been active in Search and Rescue missions in the Mediterranean since 2015. The Irish Naval Service has rescued more than 17,500 people since the beginning of the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also supports measures to address the root causes of irregular migration, through humanitarian and developmental programmes in developing countries. Indeed, Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of &euro;15 million for the EU&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Africa is the third highest per capita contribution by an EU Member State. <\/p>  <p>  Globally, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is one of Ireland&rsquo;s key UN partner agencies for development assistance and is the main agency providing protection and humanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). In 2019, Ireland provided a total of &euro;15.5 Million (US$17m) to UNHCR&rsquo;s global operations. This included &euro;9 million un-earmarked core funding and &euro;6.5 million via country programmes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While the social, economic and political stresses arising from the migration crisis are very considerable, it is essential that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met. This includes the reception conditions for applicants for international protection.\u00a0 Applicants who are in detention should be treated with full respect for human dignity and in accordance with relevant EU and international standards. This is an issue to which our Missions, working closely with local EU Delegations and Embassies of EU Partners, are and will continue to pay close attention to both in frontline and transit states currently receiving high levels of persons arriving from outside Europe seeking international protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800078#WRD06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800079#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[53809\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800079#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which he and the international community have identified the worldwide locations at which the most serious breaches of human rights have occurred and in respect of which alleviation measures are in train; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>The promotion and protection of human rights remain at the core of Irish foreign policy and we continue to monitor the human rights situations in many countries across the globe. <\/p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is a fundamental component of the EU's global engagment and Ireland strongly supports the work of the EU Special Representative on Human Rights, former T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore, to enhance the effectiveness and visibility of the EU's human rights policy.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also fully supports the UN mechanisms in the field of human rights, including the UN Human Rights Council, Special Procedures and the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, which play a crucial role in monitoring and responding to human rights violations and abuses.

Acts, it actively pursues claims harvesting websites.\u00a0 From its various consultations, the Department has been advised that the number of active &lsquo;claims harvesting&rsquo; websites operating in Ireland has drastically reduced in recent years from approximately 60 in 2016 to around 11 more recently, although this figure can fluctuate.\u00a0 The Law Society states that unfortunately, the process of identifying the owners of the websites is often frustrated by the sophisticated ways in which the website owners conceal their identity.\u00a0 For example, it would appear that many of the websites, which are operating in Ireland, may not actually be located within the jurisdiction nor within other EU countries.\u00a0 I understand that this factor increases the levels of complexity of investigations, as it can be particularly difficult to establish who the owners of the relevant websites are.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, my Department has been informed by the Law Society that 29 websites have been removed from the internet since 2014, with six of these websites removed since June 2019. \u00a0Another two websites have been identified as belonging to a company that has gone into liquidation.<\/p>  <p>  With the application of section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, solicitor advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present.\u00a0 Instead, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will maintain the restrictions of any advertisement which, in the opinion of the Authority, &ldquo;expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for personal injuries or seek legal services in connection with such claims.&rdquo;\u00a0 The Authority will be undertaking consultations for the making of regulations for the advertising of legal services by legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.\u00a0 It is my understanding that the new advertising regulations are planned to come into operation in Quarter 1 of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the above, it is clear that the regulation of claims harvesting websites is a complex matter but that the existing solicitor regulations have helped prevent such websites to evolve to become a more prevalent feature of the Irish personal injuries environment, in the way that they are in the UK, for example.\u00a0 I am satisfied that the relevant professional bodies are pursuing such websites to the extent that they can in light of the challenges that exist.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, my officials will continue to monitor the prevalence or otherwise of this issue.\u00a0 In addition, I would suggest that if anyone is of the view that particular solicitor firms are using such claim harvesting websites, they should report the matter to the Law Society\/Legal Services Regulatory Authority for investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[53540\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Central Bank is notified by life assurance companies of instances in which claims on policies are not paid out on the basis of non-disclosure;

This change was introduced by the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 and became operational on 1 December 2018. What it means in practical terms is that compensation levels payable from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) for third party motor insurance claims as a result of a motor insurer insolvency are aligned with the compensation levels paid out by the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) where a motorist is in a collision with an unidentified or uninsured driver. <\/p>  <p>  The 2018 Act requires motor insurers to\u00a0contribute an amount equivalent to 2% of gross motor insurance premiums annually to the MIICF until it reaches &euro;150m, and thereafter a rate of 1% until it meets its target level of up to &euro;200 million, when contributions cease. MIBI is required to invest these monies prudently to ensure that they are available to recoup the ICF for 35% of any future third party motor insurance claim which it is required to pay. <\/p>  <p>  Department of Finance officials have been engaging closely with MIBI in relation to its new role. On the 30th July MIBI submitted to the Minister the &lsquo;Motor Insurers Insolvency Compensation Fund Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2018&rsquo;. This has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. At end-December 2018, following one month of contributions made to it by motor insurers, the total contributions made by members equalled &euro;2,498,972. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to say exactly when contributions will cease as that will depend on amongst other things the volume of gross motor insurance premiums written in a year and whether there are any calls upon the fund. However, if we were to base\u00a0our projections on the amount of just under &euro;2.5 m collected for December 2018, this would result in an annual collection of &euro;30m a year, which means after 5 years, the deduction rate would fall to 1%. Therefore another 3 to 4 years of collection at this lower level would be required before the &euro;200m threshold was crossed. This would suggest a period of 8 to 9 years before contributions cease in a steady state scenario, and assuming no call upon the fund during this period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[53567\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number, extent and value of housing developments, commercial properties and land under the control of NAMA in Galway city and county; the equivalent figures for each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that NAMA&rsquo;s role is as secured lender and the property assets securing NAMA&rsquo;s loan portfolio remain under the ownership and control of debtors and receivers.<\/p><p>Set out in the attached file is information, in the format held by NAMA, relating to property collateral in Co.

No. 174 of 2019), earlier this year, the NCID has been established in the Central Bank of Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on Monday, 16 December 2019, the Central Bank of Ireland published the first National Claims Information Database Report on Private Motor Insurance, which includes aggregate data from the insurance industry.\u00a0 The aggregate nature of the data collected has meant that there are fewer legal and technical complexities involved, and that is why it has been possible to have the NCID established and reporting so quickly.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Both Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and I commend the work of the Central Bank in bringing this Report to fruition.\u00a0 We believe it is an excellent report, which provides an objective overview of private motor claims costs including legal costs over the last number of years. <\/p>  <p>  I would hope that going forward the increased transparency brought about by the NCID, along with other legislative changes, can help to provide more stability in the market, thus avoiding the peaks and troughs for consumers in terms of premium pricing.\u00a0 This should ultimately make the Irish market more attractive to new entrants and I would hope that this might be one of the outcomes of this exercise in time.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the Report shows that the insurance and legal sectors have both serious questions to answer regarding the difficulties we have faced over the last number of years with the price of motor insurance.<\/p>  <p>  It appears that insurers under-priced in the early part of this decade and then increased premiums beyond levels that were needed to cover losses incurred and consequently are now making significant profits.\u00a0 At the same time, the legal costs associated with the litigation settlement channel seem disproportionate when one considers that the report indicates that the award levels for those settlements under &euro;100,000 are not much higher than equivalent settlements in PIAB.\u00a0 In addition, the length of time to settle these claims is nearly two years longer than in PIAB, which in itself drives up the cost of insurance.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While it is true to say that the nature or severity of the injury claims settled in the different channels can vary significantly and there may be good reasons for pursuing litigation, I believe that this report makes it clear that in overall terms, PIAB offers the most cost effective settlement channel and I would hope that its settlement rates increase going forward.\u00a0 This is a key aim of the work of the\u00a0Cost of Insurance Working Group.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NCID Report also demonstrates why we must address award levels in this country if we want to see cheaper insurance premiums and an increased risk appetite from insurers.\u00a0 In this regard, the NCID Report shows that personal injury claims have been driving the cost of claims in recent years &ndash; representing 75% of the ultimate claims costs over the period.\u00a0 This is not sustainable in my view.\u00a0 This is all the more concerning as the Report shows that these increased costs are not being driven by a higher frequency of claims.\u00a0 I believe that our focus therefore must continue to be on the Judicial Council and its publication of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Injury Claims","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[53792\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800080#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the personal injuries pay outs will be published for properties under the ownership of his Department in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, my Department owns no properties.\u00a0 The State&rsquo;s property portfolio is under the ownership and management of the Office of Public Works.<\/p><p>The State Claims Agency (SCA) manages third party claims for costs arising from all categories of claims taken against the State so that such claims for costs are contained at the lowest achievable level.

As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of the National Lottery Regulator was established under legislation, with a range of functions, including to monitor\u00a0and enforce compliance by the Operator with the Act and terms and conditions of the Licence. The Regulator has been carrying out these functions, and reporting to me and to the Oireachtas, through an Annual Report,\u00a0on a regular basis since the Office was established. The Regulator has already identified and acted on breaches of the licence, and details are set out below.\u00a0In relation to this most recent issue, \u00a0I understand the Regulator is conducting further\u00a0inquiries into this matter and I look forward to the report on the issues.\u00a0<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Lottery is an important State asset which has raised over &euro;5.5 billion in funding for use by Good Causes, and\u00a0which supports thousands of jobs across the Irish economy,\u00a0since it was established in 1987. The National Lottery Act 2013 (&quot;the Act&quot;)\u00a0created the Office of the National Lottery Regulator to regulate the operation of the National Lottery\u00a0through the following functions:<\/p><p>1. To\u00a0procure the holding of the National Lottery.<\/p><p>2. To monitor and enforce compliance by the Operator with the act and terms and conditions of the Licence. <\/p><p>3. To\u00a0consider for approval certain matters relating to the National Lottery (including schemes for National Lottery games.)<\/p><p>4. To exercise the enforcement rights of any trademark of the National Lottery<\/p><p>5. To manage and control the National Lottery Fund.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Operator\u00a0of the National Lottery, Premier Lotteries Ireland (PLI) is responsible for ensuring that it operates the National Lottery in compliance with the Act and the terms of the Licence. The Regulator must exercise these functions with the objectives of ensuring the probity and long-term sustainability of the National Lottery, that the interests of participants are protected, and, subject to those objectives being met, maximise returns for good causes.\u00a0<\/p><p>The 118 page Licence to operate the National Lottery covers a very wide range of aspects which relate to the operation and regulation of the National Lottery including: payments to the National Lottery Fund, testing of draw equipment, use of trademarks, and the Operator's obligations at the end of the Licence period. There are also four Codes of Practice in place, including a Sales Code of Practice, a Participants' Code of Practice, an Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice and a Vetting Procedures Code of Practice. <\/p><p>The Regulator is empowered under the Act to obtain any information she requires from the Operator, and to appoint investigators where appropriate. The Licence provides that the Regulator may withhold an amount from the payments due to the Operator if the Operator has failed, or fails, to comply with any provision of the Licence. <\/p><p>With regard to the operation of games, section 45 of the Act requires that, prior to its launch, the Operator must submit a scheme setting out the rules of the game to the Regulator for consideration and approval. The Regulator determines whether the scheme for a new game is compliant with the Act and the Licence. Where a game is approved, the Operator is responsible for ensuring that it operates the game in compliance with the approved scheme. If the Operator wishes to amend the scheme of an approved game, it must submit such amendments to the Regulator for approval prior to implementing any changes.<\/p><p>The Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery monitors compliance by reviewing and querying various reports and activities, spot checks of compliance, and proactive themed reviews. Full details of these activities are available in the Regulator&rsquo;s annual reports on the Regulator&rsquo;s website. Breaches may be detected through one of these activities or through disclosure by the operator.<\/p><p>Any breaches of the Licence or the Act are reported to the Minister, and subsequently the Oireachtas, in the Regulator&rsquo;s Annual Report to the Minister in relation to the performance of his or her functions in the previous financial year pursuant to Section 22(3) of the Act. <\/p><p>This significant level of oversight reflects the importance of the National Lottery to the State. Since the establishment of the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery, four breaches of the Licence have been reported to the Minister and no breaches of the Act have been found. Three breaches were detected by the Office of the Regulator and one was disclosed by the Operator.<\/p><p>In 2016, an analysis by the Regulator of online play data led to a formal investigation. Following this investigation, in 2017 the Operator was found to have breached the terms of the Licence regarding players who have elected to self-exclude themselves from online play. <\/p><p>Separately, regular monitoring of the Operator&rsquo;s marketing communications in 2017 also led to a finding of a breach regarding the Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice.

Once consultants are appointed to progress the scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies as well as the public will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the scheme. <\/p><p>The next task for the steering group is to initiate the procurement of engineering design consultants and environmental consultants from the framework for such consultants, established by the OPW. It is expected that consultants will be appointed by the end Q1 2020.<\/p><p>While the three proposed schemes in County Monaghan, for Ballybay, Iniskeen and Monaghan town, are not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed, the OPW and Monaghan County Council will work closely to ensure that they will be commenced as soon as possible within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800081#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800081#WRG03100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800081#WRG03000"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[53449\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800081#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps being taken to ensure a child (details supplied) in County Cork receives an appropriate school place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>The provision of education for children with special needs, including those with Autism, is an ongoing priority for Government.  <\/p><p>Currently, almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;1.9bn is invested in supporting children with special needs.  <\/p><p>Since 2011 investment in Special Education supports has increased by 50%, which is significantly above the 7% increase in total student numbers over the same period. <\/p><p>As a result the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.<\/p><p>The majority of children with Autism attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. <\/p><p>But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.<\/p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide and has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.<\/p><p>Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. <\/p><p>Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.<\/p><p>Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.<\/p><p>In Cork alone there are 195 special classes and 13 Special Schools providing specialist support to children with more complex special educational needs.<\/p><p>The NCSE has planned a further expansion of special class and school places in Cork for next year. <\/p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, there is a range of supports including capital funding available to the school.<\/p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.

The confidentiality provisions of the 2002 Act require that the records relating to the personal testimony of individuals be disposed of following the dissolution of the Redress Board and Review Committee.The Board received legal advice in 2009 that Section 28(7) of the Redress Act <i>'contemplates only such disposal as will render all such documents unusable and the information contained in it inaccessible to anyone and that in practice the only issue for the Board and Committee is the mechanism by which this can be achieved&rsquo;.  <\/i>In other words, disposal means the destruction of the records<\/p><p>It is worth looking at the operating procedures used by the investigation Committee of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (attached).As you can see, the complainant and allrespondents got copies of all documentation.

These guidelines are available at <i>www.education.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>In relation to the provision of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) Support, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  <\/p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030\/2014, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie<\/i>, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  <\/p><p>In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.<\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.<\/p><p>SNA allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.<\/p><p>The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support because the requirements outlined in Circular 0030\/2014 were not complied with.  Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA support to the school to meet the special educational and\/or care needs of the children concerned.<\/p><p>Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2019\/20, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, it may continue to make applications to the NCSE.<\/p><p>As this question relates to the provision of SNA support to a particular child, I have referred the question to the NCSE for its direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800082#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800082#WRH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[53606\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800082#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the outcome of the patronage process for the new secondary school in Goatstown, Dublin 14 due to open in 2020 will be announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":380,"content":"<p>In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four years from 2019 to 2022, including a new 800 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Goatstown_Stillorgan_DLR school planning area as a regional solution .<\/p><p>The successful patrons of the six new post-primary schools to be established in 2020, including the new school referred to by the Deputy, were announced yesterday and the assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations are available on my Department's website (<i>www.education.ie<\/i>).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800082#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800082#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[53607\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800082#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the permanent school buildings for the recently opened primary and the post-primary school (details supplied) to be opened in September 2019 in an area will be included in the recently announced contract tenders for new school buildings; if not, when the contract tender for the permanent buildings for these schools is likely to be announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":383,"content":"<p>The permanent buildings for the schools referred to by the Deputy are being delivered under my Department's Design &amp;amp; Build Programme.

To date, the details of nine children have been provided to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  As a matter of priority, my Department in conjunction with the NCSE, completed its review of the special educational supports in place for each of the nine children and has now ensured that they are in receipt of appropriate special educational needs supports in line with the terms of various schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Supports available include Special Education Teaching support in schools; funding for Assistive Technology such as Soundfield and FM systems; and guidance from the NCSE&rsquo;s Visiting Teacher service on classroom adaptation and school staff training.<\/p>  <p>  All children are in receipt of special educational needs teaching support under the new model introduced in 2017 and revised in 2019.

Schools may utilise existing funding streams from the Department such as the Minor Works Grant or Grants for furniture and equipment for special education needs, to provide equipment, if these are recommended. <\/p>  <p>  All nine children have received assistive technology, in accordance with the criteria of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to teacher training, the NCSE can provide direct support to the schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible.

Spurred on by\u00a0advances in business technology and electronic media, those who operate harvesting entities in contravention of the law come\u00a0from a variety of countries, backgrounds and disciplines that are proving prohibitive in terms of cost and\u00a0scope to corral under\u00a0a single\u00a0regulator. <\/p>  <p>  Even in internet governance terms,\u00a0these operators\u00a0can literally change identity overnight when challenged, as they continue to be in this and other jurisdictions,\u00a0and can operate outside the scope of national or EU law while also\u00a0seeking to exploit several markets at once. These are the very substantial challenges that remain to finding\u00a0a\u00a0cost-effective regulatory response\u00a0at either national or international level to claims harvesting operations,\u00a0including as considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.<\/p>  <p>  As far as those\u00a0aspects of claims harvesting which fall within the remit of my own Department\u00a0may be\u00a0concerned, the key regulatory focus\u00a0continues to be\u00a0on the interface between claims harvesters and those solicitors with whom they would wish to\u00a0engage in a mercenary manner\u00a0to the detriment of our insurance regime. This is being applied diligently by the Law Society which continues\u00a0to take a strict approach against any offending solicitors or claims harvesters in this area\u00a0as appropriate to the Society's role as\u00a0the\u00a0regulator of solicitors under the Solicitors' Acts. <\/p>  <p>  This approach, which has proven highly effective, has a number of key legislative components. Section 5 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 generally prohibits unqualified persons from advertising a service of a legal nature that could otherwise be provided by a solicitor for a fee or reward.\u00a0 This includes such advertising in relation to personal injuries claims in the context of claims harvesting websites.\u00a0Moreover, section 62 of\u00a0the Solicitors Act 1954 prohibits solicitors from rewarding or agreeing to reward unqualified persons for the introduction of legal business and provides that any such agreement is void.\u00a0Under the Solicitors Advertising Regulations as\u00a0recently updated by the Law Society with my consent under S.I. No. 229 of 2019,\u00a0it remains the case that an advertisement intended to publicise or otherwise promote a solicitor in relation to the solicitor's practice shall be in such a form as shall not expressly or impliedly solicit, encourage or offer any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for damages for personal injuries or to contact the solicitor concerned with a view to such claims being made. <\/p>  <p>  From the active engagement by the Law Society and the on-going work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, I understand that\u00a0the number of active claims harvesting websites operating in Ireland has drastically reduced in recent years from approximately 60 in 2016 to around 11 in more recent times. It is also understood from the Law Society that 29 websites have been removed from the internet on foot of its efforts since 2014, with six of these websites removed since June 2019.\u00a0 The Society has previously issued relevant practice directions and directly notified claims referral companies found to be targeting solicitors about the statutory prohibition on solicitors paying referral fees. It has also\u00a0successfully pursued these matters\u00a0before the High Court and is, therefore, to be commended for the diligent and effective discharge of its\u00a0particular regulatory functions in response to this threat to our insurance regime.<\/p>  <p>  This strict\u00a0approach\u00a0is set to continue\u00a0under the new advertising provisions of section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. Under that section, such advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present but by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.

A pilot of this system has been completed and rollout to all Divisions will be completed in early 2020.<\/p><p>- PULSE has been updated to include Individual Victim Assessment and Victim Engagement screens, to record information about the victim themselves and any Garda interaction or engagement with the victim. PULSE has also been enhanced with new incident management functionality which will enable Garda supervisors monitor the progress of incidents from initial data input right through to court outcome stage. This is an interim step pending the implementation of the new Crime Investigations Management System.<\/p><p>-  A new Crime Investigations Management System will allow for the management of activities completed as part of an investigation, maintain a full history of the chain of events in an investigation, manage information gathered, and decisions\/actions taken. It will also integrate closely with the new Document and Content Management System, the new Property and Exhibits Management System, and other Garda IT systems.<\/p><p>- A new e-Vetting system is operational which provides online processing of applications for Garda vetting for persons working with children and vulnerable persons. This system won the national eGovernment Award for 2017<\/p><p>- A new Anti-Money Laundering application (GoAML) which supports Financial Intelligence Units to counter Organised Crime and Terrorist Financing and Money Laundering was implemented in June  2017<\/p><p>- A new Intelligence Management System has been deployed and is operational to provide a single secure repository of sensitive intelligence gathered by operational members<\/p><p>- A Rosters and Duty Management System is currently being deployed on a phased basis across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>Further and as the Deputy is aware, the Mobility project is ongoing and involves the provision of modern technical facilities to permit Garda members to access PULSE-held data using smartphones.

The Defence Forces provided expert assistance and the investigation involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland.

They would, of course, work in close co-operation with the PSNI where that could advance the investigation. <\/p>  <p>  I would call on anybody with any information that may be relevant to this case, even at this remove, to bring it to the attention of the Garda Authorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800084#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seeker Accommodation","counter":512,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800084#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":513,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[53705\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800084#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the questions raised regarding a centre (details supplied) for asylum seekers; the action he will take in response to the concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department's focus is on helping firms to improve their competitiveness and innovation, and to diversify markets. <\/p><p>The suite of enterprise and finance supports now in place covers the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.<\/p><p>Since 2016, my Department and its agencies have worked to prepare Irish businesses for the potential challenges posed by Brexit by helping them to assess their preparedness and helping them to implement practical action plans in areas such as customs, supply chain and sourcing, and financial management. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s suite of Brexit supports includes preparedness vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets and innovation supports through Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland. Supports and advice are also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  <\/p><p>The most immediate consequences of a hard Brexit are likely to be currency movements, supply chain constraints, delays, duties and tariffs. In the first instance, there will be a strain on the working capital position of businesses.  <\/p><p>Of my Department's suite of supports, the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme is designed to address working capital challenges brought about by Brexit. Under the Scheme, loans of up to &euro;1.5 million are available at a rate of 4% or less, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available on an unsecured basis. By contrast, the &euro;300m Future Growth Loan Scheme is designed to support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  <\/p><p>InterTradeIreland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 5,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  <\/p><p>ITI offers Brexit Planning Voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.  <\/p><p>ITI Brexit Planning Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000\/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.<\/p><p>In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit. The online &ldquo;Bitesize Brexit&rdquo; resource is a one-stop-shop for cross-border traders, presenting information in easily digestible segments and includes specific actions businesses should take in preparing for Brexit.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland also recently launched 12 &lsquo;Brexit Essential&rsquo; questions aimed at helping exporting businesses further prepare and take action ahead of the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  <\/p><p>My Department, in association with the Department of Education and Skills and key industry partners, has also launched a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The new initiative, called Clear Customs, comprises a training programme and a customs financial support to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning new staff to customs roles.<\/p><p>In addition, the Government has held over 100 Brexit information seminars and events since last September. I also have been convening regular roundtable discussions with the main retail grocery and distribution players since December of last year to better understand contingency planning within the sector on food supply. Revenue, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Dublin Port and relevant Government Departments also attend these meetings.<\/p><p>With the deadline for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU having now shifted to 31 January, and with the general election now behind us, Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland. I want businesses, particularly those most impacted by Brexit, to know my Department and its agencies are here to help. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme<\/th>       <th>Uptake at 6 December 2019 unless otherwise specified<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Brexit\u00a0Loan Scheme<\/td>       <td>919 applications for eligibility received, 828 approved by SBCI, 219 loans progressed to sanction at\u00a0bank level to a value of &euro;47.5 million.<br \/><br \/>Of the approved applications to date, 160 were reapplications as eligibility expires after six months.<br \/><br \/>Data as of the 12th December 2019<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Future Growth Loan Scheme<\/td>       <td>2,506 applications for eligibility received, 2,350 approved by SBCI, 650 loans progressed to sanction at\u00a0bank level.

An evaluation piece is needed and HEI will provide input as to what additional counselling might be required before a final submission will be made.<br \/><br \/>Department of Education agreed a package of &euro;57 million in additional current funding to be invested in higher education initiatives in 2019 alongside &euro;41 million additional funding for pay deals and pensions in the sector. This will fund provision for 3,500 additional places, initiatives to support innovation and performance awards, teaching and learning capacity, 1,000 additional places on Springboard+, research funds for Institutes of Technology\/TUs, part-time and flexible learning. There will be also be a strengthening of counselling services in higher education. Total funding in higher education will be &euro;337m higher in 2019 than in 2016 (current funding increase of &euro;260m since 2016 and capital funding increase of &euro;79m since 2016).

This campaign was launched on the 12 November 2018 in University College Cork.  The HSE funding has been used to create a new campaign logo and tagline, three new posters to address the effects that Alcohol, Sleep and Exams can have on mental health and ways to help manage any stress related to those issues. A new leaflet with more information on protective factors and ways to seek help will also be produced as well as content on both USI.ie and yourmentalhealth.ie.

Working with youth groups and community groups, service providers have been asked to try to include youth friendly spaces so that mental health can be supported. The thrust of Government policy has been towards enhancing mental health support in the  community since &lsquo;A Vision For Change&rsquo; was adopted in 2006. This policy will be continued when the refreshed policy is published later this year.<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Accessibility and Alignment<br \/><br \/>8.1 - Pathfinder should carry out a detailed assessment of the services and supports currently available in relation to youth mental health, in order to identify gaps in service provision and to scope what improvements could be achieved through greater coordination<br \/><br \/>8.2 - The HSE should improve provision of mental health supports to young people at the primary care level to reduce the pressure on the tertiary referral services and improve waiting times<br \/><br \/>8.3 - The HSE should establish a National Lead for Youth Mental Health and a Lead for Youth Mental Health in each Community Health Organisation (CHO) to co-ordinate the provision of services and address gaps in service provision, including out of hours services. The CHO Leads will liaise with relevant agencies to develop appropriate communication protocols, standardised assessment processes and coordination of service provision. This joint working will bring together expert stakeholders to identify and address potential blocks to service provision and seek to reduce current wait times nationally with the introduction of other more appropriate interventions in primary care.<\/td>       <td>Assessments of current services are being discussed by TUSLA as part of their service provision in agreement with DCYA. They have initially suggested that overview of services would need to take place for all of their services, but that this would need to include mental health services and that therefore they may be in a position to complete this recommendation. I will have more detail once I meet with Tusla. <br \/><br \/>Part of the recommendation refers to recruitment of HSE leads but the job specifications for full time staff are hard to define.

This research aims to:<br \/><br \/>1.         To identify mental health services in Ireland that currently deliver, or are interested in developing and delivering family-focused intervention(s) for families where a parent has a diagnosed mental health problem (and their children aged 0-18 years). <br \/><br \/>2.

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. <\/p><p>Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. <\/p><p>My Department is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020.

The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National NIMIS Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the National Treatment Purchase Fund for data collection and data management expertise <\/p><p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) further advise that they do not currently store patient demographic data (including names, addresses or dates of birth) for patients on the Diagnostics waiting list and hence do not have the data to provide an answer to this query. The Diagnostics waiting list data is aggregated to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MRI and Ultrasound. The data is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting lists.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of children in County Wexford awaiting an NTPF appointment,\u00a0 the NTPF works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient\/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant\/specialist at an outpatient clinic. <\/p><p>The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first.

increased, but neither the precise distribution nor the population density of these species is currently known. Deer appear to be a localised issue in many areas.\u00a0 In this context, there is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner. It is critical that landowners take ownership over this issue and organise properly to implement deer management measures on their lands in the correct and sustainable manner.<\/p><p>In 2015, my Department, together with the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are abundant. The Irish Deer Management Forum was established to implement the various actions listed in the Report. The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, as well as representatives from both Departments.\u00a0 The Report provides for a review of the workings of the Irish Deer Management Forum after three years.\u00a0 Both my Department and the Department of Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht are currently examining the future direction of the Forum and its aims in the context of representation on the Forum, agreed work plans and funding mechanisms. <\/p><p>Adoption of best practice is fully supported by both Departments and the majority of deer management stakeholders. Best practice guidance, adapted to Irish Conditions was published by the Irish Deer management Forum during 2018 and can be accessed via .<\/p><p>A number of initiatives have been carried out in Co. Wicklow with a view to defining locally-led approaches to cooperative deer management. My Department is currently supporting a project led by the Wicklow Deer Management Partnership and Wicklow Uplands Forum, aimed at improving cooperation between landowners and local hunters. This project builds on previous experience in Wicklow through projects such as the Ballinastoe Deer Management Project, the Calary Deer Steering Group and the Calary\/North&ndash;East Wicklow Deer TB survey. These projects provide a good example for other local groups to follow, in areas affected by deer related issues. <\/p><p>The Manor Kilbride Deer Management Group in West Wicklow has also produced very useful and practical code of practice for landowners, to guide successful deer management implementation on farmland, and to formalise agreements between landowners and hunters. <\/p><p>The deer grazing assessment protocol developed by the Wicklow Deer Management project in conjunction with Teagasc is an example for a significant methodology developed for measuring the impact of deer in agriculture, and to improve awareness of deer issues among farmers. <\/p><p>I am encouraging farming groups and local communities concerned with deer population issues to look at the examples from Co. Wicklow and consider how they can follow these in their own areas.<\/p><p>In relation to forestry, my Department introduced a Deer Fencing and Tree Shelter Scheme to protect forests from predation by deer in 2018 as deer can cause serious damage to trees, particularly in native woodlands. Additionally, my Department has also engaged with the Society of Irish Foresters, Teagasc and Third Level Institutes in the delivery of deer management training to professional Foresters and Contractors through a series of seminars and field training events.

The Digital Skills for Citizens Scheme is an initiative under the National Digital Strategy for Ireland. My Department provides funding to community and not-for-profit organisations to deliver informal basic digital skills training where people attending classes will learn the skills they need to take their first steps to getting online. <\/p><p>Training is taking place across all counties and is targeted at people over 45, farming communities, small business owners, the unemployed, persons with disabilities and disadvantaged groups. This Scheme replaced and builds on the BenefIT Scheme that my Department operated between 2008 - 2016 which delivered over 157,000 training places.<\/p><p>Since training commenced under the Digital Skills for Citizen Scheme in 2017, &euro;5.5 million has been invested in providing 10 hours of free basic digital skills training to over 54,000 participants including 20,500 citizens over the age of 65. <\/p><p>The Digital Skills for Citizens Scheme is improving wellbeing, raising awareness about online services and providing the opportunities for family and friends to stay connected, therefore reducing loneliness as well as achieving cost savings and efficiencies. <\/p><p>My Department also funds a number of energy efficiency grant schemes that are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Over 400,000 households have carried out energy efficiency upgrades with the help of these grants, making their homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to run. <\/p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme established in 2016 as a joint energy, social and health policy initiative, was designed to objectively measure and validate the health and wellbeing impacts of improving the living conditions of vulnerable people living in energy poverty with chronic respiratory conditions, demonstrating the multiple benefits of energy efficiency. Over 1200 homes in the pilot area have now been upgraded. Older participants have reported that the scheme has been very beneficial to them.<\/p><p>Under the Climate Action Plan 2019, the Government is committed to implement a carbon tax rate of at least &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, accompanied by a trajectory of increases over successive annual Budgets. This would raise an additional &euro;6 billion that could be invested in decarbonising the economy while also protecting the most vulnerable from the increases in living costs associated with the carbon tax. This commitment will send a strong signal to householders and firms of the need to invest in low-carbon alternatives, where possible. Budget 2020 confirmed a &euro;6 increase in the carbon tax for 2020. This is projected to raise &euro;90 million in 2020, all of which will be ring-fenced to support climate action and protect those most vulnerable.<\/p><p>This increase applied from midnight on Budget Day to auto fuels but its application to other fuels will be delayed until May 2020, after the winter heating season. The concept of a Just Transition and protecting the most vulnerable are at the heart of the Climate Action Plan. Budget measures which will support Just Transition actions in 2020 included: <\/p><p>- Using &euro;13m from Carbon tax revenue in 2020 to retrofit the homes of people living in or at risk of energy poverty through the Warmer Homes Schemes. The total 2020 funding available will be &euro;52.8m. <\/p><p>- Using &euro;21m from Carbon tax revenue in 2020 to make changes to the Fuel Allowance Scheme led by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which will increase the income of households who get the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week (an annual increase of &euro;56).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS02100"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[53638\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of new staff recruited to his Department from January 2019 to date; the title of each employment position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":970,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the following table:   <table>    <tr>       <th>Title of Employment<\/th>       <th>Number recruited<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Administrative Officer<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Principal<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Secretary<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clerical Officer<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cyber Security Developer\/Analyst<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cyber Security Specialist<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Driller<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Executive Officer<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>ICT Apprentice<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Principal Officer<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Senior Geologist<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Technical Scientific Policy Advisor<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":971,"content":"<p>Question No. 375 answered with Question No. 366.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prospecting Licences","counter":972,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS02500"},{"type":"question","counter":973,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[53691\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the progress made to date in assessing all applications for renewal of prospecting licences in the Connemara area; when a decision will be made on each one; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":974,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 42 of 16 October, 2019.

In July 2019, Employment Permits Section processed more employment permit applications (1,828) than during any month in the past 11 years.  Quarter 3 of 2019 was the busiest Quarter in the last 11 years with 5,072 permit applications being processed so the changes currently being implemented within Employment Permits are resulting in higher outputs and reduced processing times.  <\/p>  <p>  An independent Business Process Review (BPR) has been carried out to identify further efficiencies that can be implemented in the short term and as a first step in the development of a new IT processing system during 2020 which will take advantage of all the new technologies available, including full digitisation.

It is anticipated that the implementation of the recommendations of the Review, including the implementation of a new IT processing system, will result in further streamlined processes and reduced processing times.<\/p>  <p>  My officials have been proactively engaging with customers to notify them of current processing timelines through email, meetings and regular updates on the Employment Permits section of my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants are advised to apply for the employment permit at least 12 weeks in advance of the expected start date so that any impact of the current extended processing timelines on recruitment timeframes is minimised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Transport Authority","counter":990,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS04300"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[53557\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800092#WRS04400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has provided funding for a new train station and related infrastructures to Irish Rail in respect of a proposed strategic housing development in the Shankill and Bray areas;

Furthermore, additional Government supplementary funding of &euro;7 million has been provided to the agencies at the end of 2019, primarily to support accelerated tourism marketing initiatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of Brexit.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, I secured an allocation of almost &euro;186 million for tourism, up 10% (over &euro;17m) on the 2019 allocation. This will help to ensure that the agencies remain equipped to deal with the\u00a0challenges\u00a0caused by\u00a0Brexit as the situation evolves, particularly in those regions most exposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1072,"content":"<p>Question No. 409 answered with Question No. 405.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme Funding","counter":1073,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1074,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[53825\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will reintroduce specific funding for the local improvement scheme in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1075,"content":"<p>As we outlined to the Deputy last month, the maintenance of roads not taken in charge by local authorities is\u00a0the responsibility of the relevant landowners.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However Section 81 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides the statutory basis for the Local Improvements Scheme (LIS).\u00a0 Under that Scheme, funding can be provided by the Minister for Transport to local authorities for the construction and improvement of non-public roads (that is roads not taken in charge by local authorities) which meet the very specific criteria set out in the Act:  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0A contribution from the beneficiaries is required in all cases. Section 81 (4)(a) of the Local Government Act, 2001 states that assistance by a road authority under the LIS is conditional on a financial contribution by the relevant parties.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Section 81 of the 2001 Local Government Act also provides that, after consultation with the Minister for Transport and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, another Minister may make a grant to a road authority in relation to non-public roads in accordance with a Scheme made by that other Minister.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Therefore State assistance can be provided under the statutory Local Improvement Scheme and up to 2012 my Department did provide ring-fenced funding for this scheme. However, due to the major cutbacks in roads funding arising from the financial crisis, it was necessary for the Department to stop\u00a0 providing dedicated funding\u00a0for LIS in 2012 and there was no funding for LIS in that year.<\/p>  <p>  After that from\u00a02013 to 2017, while there was no separate allocation for the Local Improvement Scheme,\u00a0local authorities\u00a0could use a proportion of their Discretionary grant\u00a0for the\u00a0Local Improvement Scheme if they chose to do so. The allowable proportion of Discretionary Grant was 7% in 2013 and this was increased to 15% from 2014 onwards.\u00a0 The reason this approach was taken was that it was considered that Councils were best placed to decide whether to concentrate the limited grant funding available on public roads or to operate a local improvement scheme\u00a0 for non-public roads.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2017, my colleague the Minister for Rural &amp;amp; Community Development reintroduced dedicated funding for the Local Improvement Scheme and is continuing to fund the Scheme. In light of the significant funding being put into LIS by that Department and the\u00a0pressing need to direct resources into maintaining and renewing\u00a0public roads, it was decided that the option of allocating a proportion of the Discretionary grant to LIS would no longer apply from 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While I am open to discussing the position in relation to LIS with Minister Ring, should he wish to do so,\u00a0 I am loath to divert\u00a0funding from public roads to non-public roads when\u00a0funding for public roads\u00a0is still below the level needed to achieve \"steady state\" and\u00a0significant funding is being made available\u00a0by Minister Ring for the\u00a0LIS\u00a0- close to &euro;50 million\u00a0since 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":1076,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[53835\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding the Julianstown bypass following the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport meeting on 25 September 2019; if his Department has met with Meath County Council as promised at that meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1078,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In this way, the NCS aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to appropriately incentivise employment and education\u00a0or training for parents, a policy objective that is known to benefit child and family outcomes.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to\u00a0income-based subsidies\u00a0awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week, or from September 2020, 45 hours per week).\u00a0 The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; are set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and are comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on\/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where a parent is not engaging in work or study, the child will only be eligible for the standard number of hours of subsidy, that is 15 hours per week . From September 2020, this will increase to 20 hours.\u00a0It is also important to note that the subsidy will only be payable during non-term time. This policy decision seeks to make the best use of finite investment for the highest number of families, to encourage labour market activation, to avoid poverty traps in some instances, and is also consistent with evidence on what is best for children.\u00a0\u00a0Research evidence supports shorter\/part time\u00a0hours in high quality Early Learning and Care services while school attendance also meets children&rsquo;s development needs generally.<\/p>  <p>  The extra hours available from September 2020\u00a0are targeted at supporting children whose parents are not in work or study, and also working families needing school age childcare. They also respond to concerns expressed by one parent groups.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that\u00a0\u00a0the maximum subsidy rates compare very well overall with existing targeted scheme subsidy rates, while acknowledging that the schemes do not lend themselves to easy comparison.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits of moving to an income-basis for eligibility include clarity, reduction of welfare traps, and equity. Eligibility criteria will now be on a single, clear basis, there will be increased support for progression into employment and retention in employment, and there will be equity in ensuring that low-income working families are not excluded from benefitting from subsidised childcare.<\/p>  <p>  The new Scheme is based on the principle of progressive universalism &ndash; providing a level of support to all families while providing additional targeted support to families with lower incomes. As a result of this measure, all families will be able to take part in the NCS. This widens participation and removes any potential stigma that may attach to families who benefit from the Scheme, increasing the likelihood that all service providers will choose to participate.<\/p>  <p>  There may be a small number of cases where a family who is currently receiving the maximum rate for\u00a0full-time\u00a0childcare under an existing programme may receive less under the National Childcare Scheme, particularly if their child is in school age childcare\u00a0 rather than full-time childcare.\u00a0 In such cases, the family can remain on their current payment in the transition period following the Scheme&rsquo;s launch. I have committed to ensuring that no one loses out in the transition to the new scheme through the &ldquo;saver&rdquo; arrangements. This means that persons registered on the CCSP or TEC schemes before they close, and who retain their eligibility, will be able to remain on them\u00a0indefinitely.<\/p>  <p>  New applications for CCSP closed on 15th\u00a0November, and applications to the TEC schemes will close from 14th  \u00a0February 2020. Parents using the saver arrangement can move over to the NCS at any point. The Parent Information line can help parents to understand which scheme will serve their family better.  \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents.\u00a0The scheme will be reviewed after 12 months and closely monitored thereafter to ascertain if it is meeting its stated objectives.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.\u00a0 As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Data","counter":1109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1110,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[53738\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU04600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount spent on advertising in 2018 and to date in 2019 on Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1111,"content":"<p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs did not incur\u00a0expenditure on advertising relating to Brexit in 2018 or 2019.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":1112,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1113,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[53768\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800094#WRU04900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the supports that exist for na&iacute;onra&iacute;; and the estimated cost of increasing the supports by 5%.","asker":"1310","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1114,"content":"<p>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am conscious of the value of supporting the provision of services in the Irish language to children at an early age, and of the role pre-schools can play in promoting Irish as a living language.

Decision makers (both Deciding Officer and Appeals Officers) would then apply these criteria to all cases that came before them and depending on the circumstances of each case, as assessed by reference to these criteria, an individual decision would be made in each case.\u00a0 This approach was a precursor to the subsequent development on a tripartite basis of the Code of Practice\u00a0for \u00a0Determining Employment or Self-Employment of Individuals Status under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a code which was subsequently updated in 2007\u00a0under the \u00a0Towards 2016 Social Partnership Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Chief Appeals Officer has also advised me that she does not as a rule take group decisions based on test cases.  However, she has advised that occasionally, and usually where a number of workers engaged by the same employer are concerned and have individually submitted an appeal, she is asked to make decisions on a &lsquo;sample&rsquo; number of cases. The Chief Appeals Officer has agreed to this approach in very limited circumstances and only with the agreement of both the employer and the workers concerned. This approach has not been adopted during the period of her tenure in any case of an appeal where the classification of a worker as an employee or self-employed is the issue under appeal. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This approach can be an efficient way of dealing with issues that are common in appeal cases and where there are a number of workers attached to an appeal. However, the approach cannot compromise the integrity of the appeal process or deny any individual\u00a0interested party due process. Each individual\u00a0always has the opportunity of having any evidence in their own case presented to and considered by an Appeals Officer.

This will be achieved through blended delivery, involving increasing the social housing stock by 50,000 homes, through build, acquisition and leasing programmes, and supporting some 88,000 further households through the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.<\/p><p>A range of housing options are necessary to ensure a supply of accommodation to meet different types of social housing need. Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important contributor to meeting this objective and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 will be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources and funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). The leasing programme secures properties from a wide range of lessors and through the various leasing schemes.<\/p><p>High quality secure properties, which represent value for money and are available on a long-term basis, are being targeted by local authorities around the country to accommodate people on local authority waiting lists.  The Government has increased significantly the delivery expected from local authorities through their social housing build programme, but it remains the case that more homes can be provided through leasing than could reasonably be expected to be delivered under construction and acquisition programmes alone. In addition, the cost of delivering social housing units under the traditional construction and acquisition model is not adequately captured by the up-front capital expenditure as each unit will carry a stream of ongoing costs over the long-term including management, maintenance and remediation. Furthermore, during the term of the lease, the responsibility for structural matters remains with the property owner and not the local authority.  At the end of the lease term, the dwelling can require major renovation or upgrading resulting in a substantial capital cost, which under leasing is borne by the owner rather than the local authority.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to increasing the supply of social housing and a primary focus continues to be the construction of new social housing homes. However, it is important that local authorities have the capacity to respond to local residential property markets and that they have the tools to provide a range of accommodation types in all of the areas where social housing need arises. <\/p><p>HAP, a social housing support being provided by local authorities, is one such tool.  HAP will replace Rent Supplement for those with a long-term housing need who qualify for social housing support. The introduction of HAP means that local authorities can now provide housing assistance for households with a long-term housing need, including many long-term Rent Supplement recipients. At the end of Q3 2019, nearly 67,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were more than 50,000 households actively in receipt of HAP support and over 29,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. However, the introduction of HAP has not resulted in increased usage of the private rented sector by the State &ndash; at end 2018, there were almost 6,000 fewer tenancies supported through Rent Supplement, Rental Accommodation Scheme or HAP than at end 2014, when the HAP scheme commenced.<\/p><p>HAP is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. Budget 2019 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;422 million. This is allowing for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019, as well as supporting the roll-out of the Homeless HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country. With 68,693 households on our waiting lists, the combination of 50,000 social housing homes and 88,000 HAP and RAS supports, which will be funded by the Government out to 2021, means that both long term and flexible options will be available to those on our social housing waiting lists.  <\/p><p>Details on the Exchequer funding for HAP are set out in the table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>2017<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Outturn<\/td>       <td>&euro;152.69m<\/td>       <td>&euro;276.6m<\/td>       <td>&euro;422m (allocated)<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Budget 2020 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;502.7 million. This will enable a further 15,750 households to be supported, as well as continuing support for the over 52,000 existing HAP tenancies which will be in place at end 2019. The 2021 budgetary provision for housing programmes will be determined in the context of the relevant estimates process.<\/p><p>During the period 2016-2018, the housing needs of some 91,000 households were supported under current programmes, including the HAP and RAS schemes. This figure includes continuing to provide support to those already in homes supported under the programmes concerned, and also the additional tenancies established during that period. If the funding provided for these 91,000 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes, it would have secured some 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,500 households. Looking at it another way, it would take almost &euro;20 billion to provide a new build local authority home for those 91,000 households. <\/p><p>I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for meeting the range of housing needs that exist nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800096#WRW03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maritime Spatial Planning","counter":1219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800096#WRW03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[53727\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121800096#WRW03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress being made towards increasing the percentage of maritime area designated as marine protected areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1221,"content":"<p>Ireland has undertaken to expand its network of Marine Protected Areas in accordance with commitments made under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the National Biodiversity Action Plan (2017-2021), the 1992 OSPAR Convention and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).\u00a0 On 23rd October this year I announced the formation of an expert Advisory Group to advise my Department and to make recommendations on the processes required and the challenges to be addressed in the extension of Ireland's Marine Protected Area network.<\/p><p>The Advisory Group is being chaired by Professor Tasman Crowe, Director of University College Dublin's Earth Institute, and it will be holding its inaugural meeting today (Wednesday 18 December).

Ireland signed up to the Agreement in 2003.   The agreement includes a commitment that &ldquo;Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables.\"  This is because there is slow accumulation of lead from shot in wetlands where hunting occurs.  The lead is generally harmful in the environment and can also be consumed by wildfowl.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Agreement was signed, the European Commission has published a draft Regulation for consideration by Member States on the use of lead shot in wetlands following a report on the matter by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).  It is my understanding that the proposal, should it ultimately progress into law, would make provision for a lead-in time to facilitate the making of arrangements to source alternatives to lead shot. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is aware that any change to the regulations around the use of lead in gunshot could provide a range of difficulties to transition to new guns\/gunshot for many gun owners in Ireland, including farmers and hunters, as many gun owners could have to make alternative arrangements, in many cases to purchase new guns. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and the other relevant Government departments, are fully committed to ensuring that this matter is addressed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, including farmer and hunters, and that all potential impacts are fully considered.
