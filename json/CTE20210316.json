The Business Committee referred the matter to this committee and the question for consideration is whether a waiver of PLS should be granted.<\/p> <p>  I will read the note on privilege.  Members attending from their Oireachtas offices are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their participation in this meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at this meeting.  Members are asked not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Members are familiar with all the other aspects of privilege when attending in Leinster House.  Since members are not attending in the committee room, the Debates Office has asked that each speaker be clearly identified by name to help ensure the accuracy of the official report.<\/p> <p>  A request was made to waive PLS of the Residential Tenancies Bill 2021 due to the urgency of passing the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas in a timely manner.  We were requested to waive PLS as it was felt that the time it would take would mean there would not be time for the Bill to pass through the Houses.  I sought yesterday to try to get a consensus view from the committee that it would waive PLS on the basis of urgency.  We could not get consensus on that.  A vote was requested, so we have brought the committee together today to vote on it.  I intend to put the question that the committee agrees to the request to waive PLS on the Residential Tenancies Bill 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021031600002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I want to set some context because this is the benefit of a public meeting.  We are politicians, so let us be clear that we are setting the narrative of what has happened.  We were contacted at the weekend regarding a request from the Minister, through the Business Committee, to waive the pre-legislative scrutiny, as the Chairman rightly said.  We met yesterday.  I thank the Department officials for attending the meeting and facilitating us as we facilitated them.  It was a two-way process of engagement on the matter.  I was reasonably happy to support the waiving of the PLS based on the urgency and the issues set out at that meeting, as I indicated in an email I circulated to every member of the committee.  Members of the committee all received that email and, indeed, I got one or two automated receipts very early this morning.  <\/p> <p>  It is important we have this opportunity to put matters on the record.  I went into yesterday's meeting with a view to supporting the waiving of PLS and I indicated that.  Indeed, I wrote to the Minister indicating that and I received a receipt for that letter this morning.  However, when I listened to what was happening and was told there was documentation that could not be circulated, and we were expected to make a decision based on limited information, rather than all the information, I was concerned.  At the end of the day, this is the joint Oireachtas committee that deals with these matters.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is an important aspect of our work.  It is not to be disloyal to anyone or to be in any way vexatious.  I support the Minister in the majority of what he is attempting to do.  I am particularly supportive of this issue, but we have to be respected for challenging and questioning the system.  That is what politics is about and it is why this is a cross-party joint Oireachtas committee.<\/p> <p>  It is simply not good enough to have a vote without the public knowing the narrative around this issue.  We got late notice.  The Minister thinks this is important, as I do.  A number of members, including Senator Fitzpatrick, suggested we might even have PLS today.  I am all on for that and suggested, as a number of members did, that we could have PLS this week.  A number of members of the committee are available this week.  We know it is serious but we believe it needs to be scrutinised.  That is the job of every politician, particularly the Opposition.  I want to put the record straight.  I recognise the seriousness of this issue, the importance of protecting tenants and landlords, the challenges around Covid and all the issues that surround this legislation.  However, we must remember we have limited time.  We are trying to facilitate everyone, and other members will speak about this.  I want to support the Minister and I am prepared to sit this week to deal with this issue.  If other members cannot do so, I respect that.  I also respect there is a report to be done.  However, we could have some sort of constructive PLS this week, and the Minister needs to be assured of that.  His officials will be listening in.  There is a willingness and commitment but there is no commitment to waive PLS.  I want to put that on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021031600002#A00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I agree with much of what he said.  It is my experience of this committee, in the eight months it has been together, that it has taken pre-legislative scrutiny very seriously.  Members have applied themselves to it very diligently.  We have produced a number of reports and there are further reports in train at the moment.  There is much more legislation coming towards us.  The committee holds pre-legislative scrutiny in high regard.  It is something we should always try to do and I have always tried to facilitate it.  We have done it well and in a collaborative and collegiate manner up to this point.<\/p> <p>  That is not the question today.  The question is whether we agree to waive PLS on this particular Bill because of the time constraints around it.  This Bill is seriously time constrained and there is urgency about it.  There is a real possibility that the legislation and current protections we have in place to protect people from evictions and rent increases could expire before we introduce this new legislation.  As Chair, it is my job to try and direct this committee.  I am mindful of the workload, St. Patrick's Day, Easter and the fact the Minister wishes to introduce this next Thursday in the D&aacute;il, which will give every Member an opportunity to participate in the debate.  I support PLS but I have to take a responsible and sensible approach as well.  If we go down the route of PLS, we will not be able to carry it out in a timeframe that will allow this legislation to be introduced and in place to protect tenants before it expires on 12 April.  That is the vote we will take today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021031600002#A00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee secretariat for facilitating this meeting at short notice.  I want to make a couple of remarks.  I accept members will not want to delay the meeting because we went through much of the detail on this matter yesterday.  We are in an unacceptable situation.  The Minister has known for some time that the April deadline was approaching, but instead of putting in place a proper plan to allow his officials and this committee to do our work properly, at the last minute - this is not the first time this has happened - officials have been given an impossible job of trying to draft legislation at very short notice and the committee essentially is being put in the position of having a Hobson's choice of waiving the important function of pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, which is not about being for or against legislation but about scrutinising it to ensure it does what we are told it is intended to do, or arguing for PLS and being accused of delaying the passage of the legislation.  This is the third time this has happened.  In respect of a previous piece of legislation the PLS request from this committee was bypassed and a relatively archaic and unknown procedure was used to get it onto the Schedule of the Seanad.  We were also denied pre-legislative scrutiny on the Land Development Agency Bill 2021, which is substantial legislation which all of us, in particular my colleagues and I, would have benefited from.<\/p> <p>  I do not think we can just let this pass.  While this is short legislation, we still have not had sight of it.  It was only because a number of members, including the Chairman, took issue yesterday with the fact that we were not being shown the draft of the Bill that it was shared on screen during the briefing.  There are several pages to this Bill which we have not seen or had a proper opportunity to scrutinise, including a general scheme of the Bill.  That has never happened in my time in the Oireachtas.  While I commend the officials on the detail of their briefing - I do not in any way criticise them - this is wholly unsatisfactory.<\/p> <p>  I want to make two points on the Bill because it is important that the public understand what it does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021031600002#B00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to be brief because the agenda item today is a vote on whether we waive PLS and not to debate the Bill.

I am not debating the Bill; I just want to make two comments on it.  I will debate the Bill when it comes to the House next week, if that is the outcome of today's vote.<\/p> <p>  There is a proposal that for those tenants who are in arrears because of Covid-19 income loss and who currently have protection of notice to quit or rent increase that if and when the 5 km restriction is lifted they would continue to have that protection until July.  The big question is why it is only being extended to July.  Given most of those workers will not be back to work this year, why is it not being extended beyond July?  We have not had an opportunity to scrutinise with the officials why that date, arbitrary as it is, was chosen as opposed to any other date.<\/p> <p>  Section 2 of the Bill removes a vital protection from all other renters who are in rent arrears.  The effect of the passage of this Bill would be that they would lose that protection and notices to quit could ensue.  I am not so sure why renters, whom we have been protecting until now, would lose that protection.  It makes no sense to me.  I proposed a compromise yesterday, which I want to put back on the table today.  Given the need to continue the protections for the group of renters - approximately 700 of them - under section 1, I ask that the committee would agree to allow that section of the Bill to proceed but that we would ask the Minister to withdraw section 2 because there is not the same time urgency in regard to that section and come back to it through proper pre-legislative scrutiny.  That would allow us to provide the protections that are urgently needed if the level 5, 5 km restriction is lifted in April and that albeit small group of renters who are benefiting from it would get it for another couple of months.  It would allow the committee to scrutinise why the Minister is proposing to remove a protection from all other categories of renters who are in rent arrears when the purpose of that does not make sense at this time.  I am willing to compromise on this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021031600002#B00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021031600002#B00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I ask the Chairman to allow me to finish.

In terms of rushing it, I do not mean to rush Deputy &Oacute; Broin; I try to give everybody time, but I try to keep the meeting relevant to the issue on the agenda.  My view on rushing the legislation is that if we were to go down the route of pre-legislative scrutiny, we would end up with such a tight timeframe it would not be possible to allow for timely debate of all Stages of the Bill or for every Member of the Oireachtas to participate or, at least, have the option to participate in that debate, to table amendments and to discuss the various Stages of the Bill as it progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The next speaker is Senator Mary Fitzpatrick, followed by Deputies O'Donoghue, McAuliffe and Cian O'Callaghan.

To give him an indication of how seriously we take the scrutiny of legislation, as well as the workload of the committee, which gives us a good understanding of the timeframes involved in pre-legislative scrutiny, Committee Stage of the Land Development Agency Bill will shortly be arriving on our desk.  That is really important legislation to provide affordable and cost-rental housing throughout the country.  We have the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the affordable housing Bill, into which we put much time and effort and to which Deputy Gould made a valuable contribution.  The secretariat is working on that report this week and it is my intention that we will be able to scrutinise and consider it next week and see if we can amend it.  We also have pre-legislative scrutiny of the electoral reform Bill and the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill, as well as Private Members' Bills which we are trying to accommodate.

There are potential policy implications in the context of the eviction ban being lifted in conjunction with the lifting of the 5 km restriction.  We have the opportunity to try to address the issues that have arisen in family homelessness.  The majority of people entering family homelessness have come from the private rented sector.  As the committee discussed yesterday, when the 5 km restriction is limited, those people will again be left to the ravages of the market.  The proposal that has been put before the committee involves a simple extension for people who have registered and been in arrears.  As we discussed yesterday, I do not think the numbers who have registered reflect the numbers who are either in arrears or potentially at risk of homelessness.  I think there are much wider policy implications involved, rather than the Government line that this is simply about extending the protections from August until July.  We can pretend that we are doing something while not actually doing it.  I think we need to look at the wider issue of evictions, the implications of the pandemic in that regard and how we address the issue of families entering homelessness.

I hope that after our presentation, the committee will recognise the urgency of the situation facing the post office network.  The Irish Postmasters' Union has been in existence since the foundation of the State and has continued to represent the vast majority of postmasters since then.  We will hopefully be celebrating our centenary conference next year.  Notwithstanding the difficulties we face, we appreciate the opportunity to present our case.<\/p> <p>  We ask the committee to express to the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet the urgency and benefit of supporting the network with the financial support recommended by the business advisers Grant Thornton in its review of the economic contribution and financial sustainability of the Irish post office network published last September.  The investment recommended by Grant Thornton would bring numerous benefits which I want to rehearse lest we forget them.<\/p> <p>  We are all in favour of communities and this would give medium-term certainty to communities that their local post office, designated an essential service during the Covid-19 pandemic, will remain at the heart of the community.  It will provide access for consumers to local services for all members in society, particularly the marginalised, financially excluded and most vulnerable who depend on the network for their services.  We provide a high level of customer service for all post office services, banking and cash transactions.  We deliver more than &euro;4.6 billion in cash transactions to social welfare customers without any transaction charges such as bank charges.<\/p> <p>  Research by citizens' advice in the UK found that the post office was one of the most important services in local communities ahead of the bank, library and pub.  The money the post offices hand out locally is spent locally thus sustaining and creating local jobs.  Grant Thornton reported the multiplier effect of this on the local economy was phase two of two, so the &euro;4.6 billion has a multiplier effect of two for local businesses.<\/p> <p>  As bank branches continue to close, the post office network is becoming more critical to small businesses to meet their daily cash and banking needs.  We facilitate social welfare and National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, services for Government but we can do much more.  We are a physical deterrent to social welfare fraud and provide greater security for businesses and the Government.  We can be the State on people's doorstep.<\/p> <p>  The post offices provide a reassuring sign of the presence of Government in communities.  From an environmental point of view, we can be a one-stop shop for services.  There is no need for multiple trips.  We can reduce the carbon footprint by keeping services local and provide a trusted avenue for the green agenda.<\/p> <p>  We provide social cohesion and connection and community identity.  We help sustain communities and help people with low literacy, the financially excluded and the most vulnerable.  We provide Government, tourist and community information and help with social isolation.  We are safe, secure and trusted and one of the last face to face institutions left.  <\/p> <p>  I will address some of the issues around community banking and the post office network and the concept of community banking as a panacea for the post office network.  Conceptually, we are in favour of community banking.  Given our country's history in relation to banking, who would not be in favour?  Notwithstanding macro-level banking issues for the banking industry in Ireland, we have to bear the following in mind when assessing the likely benefit for the post office network.  <\/p> <p>  The opportunities for banking in the post office are in direct competition with the increasing trend towards online services.  The components of banking are deposits, current accounts, loans, mortgages and across the counter transactions servicing these components.  An Post accepts deposits on behalf the NTMA for post office savings bank, Government investment product and prize bonds.  If a community bank were to replicate this activity, we do not see the benefit to the network in relation to transactions.  An Post operates a current account but the vast majority of transactions are conducted online.  Will a community bank be an exclusively offline offering?  An Post has personal loans and credit cards and plans for the introduction of SME loans.<\/p> <p>  Mortgage lending is the other lending and an example best illustrates the point.  For one mortgage for every post office in Ireland there is a capital requirement of &euro;230 million, taking a round figure of 1,000 post offices.  The average mortgage in 2020 was &euro;230,000, so one mortgage per year for every post office requires a capital requirement of &euro;230 million.  <\/p> <p>  If every post office in Ireland has one mortgage per month, there is a capital requirement of &euro;2.7 billion.  That is 12,000 mortgages at &euro;230,000 per mortgage.  Some 12,000 mortgages are 33% of all mortgages issues in Ireland last year.  I am not sure when a community bank or any bank can get to 33% market share but this is an illustration of the capital requirement and the challenge faced in terms of mortgage lending as a panacea for post offices.<\/p> <p>  I do not propose that customers attend the post offices to withdraw their cash and us getting the benefit of them lodging the amount they withdraw to pay the mortgage.  One would expect those transactions would continue online.  <\/p> <p> We carry out identity verification for money laundering purposes which we are not paid for.  It is one of the things we have asked be recompensed in a public service obligation, PSO.<\/p> <p>  The network provides across the counter agency banking services for some commercial banks.  This will increase with the recent announcement from Bank of Ireland which we welcome.  Having said that, transactions across the counter generated by a community bank have to dilute or replace the transactions we currently do.  We cannot see how a community bank, which we are conceptually in favour of, would generate enough business aside from replicating what we currently do.  We do not see it as a panacea for the post office network whatever about it being a panacea for the banking system in Ireland.<\/p> <p>   What does community banking do to the existing community bank?  The credit union already provides a role for community banking in Ireland.  Will the new community bank kill the credit union?  The concept of community banking was the subject of a Government study in 2017 and a report of more than 200 pages was produced.<\/p><p>There was also a subsequent independent study carried out by Indecon and commissioned by the Department of Finance in 2019.  None of the reports found that the proposals had merit.  The pilot scheme proposed before the Indecon report did not even include post offices.<br\/><br\/>We are concerned that the pursuit of banking as a solution for the network will prove to be a distraction from the real issues and we suggest that there is much more merit in pursuing more tangible services.  This includes ensuring that when the pandemic unemployment payments revert to jobseeker's payments they are mandated for collection through post offices or, as Grant Thornton proposed, establishing the network as the State on one's doorstep, and ensuring that communities have the option to access all government services through the network<br\/><br\/>I remind members of what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said in the D&aacute;il debate, no less than three or four months ago, on 21 October 2020.<\/p><blockquote>\tWe have a choice here.  One of the problems I have noted in my time in this House is that there are certain issues or topics for which every single Deputy will declare support, for the sake of the common good, with post offices and credit unions being two examples but when it comes to action and putting money where our mouths are, this Chamber has let down those organisations for generations.  Rather than have everybody from all sides of the House saying nice things about the post office network, can we actually support this motion and make sure that there is money to pay for the continued existence of the network?  <\/blockquote><p>Why the urgency now?  We agreed transformation payments with An Post in 2018 on the assumption that by 2021, new government services would be made available through the network, but none of these materialised.  The challenge we now face relates to the delay in providing these new government services which were promised to us in 2018, but that are only now being seriously examined, following an announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to establish a new interdepartmental group to examine directing more business to the post office network.<br\/><br\/>It is too late for this.  The network is facing a cliff edge at the end of June.  Decisions must be made, and actions must be taken, before then.  The Grant Thornton report warned of unrestrained post office closures after June 2021.  Its analysis recommended an annual public service obligation, PSO, payment of &euro;17 million, which, it is stated, would represent value for money for the State and provide a return of between &euro;334 million and &euro;776  million.  The lower end of that estimate by Grant Thornton is 20 times the investment.  <br\/><br\/>Currently, we serve 1.3 million customers; carry out 30 million social welfare transactions per annum; put &euro;4.6 billion in cash payments into the local economy without any bank charges, which has a multiplier of two, as I said; act as a deterrent to fraud; and employ 1,409 full-time equivalent staff.  <br\/><br\/>The IPU believes that the PSO should be in the form of an annual government retainer payment to be put in place from this summer with a commitment among all parties - the Government, An Post and postmasters - to expand the range of government services provided.  Postmasters are ready, willing and able to provide many additional services with immediate effect.  These have already been identified in previous reports produced by Mr. Bobby Kerr in 2016 and by An Post, the Government and the IPU in 2018, and include motor tax; licence renewals; registrations; identity verification, which we currently do unpaid; community information; and IT and office hub services, etc.  Independent research carried out by RED C last year found that 86% of people supported the Government providing financial support to keep their post office open and 86% of people wanted more State services available at their post office.<br\/><br\/>The day of reckoning has arrived for the post office network and it is now about actions and not platitudes.  The Government needs to act quickly and decisively to keep post offices open by ensuring a financial intervention is put in place before the end of June this year.  If it is not going to do so, it should tell us so that postmasters can make up their minds on whether they will continue in business providing the service which everybody says that they want, but which nobody is prepared to pay for.  Political backbone is needed to make a decision.  We ask the committee to provide that political backbone.  In comparison with the money that has gone into the banks, the investment in the post office network is minuscule.  There is a return of between &euro;334 million and &euro;776 million.  If no action is taken, the network will decline and disappear and people will wonder what happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021031600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned O'Hara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The committee is very supportive of the post office.

I have also been the head of research for the post office section of the Public Banking Forum of Ireland since 2015.  I have been the city postmaster for over 20 years.<\/p> <p>  The current pandemic crisis has brought to the fore our core values, the essence of our community and what services the State must provide when all life is stripped back to the very basics.  The post office network has been proven to be essential to our very existence.  During the lockdown, the post office network provided essential services.  It was one of the few State-owned assets that kept money circulating and local economies going.  We can no longer ignore or pay lip service to the realities of the financial gravity in which the network will soon find itself.<\/p> <p>  It is incumbent on the Government to implement a sustainability plan.  It should implement the Private Members' motion passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in November 2016 which sets out an action plan enabling the sustainability of the network.  A tight timeframe for implementation is a priority.  There must be a focus on new products, capital investment and government services for the network.  It is crucial that there is a five-year holding plan and that there will be no more downward revisions of post office incomes.  Otherwise, there will be no network to salvage.<\/p> <p>  Community banking must be re-investigated and developed as a survival option in light of the global economic depression.  The New Zealand and German community banking models must be considered.  This can be part of the overall recovery of small business and local communities, post Covid-19.  The community and social value of the network, so visibly present during the pandemic, must be recognised as a separate asset to the State, must be protected by the State and must hold a separate currency for the network when tendering for business.<\/p> <p>  Currently, the Government strategy is to reduce budget deficits and open competition for national contracts.  The Department of Social Protection is working towards the e-transfer of all social welfare payments, the reduction or elimination of cash transactions, open competition for contracts and reduced transaction fees for social welfare payments.  The post office is not really a concern.<\/p> <p>  Postmasters would like to see the introduction of an An Post-provided sole bank account for social welfare payments.  As we have said, An Post and banking is certainly an area that needs to be addressed.  Investment in facilitating this banking through the post office needs to be looked at.  All Departments can pay through the post office.  Overall, we are asking for the sustainability of the post office to be delivered.<\/p> <p>  The key to the sustainability of the post office network is for An Post to be the sole provider of bank accounts and to facilitate the Department of Social Protection's strategy to move to e-payments.  Users' accounts must be linked to the post office, thus maintaining services in the community and facilitating the customer locally, while also controlling potential fraud.<\/p> <p>  An Post is partly working under the agency banking model.  A State community banking model would be more sustainable, provide funding for local communities and also provide welfare bank accounts to facilitate social welfare payments.  The provision of banking through the post office network will require investment.  Currently, the National Treasury Management Agency has over &euro;20 billion in deposits.  These should be incentivised for investment in public banking.  <\/p> <p>  Postmasters believe that many other financial and administrative transactions between State Departments and service users can be put through the post office network.  An example of that is motor tax.  This was identified by Grant Thornton, the joint Oireachtas committee and the post office network group.<\/p> <p>  The post office network is a key State institution.<\/p><p>Government policy in its current form is detrimental to that.  A healthier vision for our society is one that includes tried and trusted institutions such as An Post and has a progressive vision for them.  An Post and postmasters are facilitative, forward-thinking and open for business.  We believe we can work in conjunction with the Government to achieve budget targets and technology enhancements in the provision of service.  If that is not done, there may be difficulty in terms of the issuing of social protection payments through post offices to customers on a cash concept.  As the committee is aware, we are moving towards a cashless society.  This matter urgently needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> In the context of the sustainability of post offices, I believe it is required that the current social welfare contract be reviewed each year.  That income is currently dropping by 3.2%, which will diminish the viability of post offices.  Post offices will not survive on cash transactions alone in light of the Government policy to move to electronic transfers.  This will be detrimental to stakeholders including An Post, postmasters, customers and communities.  As a result of the transition to a cashless society, the current model will not survive without constructive Government action.  <\/p><p> On tendering, the tendering process does not take into account the unique selling point of the post office network.  Post offices are not competitive under economic tenders but the post office network provides a valuable service in terms of a social and economic value system.  Post offices are among the last Government agencies operating in communities.  During Covid, post offices were the only example of a Government agency trading in towns and villages.  Is the Government going to let that go?<\/p><p> I refer to the S52 contract.  The current situation is that there are approximately 300 offices.  It involves a scaled payment review every three years based on transactions.  Their income is dropping significantly, by between 25% and 30%, due to social welfare payments moving online.  The current time bomb relates to the new contract signed by approximately 600 postmasters in July 2018.  Under that agreement, their salaries will be subsidised until June 2021.  Payments are based on transactions.  Post offices are facing a 25% decline in transactions due to Covid and social welfare payments moving online.<\/p><p> On the issue of Government intervention, temporary Government subvention is acceptable and necessary until a long-term solution is found.  It needs to be repayable and it would be best if it is short term.  I refer to the Grant Thornton report published in 2014 and the experience in the UK in terms of subvention.  The UK Government has used subvention-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021031600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Callaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. O'Callaghan to bring his remarks to a conclusion as we are very tight on time due to having to delay the start of the meeting.

It is clear that the maintenance of the post office network is at the core of the work they are doing.  Members who come from constituencies in which post offices have closed have seen the really negative impact the closures have had on the villages affected.  The closure of its post office effectively removes a core component of the village.  There is little doubt but that once the post office closes, other businesses cease to exist.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Hara and Mr. O'Callaghan referred to the situation during the pandemic and post pandemic and the need to take stock of where people are now at and the services they require.  There is no doubt that there is a difficulty in maintaining a post office purely based on transactions because people are doing far more online, but the fact is that some people still need the opportunity to do their transactions face to face.  It has always been my view that while that demand exists, it is incumbent on the State to provide the service.  Indeed, I think it can grow.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses that it cannot just be about transactions.  They offered views around whether the community banking model is the way forward.  As Mr. O'Hara indicated, it is not a panacea, although I am not sure that is necessarily how it is being portrayed.  It is another service that could be provided.  I have been around these Houses long enough to know that a significant amount of lip service has been paid by all political parties to the post office network.  There have been talks about services and another review of the banking opportunity in terms of community banking, etc.  However, the real crisis is now.  The money needs to be in place by June.  Unless it is in place, the network will continue to diminish and we will see the demise of many more post offices.  The only way to proceed for now is to make a very clear demand of the Government that a public service obligation be put in place as a first measure in order to prevent the closure of any more post offices.  Such action must include the post office in Broadford, County Clare, which closed recently.  <\/p> <p>  We need to stop the haemorrhage and draw a line under the closure of post offices.  Only then can we move to all the reviews and recommendations about the array of services that could be provided, including community banking, motor tax and other taxes and other State services.  To be honest, I am disappointed that we are into another round of reviews and looking at services and opportunities that have been thrashed out in various reports.  I must state on the record that I think it is being used yet again as a ruse to placate the postmasters who are rightly identifying a very serious problem.  <\/p> <p>  Do Mr. O'Hara and Mr. O'Callaghan agree that an immediate cash injection is needed to ensure we stem the loss of post offices?

The committee should then work with all involved, including postmasters, communities etc. to see how we can make that sustainable in the long term based on transaction activity and the roll-out of services.  Listening to some of the soundings from the Government, I am a little concerned that the two issues are being conflated.

There must not be any more post office closures  Those that have closed since Christmas, including the one in Broadford, must be reopened.  We must maintain the network at its current size and we must find the model to facilitate that.  In the first instance, funding must be issued by the Government to An Post to maintain it.

I previously served as a member of a local authority.  In my constituency, three local post offices closed in the most recent round of closures.  It would be really worth getting Grant Thornton or somebody else to do a longitudinal study to look at the impact of post office closures on communities and the social fabric, as well as on local businesses.

There is a cohort which has no access to computers or broadband.  There is certainly a cohort of people who are not competent enough to use computers.  There is also a cohort who are competent to use computers but who do not want to do so because of concerns over privacy and fraud.  There is a cohort who are competent to use online services but who do not want to do so for their own mental and social well-being in that they want to ensure they can interact with local services, particularly with their post office.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Government is abandoning these people.  We need the Government to realise that investment is needed quickly in the post office network.  It talks about investing in community development, rural rejuvenation and a town and village scheme.  Being able to attract people to such initiatives, one needs to be able to deliver to locally.  At present, however, the Government is withdrawing local services, particularly those relating to post offices, and is pulling back in the context of community development issues.  I hope we have a Minister with the backbone and business acumen to understand the value of a &euro;17 million investment that will deliver a social impact of between &euro;334 million and &euro;700 million.  The post office network delivers and distributes &euro;4.6 billion with a multiplier of two to local economies.  The committee needs to ask local businesses, the baker, the candlestick maker and the butcher, how important that money is to their survival.  This is important not just to the survival of local businesses but communities.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Rourke is correct that the post office is of significant value to communities.  I have been a working postmaster for the past 25 years.  I see the importance of the post office, not just to the most vulnerable and the marginal, but to all groups in society where they can interact in a trusted and secure environment with postal products, financial services and other services that we offer for the Government for free.  We deliver a huge amount of information and services on behalf of the Government.  The Government must realise the importance of the network and that the investment we are asking for is not that large.

I will make a few points at the outset.  My neck of the woods, Broadford in County Clare, has faced the devastation of a post office closure since the new year.  That is 190 years of history and service to the local community now shut, with Covid-19 used as an excuse.  This has been a feature of Covid-19.  We have vaccinations.  We talk about how society is being shut down but agencies and bodies have used Covid-19 as an excuse to shut things down.<\/p><p>Particular to the Broadford case, and it is important to mention it with our stakeholders here today, there seemed to be some kind of flaw in the model of contracts used by An Post.  It is very much the individual; it is not the community or to the overall service provided by the network.  In the Broadford case, the contractor and his family decided to retire from the service they provided and An Post seized on that opportunity to shut down the post office entirely.  Therefore, its contract is very much with an individual.  That is fine; that is how contract law works.  There is no chance of offering that contract to another individual, however.  It just shows that if one uses An Post's metrics of viability, many more post offices in the country could close if someone else decides to retire from the service.  An Post does not have a loyalty to the service overall.<\/p><p>I very much believe, and I have been pushing this within the Fianna F&aacute;il channels, that a public service obligation is the way forward.  I have been pointing to Dublin city where a grandiose vanity project - a &euro;22 million white-water rafting facility - is being planned and budgeted for by Dublin City Council.  It will cost &euro;17 million to keep our national post office network buoyant<i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>a public service obligation.<\/p><p>In a moment, I would like Mr. O'Hara from the Irish Postmasters' Union to outline whether he envisages that figure has crept up because it was suggested approximately three years ago and, obviously, there is inflation and further pressures on the service.  Has that figure crept up?  Is that sustainable year-on-year?  Does he believe that is likely to double, as some have suggested, or even treble within a decade?<\/p><p>I also believe there is a long-term need for other services to be provided in post offices.  Some people go there to receive their pension or social welfare payment or to drop in a package to be sent elsewhere around the world.  For most people, however, myself included, it is a case of going in for postage stamps, which in itself does not keep any post office afloat, alive or sustainable.  It will need far more in that regard, and in the medium to long-term we need to look at considerations, such as those put forward by Mr. O'Callaghan, for a community banking system similar to <i>Sparkassen <\/i>in Germany or the Kiwibank model in New Zealand.  I hope he will elaborate on that in a moment.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that a public service obligation will net an approximately twentyfold return for the Exchequer and the State.  If &euro;17 million is put in to keep it sustainable and buoyant then approximately &euro;334 million or thereabouts comes back.  It is a no-brainer.<\/p><p>I made the point to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and it needs to be a key recommendation of this committee, that he needs to intervene in those cases of post offices that were closed by stealth during Covid-19, in particular, including Broadford in County Clare.  We cannot use a magic wand and reopen every post office has been closed for decades.  That is just not viable.  It will never happen; it is fictional land.  As a committee, however, a key recommendation that I asked to be noted today is that any post office closed by stealth during Covid-19, including Broadford in County Clare, would reopen.<\/p><p>I will conclude by asking Mr. O'Hara to outline the public service obligation.  Where has it happened?  Where has it worked?  Is it likely to be higher?  Mr. O'Callaghan may then come in on the whole idea of community banking and outline how it has worked successfully in other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021031600002#F00100","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615852800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>To refer to Deputy Crowe's question, the Grant Thornton figures were calculated at the end of 2019.

We recognise there may be a fear in official circles that this could be an ever-expanding hole for the investment.  We, however, see that this should be subject to an annual or biannual review with regard to the services that are provided and the costs.  I would not expect anybody to sign a blank cheque.  Having said that, however, Grant Thornton said it will produce a return, and again, I am repeating myself, of &euro;324 million to &euro;776 million.

Why can we not be as large as Argos and be able to deliver to rural villages and other communities and open up the landscape to products?

We have reached a point where we must have a long think about how we want our towns to develop.  The main streets in our towns were home to many different types of shops 20 or 30 years ago, including hardware stores, drapery shops, butcher shops and so forth but they have all gradually disappeared.  They have either moved to the outskirts of towns or to shopping centres in large regional towns.  The local post office is almost the last one standing in terms of being an active community centre or hub on our main streets and in the centre of our towns.  The protection of post offices should not be and is not a nostalgic notion.  For as long as I have been interested in politics, post offices have always asked for responsibility for new services.  They have wanted to evolve, have asked for new services and for help to develop further and to sustain their position as a focal point in towns and communities.  They have always shown a desire to be flexible but for reasons that have always caused people to scratch their heads, we remain on this perpetual cliff edge which it seems we are actually going to reach at the end of June.  We have heard very worrying testimony from the witnesses.  We cannot continue to allow our post offices to wither on the vine.  Ultimately, we will end up with main streets that house only fast food outlets and bookies' shops.  That is essentially where we are going.  I represent a constituency in north Dublin which is a collection of towns and villages, the same as many other Deputies on this committee and beyond.  I have seen those communities wither and diminish in terms of what is offered in the centre of town, with only the post office still standing.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question on the recent Bank of Ireland announcement, by which I am quite intrigued.  Bank of Ireland has announced that it is going to close branches but its statement suggested that the post offices will take over that business, which is great because it will be a shot in the arm for the post offices.  I ask the witnesses to outline how much, if any, negotiation was done with the post offices in advance of or since the release of that statement.  I seek an explicit answer because the public was left with the perception that the post offices were in on this and were going to benefit from it but from what we have heard today, that could not be further from the truth.  The witnesses stated that up to 200 post offices are in imminent danger of shutting after 1 July.  While I am not seeking the details, do the witnesses have those listed in order of degree of risk?  The witnesses alluded to the fact the busiest offices are more at risk.

The short answer is that there has been no negotiation with postmasters but discussions are scheduled to take place next week.<\/p> <p>  On the number of closures, we conducted a review last year that was chaired by Mr. Turlough O'Donnell who is a senior counsel.  He asked me questions, in the way a senior counsel would , about the number of post offices that we expected to close and where they are located.  His interpretation of my answer was that there would be \"unrestrained closures\".  We do not know who, what or how many but we suspect it will be the offices that are closest to the economic margins.  We expect the post offices with the highest costs to close, including post offices in our cities.  One such office in Barrackton in Cork closed recently.  The postmaster was there for a long time and had done the State some service.  The post offices that are most on the margins of profitability are most at risk.  It is unlikely to be the smaller post offices and is more likely to be the bigger ones in the cities because they have higher costs, including rents and maintenance costs.

That has put post offices in a very difficult position in light of the level of public expectation, which is unfair and unwarranted.  No doubt postmasters will do everything they can to ensure that more services are provided in their post offices but we need to look seriously at community banking in this country.  We need to consider how post offices can engage with and be central to it.  This committee may need to communicate with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in this regard because we cannot keep operating in silos when there is obvious crossover.

We all know that for years our post offices have been allowed to wither and die.  Most post offices are under the threat of closure.  An Post is worn out from analysis.  It has been flogged to death by Government indecision.  An Post has been the subject of a mountain of reviews, assessments and evaluations and numerous reports.  Far-reaching recommendations to rescue the service are piled high without any implementation.  Successive governments have made positive noises and did absolutely nothing.<\/p> <p>  In considering all the data on record as to how to save the post offices, it beggars belief that last week the Government decided to establish yet another interdepartmental group to examine the feasibility of directing more government business to the post office network.  There is nothing new in this.  It has happened before.  It is another fudge.  Over many years, report after report declared in emphatic terms that An Post outlets were non-viable and faced closure.<\/p> <p>  The nub of the crisis is that under the current business model, activity does not generate sufficient turnover and income.  There is no profit to pay for the overheads.  Throughout Tipperary and the country, the majority of post offices remain on financial life support only through the selfless and tireless efforts of the local postmaster.  To survive in any business there must be products and services to meet the demands of the consumer.  The commercial offerings at An Post are outdated, outmoded and no longer desired by the consumer.  To add to this, An Post has been curtailed in its efforts to diversify and facilitate additional business through its network.  It has been suffocated by Government inaction.  It has been shut out by vested interests.<\/p> <p>  Back in 2016, I signed a motion with the independent group and it was unanimously agreed by the D&aacute;il.  I signed another motion with my colleagues in the Regional Group last October.  We set out a range of proposals to support An Post in the roll-out of new services and the delivery of a strategic plan to ensure its financial viability.  This included the provision of banking and financial services as part of a community banking model.  The motion was accepted by the Government and the D&aacute;il but there was no follow-through.  The Government must stop sidestepping the issue.  The Government must step in as a matter of urgency to create market conditions to allow An Post to grow and develop a wide range of services that would be supported by the community.  With Government support it is still possible to revitalise An Post.  An Post has the personnel, visibility, facilities and infrastructure to adapt and deliver a new sustainable model of business.  The time for pretence is long gone.  We need immediate and resolute action from the Government.<\/p> <p>  In the short term, the Government should make available an emergency fund and a fixed payment to avoid collapse.  The precedent is there if it follows the example set by the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, when he provided &euro;30 million.  The model to channel the funds to An Post exists.  If the Government wants An Post to survive and provide a public service, it must be willing to recognise the value of that public service and pay for it.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned.  I strongly support and am an advocate of a community bank.  Since Ulster Bank pulled out we have a duopoly with Bank of Ireland and AIB.  A lack of competition in the sector makes life very difficult, in particular for small businesses that are expected to take out a loan and give personal guarantees.  I would like the witnesses to comment on whether Bank of Ireland and AIB have effectively sidelined and spancelled An Post from participating in a future arrangement with a third banking force.  For the type of moneys that will return to the postmasters, and in general to An Post, I do not understand why they have gone in so blindly to this arrangement.  It suits the two banks perfectly well to have An Post under their arm.

There might be 100 or 200 post offices left.  Community banking also needs physical infrastructure and physical time to be able to deliver the service at a counter.  As it stands at present, the post office does not have this expertise.  It does not have the time needed to be able to deliver that expertise on the financial side.<\/p> <p>  An Post took the strategy, and in our view it was the right strategy, of trying to deliver more agency banking because it involves quick transactions that can give postmasters some sort of a return in the short term.  In the long term, what we are looking for is the Government to deliver retainer earnings for postmasters that will enable them to survive over the coming three, four or five years.  Our general secretary has already stated we are not looking for money to be put into a black hole.  We are quite prepared to look at a review in two years' time on how the new government services have fitted with the post office network, how they have been implemented and how they have fitted with the communities.  If it has not worked then, we may need to do something else.  In the meantime, we do not need to get distracted with a community bank because if we do get distracted with that community bank, the delivery of a public service obligation, PSO, or retained earnings will be lost very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021031600002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I appreciate that this is a long-term project.

The Chairman mentioned Castletroy post office.  I have fond memories of the wonderful community that was built around the post office in Castletroy.<\/p> <p>  It is not all about rural post offices.  Urban post offices are equally important.  For example, I am told the one in Mount Merrion is likely to close soon, which is outrageous.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the IPU on the constant work it does on behalf of its members.  I frequently have communications through the system and I compliment Mr. O'Hara and Mr. Martin, and those they work with, to ensure that we are constantly briefed.  <\/p> <p>  Listening to the discussion, I am wondering if it is only Opposition members who are at the committee because I am hearing nothing but support for the needs of the postmasters and the post office system in general.  There are Government Deputies and Senators here who have the wherewithal to bring their influence to bear on the needs of the post office system and, importantly, the role the post office plays in community life and has played since its inception.  The time for talking is gone.  I agree with Deputy Lowry.  It is time to put money into the system and get the post offices up and running.<\/p> <p>  I am deeply concerned about the duopoly that exists in the country.  The idea that we would have only two pillar banks, which can dictate the pace while we have a perfectly viable community base throughout the country in our post office system is wrong.  We need to develop that.<\/p> <p>  A number of questions have been raised with me and I believe Mr. O'Hara should have an opportunity to respond to them.  They do not sit easily with me.  They certainly do not portray the IPU, of which I am aware.  There is a suggestion that it was not fully behind the postmasters during the establishment of the new contract and that it induced members to sign up to a contract that effectively gagged them.  I find that difficult to believe but I believe Mr. O'Hara should have an opportunity to answer that question for the people who have raised it with me.<\/p> <p>  There is also some suggestion that Mr. O'Hara is not really behind the introduction of community banking.  Everything he has said today would suggest that he is 100% behind developing a community banking system and becoming a force in banking and community banking.  <\/p> <p>  I will conclude on that but I want to take the time to once again compliment Mr. O'Hara in particular for the way in which he represents the organisation and to wish his president, Mr. Martin, all the best.  I have been president of a union and it is not a comfortable place to be, very often, so I wish him well as he moves through that role.  I thank their communications people also for keeping us up to speed.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry I had to ask Mr. O'Hara those questions but if people are throwing these comments about it is important that he is given an opportunity to respond this morning.  That is it for the moment.  I may come back in with a supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021031600002#K00300","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615852800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>There is no problem at all.  I thank the Senator for his questions.  In respect of the contract negotiations we had in 2018, as I said, the IPU has represented postmasters for the past 100 years, since the beginning of the State.  It is a democratic organisation.  It is not a totalitarian organisation.  People have free speech and people were given the opportunity to speak.  When that contract was proposed it was accepted by more than 80% of the members.  I am the first to accept it was not the ideal contract but it was the best contract available at the time and the members agreed with that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to community banking, how could anybody oppose the concept of a community bank?  The president has iterated what I said.  It is not a panacea for the post office network.  There are many issues, particularly with regard to online banking and, in particular, the capital required.  To do the mortgages alone, for one mortgage per month for each post office there is a capital requirement of &euro;2.7 billion and one mortgage per month for each post office is 36% of the entire market.  The Senator spoke about Bank of Ireland and AIB.  I believe their combined market share for the mortgages is 53% or 54% so we are talking about creating something that is almost as big as either of those banks.  I cannot see that happening in the next three, four or five years.  <\/p> <p>  What we are looking for is a plan for the current business cycle of five to seven years and we are prepared to have that plan reviewed every one, two, three, four or five years if people are afraid that they are being asked to put money into a black hole.  <\/p> <p>  I said that what we wanted was Government services.  We have looked for Government services.  Government services have been recommended.  No one service is big enough to solve the scale of the problem.  I used the CAO applications as an example.  We currently do not do CAO applications.  I believe there are about 80,000 applications this year.  If 50% of those, which is 40,000, came to the post office network, we are talking about the equivalent of four transactions per annum.  The scale of the problem, therefore, is huge.  <\/p> <p>  There is a range of 15 or 20 services we can provide that can probably fit in that gap.  The biggest contributor we currently have is the Department of Social Protection and it is vital that those services are maintained for as long as possible.  As I said in my opening remarks, ensuring that when the pandemic unemployment payment reverts to jobseekers' payments they are mandated for collection through the post office network is something that might be of that scale.  If it was agreed that an interim payment was going to be made for a year or two, it will give the Government time to introduce those services and then reduce the subvention required.  It is not us who are saying that.  Grant Thornton, a third party independent business adviser, has said that.  We have taken professional advice.  <\/p> <p>  I have said that it should not have fallen to postmasters to produce that report.  One would have thought that a Government managing a national asset would have some projections in respect of what it expected from that asset over the next four or five years.  That is all we are asking for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021031600002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned O'Hara"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I have been contacted by a number of people regarding, for example, the credit unions.

That will limit their capacity to do anything.<\/p> <p>  I genuinely believe that we need to buffer the services being provided through the post office to provide an instant income for postmasters and their staff.

Through the history of the State, the post office has been paid transaction fees.

For instance, if a television licence was sold in one office, it was paid a different rate than another office would be.  Under the new arrangement, everybody is paid the same amount.  They are commercial rates.  Before this, the busier offices were paid lower rates and it made those uneconomic.  That was the crisis that we faced in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Bank of Ireland will close a significant part of its national branch network.  AIB has confirmed that it is undergoing major restructuring.

Bank branches will close in places such as Cobh, Youghal and Mitchelstown in my constituency.

It looks like there will be quite a significant change to how people interact with banking services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021031600002#L02300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615852800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy O'Connor since I believe he is the youngest Deputy in the D&aacute;il, and I am glad to see young people in it, because mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;, mar dhea.

I myself am a postmaster.  We have had the local office in my home town in Longford since 1972 and I have been postmaster since 2012.  As I am also a member of the Irish Postmasters Union, I welcome Mr. Martin and Mr. O'Hara in particular, who I know very well.  They are excellent representatives for our organisation.  A comment was made by Senator Craughwell and I say, as a postmaster at the time, that we were no way duped by the union.  Proposals were put in front of us that the union fought for with An Post etc., and everyone had a democratic decision to vote on it.  I wanted to make that clear.<\/p> <p>  I will give members an idea of being a postmaster.  I am slightly below the average mentioned earlier.  When we lost four postpersons a number of years ago, I took a 12.5% reduction in wages.  I took another 10% reduction in January and expect another 10%-plus in July, and further.  I run one of the smaller offices and that gives an idea of the type of cuts we have taken and will take.  Will I survive?  It is highly questionable.  I have a small shop with my business, which work together and which I moved into in 2007 to try to maintain both services.  However, I have seven part-time and full-time workers and it will be difficult, given the trajectory on which it is going and the earnings coming in.  <\/p> <p>  A number of Deputies have mentioned the word \"community\" and that is what it is all about.  It is about maintaining community and maintaining our towns and villages.  Going around every town and village in the country, there are empty properties everywhere.  If we do not invest in bringing people back to our towns and villages and if we do not have services there, people will not come to live there.  If we start losing our post office network, which in many towns will be the only financial services site left, other ancillary businesses will lose out and close because of the reduction in footfall that will occur.<\/p> <p>  Numerous members mentioned Bank of Ireland and AIB.  Looking back to the financial crash in 2009 and 2010, the State and the taxpayer bailed out both banks with substantial amounts of money.  Postbank was in its infancy, with 200,000 customers, and we were not subsidised or helped.  We had to shut down.  It was a bank that had no debt and customers with assets in their accounts and we were not bailed out or helped.  We are looking for help now.  One only has to look at the UK, where hundreds of closures happened through the beginning of the 2000s.  They are now spending hundreds of millions incentivising people to reopen offices in towns and village because those towns and villages died.  People were not going into them but were going into the main towns.<\/p> <p>  There is a huge opportunity here.  If we want to revitalise our towns and villages, the first thing we need to do is to maintain the post office service and the footfall going into towns and villages in order that we can then invest in bringing people back into living there.  We need to value the public service that the post office provides.  We are not looking for more money.  We just want to retain what we have, whether that is through a PSO or a retained earnings model, which was mentioned by Mr. Martin.  There might be issues with state aid rules in respect of a PSO but we are not seeking more money.  We want to maintain what we have and we are prepared to do more work for that.  That is what we ask and there is a huge opportunity here for us to reinvest in our rural towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Hara mentioned a figure of possibly 200 in the larger towns.  It think it will affect more.  I was at my union meeting recently and there could be considerably more people that would pull out because it will not be financially viable to stay in the business with the forthcoming reduction in pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021031600002#M01100","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1615852800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Is the Senator talking about that happening from 1 July?

That is what we face.  If we want to look after rural Ireland and our towns and villages, this is a small amount of money to invest.  Over the last two weeks, we had announcements from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, of probably &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million in the urban regeneration fund to invest in rural towns and villages.

We saw during the last financial crash that there was one respected institution, namely, our local post office.
