The review was based on the ISO 27001 standard for good practice in an information security management system. Overall, the review found that the Department&rsquo;s security posture was rated as good and above the standard which is usually seen in its sector. The review has also been used as the basis for an ongoing programme of further improvements to information security standards. Given the current threat levels and the significant resources which cyber criminals are prepared to use to hack into systems, it is important that we are not complacent in our approach to cyber security. Cyber security is an ongoing process in my Department, and we will continue to review the controls we have in place and implement new controls and protections where necessary and as new cyber defence technologies become available.<\/p><p>For operational and security reasons, we are advised by the NCSC not to disclose details of systems and processes which could in any way compromise cyber security measures in place in public bodies.

In addition to examining potential gains from removing factors affecting the free flow of goods, services and capital, consideration is given to areas such as labour mobility, government procurement, intellectual property rights, telecoms services and e-commerce.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the sustainability impact assessment found that the impacts to Canada and the European Union would not be significant.  The analysis also finds that CETA will lead to overall gains in welfare, real GDP, total exports and real wages in both Canada and the EU over the long-term.<\/p>  <p>  So, I am satisfied that CETA will not negatively impact, in aggregate, on Ireland's, or the EU's capacity to meet our Climate Change goals.  Moreover, our respective Climate Change Goals are enhanced when improved trade and investment flows for our people support an ambitious Trade and Sustainability, Green and Digital Transition, as applies in the EU and Canada. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300076#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Policy","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300076#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[29962\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300076#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the further supports that are being considered for SMEs to ensure viability into the future for these businesses on reopening and continuing trading due to the financial difficulties experienced by Covid-19 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>The Government announced a new Economic Recovery Plan this week, with &euro;4 billion of stimulus to fuel the economy and help businesses to recover and rebuild.

In exercising that competence at the World Trade Organisation or WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committee and Working Parties\/Groups, including on intellectual property, or IP.<\/p>  <p>  South Africa and India have amended their original proposal for a waiver by broadening the scope to cover all health products and technologies including diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, medical devices, personal protective equipment, their materials or components, and their methods and means of manufacture for the prevention, treatment or containment of COVID-19.  The revised proposal also provides that the waiver shall be in force for at least 3 years and the WTO General Council shall determine the date of termination of the waiver.<\/p>  <p>  The announcement by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai regarding the U.S. Government&rsquo;s support for a waiver of IP protections for COVID-19 vaccines, is significant. However, the statement acknowledged that reaching agreement on this at the WTO will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.<\/p>  <p>  The President of the EU Commission has responded to the U.S. announcement by indicating its readiness to discuss the U.S. proposal at the WTO. Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the U.S. announcement for a waiver on intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines can help to resolve the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The EU continues to be committed to an open and comprehensive dialogue with all WTO members to explore how the multilateral rules-based trading system can best support universal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.<\/p>  <p>  The EU believes that the WTO international agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (The TRIPS Agreement), allows countries the flexibility to respond to the concerns raised by proponents of the wavier.  Specifically, the TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing which is when a government permits an entity to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.<\/p>  <p>The EU also believes that voluntary licensing and the dissemination of technology and know-how is the more effective way of quickly scaling up manufacturing globally. To this end, at the EU level, the Commission has set-up a Task Force for Industrial Scale-up of COVID-19 vaccine production which aims to support the ramp-up of production capacity and resolve   supply chain bottlenecks.<\/p>  <p>  The EU considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global supply and access to COVID vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.<\/p>  <p>  The EU also considers that investment in global manufacturing capacity is key to supporting the global vaccination effort and the EU Commission is supporting a number of initiatives to achieve this, such as, the &euro;1 billion Team Europe initiative on manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300076#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Data","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300076#WRC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[29735\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300076#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the current level of import and export trade between Ireland and Israeli businesses in the occupied territories of Palestine, in financial terms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1506","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>The Central Statistics Office compiles statistical data in relation to Goods Exports and Imports.

Moreover, where such agreements cover investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.\u00a0The ICS in CETA reflects reforms promoted by the EU which address the concerns that had previously been raised by NGOs and others regarding the old Investor-State-Dispute-Settlement mechanism - or ISDS &ndash; on issues such as transparency, legitimacy and public interest.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can seek to sue the government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our Courts whether CETA exists or not.\u00a0 CETA simply provides an arbitration alternative - the ICS.\u00a0 Importantly, that alternative, unlike a challenge in the Courts, cannot find any act by Government to be ultra vires or unconstitutional - it is only concerned with redress for proven harm by discriminatory actions or unfair or inequitable treatment as set out in CETA.<\/p>  <p>  The ICS provides a single, consistent mechanism where investors, be they Canadian or European, can seek redress.\u00a0 However, under CETA the right of Member States (and Canada) to regulate for public policies (e.g. in health, environment, security) is fully preserved, and it is made clear that the Agreement does not imply an expectation that public policies will remain unchanged. \u00a0Further, an investor&rsquo;s loss of profits will not be sufficient grounds for making a claim against a Government. \u00a0Any claim must be based on discriminatory and unfair treatment.\u00a0 Investors will retain the option of utilising either national courts or the ICS but are precluded from using both, to avoid forum shopping.\u00a0 All documentation in a dispute will be publicly available including decisions and third parties such as NGOs will be able to participate.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, CETA also provides a forum for civil society advisory groups to submit opinions or make recommendations in relation to matters related to the Trade and Environment Chapter of CETA. \u00a0CETA further encourages inter-government cooperation on environmental related issues and cooperation in international forums.\u00a0 In this regard, the CETA civil society forum has met on three occasions to date, most recently on 8\/9 December 2020 where parties discussed the potential for future collaboration between Civil Society Organisations and the EU and Canada on issues such as Gender equality in access to trade opportunities, SMEs and Climate Action and the Paris Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, what ICS does is provide a reformed alternative for investors where they may be in dispute with a State, alleging discrimination or unfair treatment.\u00a0 On the other hand, any investor can always, to use the Deputy's term, be held \"accountable\" before different domestic or EU fora, as all investors in Ireland are subject to the same national and EU legal order and obligations, notwithstanding CETA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300077#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300077#WRD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[30237\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300077#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his Department has made representations to the Minister for Health in relation to mandatory hotel quarantine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>My Department is represented on the Expert Advisory Group on Travel which provides advice to the Chief Medical Officer in relation to the designation and de-designation of countries for the purpose of mandatory hotel quarantine as provided for in the Health Act, 1947.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also represented on the Senior Officials Group on COVID and International Travel which carried out the recent Review of Mandatory Quarantine Arrangements and International Travel which informed the Government decision-making process on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have engaged with the Department of Health in relation to arrangements for persons travelling from designated countries for the purpose of carrying out essential services.

many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. The use of digital platforms by IDA staff has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients and also in hosting E-Site visits with potential new investors.2020 figures are consequently a combination of &lsquo;in person&rsquo; visits and &lsquo;E-visits&rsquo;. details of which are set out below:<\/p><p>-\u00a0TThe table below sets out the details of the amount of funding expended by the IDA in each county in each of the past 5 years, as requested by the Deputy. Note that payments shown in the table relate to grants paid. \u00a0There are several reasons why certain counties might have registered a small or zero figure in any given year. The grant may be paid in a different year than approved. Grants are for specific projects and the life time of these is generally 3-5 years, so although a small or zero figure is shown it does not necessarily mean there was no activity. And finally the number of FDI companies in a particular county will affect the number\/amounts of grants paid in that county. <table>    <tr>       <th>County <\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>

As you will be aware, Minister McConalogue's Department is the lead Department for all animal welfare issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is kept appraised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the issue of pet theft. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, the theft of an animal carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment on conviction. If the animal was taken from a person's property the crime becomes burglary and attracts a potential maximum of up to 14 years imprisonment.  These are significant sentences by any measure.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act for the administration and management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including all operational policing decisions. This includes crime prevention initiatives and strategies. Neither I, nor the Minister, have a role in these independent functions and that is entirely correct. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to measures aimed at preventing such thefts, I am informed by the Garda authorities that information has been disseminated to the Crime Prevention Officers' Network countrywide specifically dealing with the topic of dog thefts. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety concurs with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing patrols throughout the country also act as a deterrent to mobile criminals and thereby help prevent criminal activity. Improved awareness of dog thefts among the community will ensure more vigilance within neighbourhood watch and community alert areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300079#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":302,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 118 to 120, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":304,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 121 to 125, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Probate Applications","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300080#WRG00250"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[29706\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300080#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the significant delays in processing applications in the Probate Office; the actions she is taking to address the matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Probate Office is an office of the High Court. Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in its functions. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided me with the following update on the Probate Office. <\/p>  <p>  County Registrars are responsible for the management of probate in District Probate Registries outside of Dublin and are independent in carrying out their functions. The Courts Service works closely with County Registrars to support their timely processing of applications. <\/p>  <p>  While there have been variations in the level of service that could be provided as a result of Covid-19 restrictions, I am assured that District Probate Registries continued to work at all times during the pandemic. As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of personal application interviews must be conducted in line with public health guidelines. As a result, the Courts Service advises that personal applications did have to be curtailed during Level 5 restrictions to ensure the safety of both the applicant and staff. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has confirmed that interviews for personal applications resumed in May and additional staff resources have been allocated in some locations to facilitate these interviews. <\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Probate Office accounts for over fifty per cent of all probate applications lodged in this jurisdiction, and the waiting time for solicitor applications is at its lowest point for many years. For applications that are correct, the waiting period is six weeks. In Cork, waiting times are 10-12 weeks for solicitors, and 14 weeks for personal applications compared to 10 weeks and 12 weeks respectively in November 2019.<\/p>  <p>  District Registries normally are small offices and I understand from the Courts Service that staff turnover can lead to temporary spikes in waiting times while vacancies are filled. However, the staff of the Probate Office are committed to clearing any backlogs and I am informed that personal application backlogs have reduced and waiting times have stabilised. I know that the Court Service is committed to continuing to resource this work to minimise waiting times as far as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service also advises that the manual Revenue affidavit was removed from the probate process and replaced with an online system, which went live last September.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300080#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":308,"content":"<p>Question No. 127 answered with Question No. 118.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300080#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[29972\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300080#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in the Macroom district at the end of April 2021; the way in which this compares with the end of April 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>The resources provided by government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation of &euro;1.88 billion in 2020 and of &euro;1.952 billion in 2021.

As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. <\/p>  <p>  As at 30 April 2021 there were 74 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Macroom District, which represents an increase of 10.4% since 2015.

My Department is in the final stages of developing an implementation plan which will set out changes to be made in all areas of civil justice, including litigation costs, case delays, and access to services and legal aid. Once completed, the implementation plan will be brought to Government and published. The extensive reforms proposed by former President Kelly will transform the experience of those seeking to access civil justice in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 has already brought greater transparency to how legal costs are charged. It obliges legal practitioners to provide more detailed information about legal costs to their clients. It has introduced statutory rules and limitations when advertising legal services, and enables legal services users to apply to the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator to have disputed legal costs adjudicated. Under the General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, which was approved by Cabinet this week, we are also facilitating the introduction of new legal partnerships, which will enable barristers and solicitors to jointly provide legal services for the first time, thereby offering a greater range of services and legal expertise to their clients.<\/p>  <p>  Building on that work, and the recommendations of the Kelly Review, the Justice Plan 2021 commits to commencing work to introduce new scales of legal costs which would be independently drawn up, in order to reduce legal costs and to provide greater certainty to the users of legal services in relation to cost. My Department has tendered for research bids to undertake an economic analysis of appropriate models and approaches.  <\/p>  <p>  A General Scheme of a Bill to create a specialist family court system, which is designed to help people get a quicker resolution of those most sensitive of family disputes, was published last year.  A public consultation has commenced on the first Family Justice Strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  For those who require direct State support to engage in litigation, especially family matters, my officials are currently working on the scope and nature of a review of the civil legal aid scheme. I intend to commence this review later in the year with a view to bringing forward proposals for reform.  Last Friday, I announced that the Legal Aid Board will no longer include the Housing Assistance Payment in their calculation of entitlement to civil legal aid.  This will have a positive impact for those who are of modest means and are in receipt of HAP or any other housing support measure provided by a Government Department or any other public body. <\/p>  <p>  My Department's Justice Plan 2021 also provides that a Mediation Council will be established and I expect this reform will support the ongoing development of the mediation profession as an accessible alternative to more costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, regulations for the use of Pre-Action Protocols in medical negligence cases are being finalised by Government &ndash; these reduce the costs of litigation by enabling parties to agree to how they will conduct their case between them.<\/p>  <p>  The range of actions I have outlined to the Deputy today have all been developed with the aim of reducing legal costs and enhancing citizen&rsquo;s experiences of accessing justice to resolve particular matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300080#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300080#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[27835\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300080#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strategy statement 2022-2024; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>The Garda Strategy Statement 2022- 2024 will set out An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s long-term operational priorities, as well as the key focus areas within the organisation, framed by the actions contained in <i>A Policing Service for our Future<\/i>, the Government's implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. <\/p><p>I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take account of a broad spectrum of views in the formulation of the Strategy Statement.

In particular, it is not considered appropriate to disclose information which might assist criminals to identify potential vulnerabilities in security arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  I can say that, over the last 7 years, my Department has made considerable enhancements to its ICT systems and services.  This includes migrating our technology infrastructure and completing a refresh of the major server and telecommunications components of the IT landscape.

A distinguished former Director of the Probation Service, Vivian Geiran, was engaged to prepare the report, which makes over 70 recommendations on short and long term responses to challenges the community faces. This includes measures around crime prevention, youth services, drug addiction, education, infrastructure and community development. The recommendations highlight the need for improved interagency cooperation in the administration and delivery of State services in Drogheda, as well as the need to resource public services or provide additional services in certain areas in particular.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scoping Report was published on 26 March last.

This Act ensures that our regulatory framework keeps pace with the increasing integration of financial flows in the internal market, the evolving trends, technological developments and the prevention of organised crime. In line with international standards adopted by FATF, and the EU's legislative framework, Ireland has developed a solid regulatory framework for preventing money laundering.  <\/p>  <p>  This Act strengthens existing legislation and contains a renewed focus on gatekeepers of financial systems. It ensures that there is increasing transparency by bringing further institutions within the scope of the Irish anti-money laundering regulatory framework and by combatting the use of new trends and technologies employed by criminals. <\/p>  <p>  Virtual assets have created new opportunities for money launderers, terrorist financiers and other criminals to launder their proceeds or finance their illicit activities. The ability to transact in virtual assets rapidly across borders allows criminals to move and store assets digitally, often outside the regulated financial system.  <\/p>  <p>  Virtual assets also allow for greater anonymity when compared to other more traditional financial services.   This anonymity can help to disguise the origin or destination of the assets, which can prevent virtual asset transactions from being adequately monitored, thus making it harder for reporting entities to identify suspicious activity.  In turn this creates a barrier to the detection and investigation of criminal activity utilising virtual assets by law enforcement agencies.<\/p>  <p>  It is these Money Laundering \/ Terrorist Financing risks that the Virtual Asset Service Provider registration and supervision regime created by the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021 is intended to mitigate.  Money Laundering \/ Terrorist Financing is continuously evolving, as criminals seek new ways to launder funds\/finance terrorism as more and more traditional avenues are closed off. <\/p>  <p>  However, this regime seeks to ensure that the &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo;, such as the legal profession, estate agents, accountancy bodies, who allow virtual assets to be moved, exchanged and stored, are subject to the same Anti Money Laundering and Countering Terrorist Financing obligations as banks and traditional financial service providers. In framing this regime, this legislation seeks to address our EU obligations, as well as the international obligations that arise from our membership of FATF.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act gives effect to EU Directive 2017\/1371 on the fight against fraud to the European Union&rsquo;s financial interests by means of criminal law. The Directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions with regard to combatting fraud and other illegal activities (corruption and money laundering) affecting the EU&rsquo;s financial interests.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan for 2021, the fight against organised crime stretches beyond our borders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with their international colleagues to break the networks of serious criminals and prevent them from inflicting misery in our communities.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly liaises and cooperates with their international policing and security partners, such as EUROPOL and INTERPOL. <\/p>  <p>  Of great importance in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is the role of the Financial Intelligence Unit in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is responsible for receiving suspicious transaction reports from designated persons and analysing them, so that it can be used to combat crime.<\/p>  <p>  International collaboration is also central to further developing our capacity to combat the exploitation of technology for cybercrime. As the Deputy may appreciate, cybercrime and cyber attacks know no borders and evolve at a rapid pace.  In the wake of the easing of travel restrictions across Europe, the recently published EU Strategy to tackle Organised Crime 2021-2025 and the 2022-2025 EU priorities for the fight against serious and organised crime through the European multi-disciplinary platform against criminal threats (EMPACT) are timely strategies as they set out the priorities, actions and targets to be achieved in the coming five years to put the EU on a stronger footing in the fight against organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  A number of commitments with regard to cyber security are included in the Programme for Government in order to take the necessary actions to protect Ireland against hacking, cybercrime, crypto-jacking, hacktivism, and cyber espionage. This includes building the capacity of the National Centre for Cyber Security, under the remit of my colleague, Minister Ryan, to protect the public and private sectors against cybercrime on foot of the capacity review currently underway. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is supporting the Centre through ongoing engagement at a senior level, as well as the secondment of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been significantly stepping up its dedicated resources in the cyber area in recent years, as is recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The Garda Commissioner established a dedicated National Bureau last summer, led by a Detective Chief Superintendent. The Bureau is expanding with planned increases of nearly 80 additional staff between this year and 2022, 25 of whom are already in place. This expansion will include recruitment of 20 civilian expert posts at engineer grade.  In addition, four regional cybercrime hubs in Galway, Cork, Mullingar and Wexford were established earlier this month. The bureau&rsquo;s own IT capability is also increasing with a new decryption suite procured earlier this year.  This work is also resourced through a team in the National Crime and Security Intelligence Service. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are liaising and co-operating with their international law enforcement partners &ndash; Interpol, Europol, the FBI and National Crime Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300081#WRH03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inquiry into the Death of Mr. Shane O'Farrell","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300081#WRH03850"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[27841\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300081#WRH03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she plans to establish an independent public enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of a person (details supplied) on 2 August 2011 and the roles of State agencies prior and subsequent to their death as previously agreed by D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.","asker":"1451","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>I would like to start by offering my own deepest sympathies to the parents and family of the late Shane O'Farrell.

Where such an application for judicial review is lodged, the Minister for Justice will typically be the respondent and will reserve the right to defend a lawfully made decision.  It will then be a matter for the courts to adjudicate on the lawfulness of the decision, which is the subject of the legal proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  The judicial review process is an important mechanism through which legal clarity and certainty can be brought to a particular immigration process or decision-making mechanism, and also through which important legal and administrative principles can be established, and reinforced, to guide future decision-making. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the international protection process, the statutory provisions in this area are well defined and are clearly set out in the International Protection Act 2015. Any person seeking international protection status will have all aspects of their case considered in detail before a decision is made.

Furthermore, the scheduling of individual court cases and the allocation of court business are matters for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. <\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Courts Service adopted a Modernisation Programme aimed at improving access to justice in a modern, digital Ireland.  This programme sets the agenda for reform over the coming years with a digital first user-centric approach at its core, and is overseen by a dedicated Modernisation Programme sub-committee of the Courts Service Board. As part of the initial phase of the programme, a framework is being developed which will track and measure progress throughout the programme&rsquo;s implementation.<\/p>  <p>  I particularly welcome the goal of the Courts Service, as set out in its recently published Corporate Strategic Plan 2021 &ndash; 2023, to maximise the use of digital technologies to provide an improved and user-centred service. <\/p>  <p>The Courts Service and the judiciary have adapted with innovation and speed during the pandemic and many of the practices introduced due to Covid-19, such as the increased use of video links and e-filing, point the way towards a Digital First future for the Courts Service. <\/p>  <p>  Remote court hearings have been an innovative feature of the response by the judiciary, County Registrars and the Courts Service to the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service recently announced a programme of courtroom technology expansion.

Since then, this number expanded to 65 last year, and will reach 104 courtrooms by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Between April 2020 and April 2021, a total of 4,917 remote court sessions were held. Over the same period, there were 16,995 Irish Prison Service remote video-link courtroom appearances by prisoners compared to 3,798 in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  This progress has been supported by the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring adequate resources for the courts and maintaining access to justice for all citizens.

The first phase of the restoration works will see ten of the 66 bays\/sections restored. <\/p><p>The Courts Service further advises me that the OPW is managing a competitive procurement process to select a contractor with the necessary expertise and skills to undertake the phase 1 restoration. An invitation to tender for the restoration of the initial ten sections issued earlier in the year with a closing date of 26 March 2021. I understand that responses received are being evaluated at present and it is expected that a contract will be awarded shortly. Funding has been allocated in 2021 to cover the anticipated cost of the phase 1 restoration of the initial ten sections. This initial work will inform how future phases will be undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300082#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300082#WRJ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[29966\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300082#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the report on familicide will be published.","asker":"1553","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>Domestic homicides are truly devastating events for families, for friends and for the wider communities affected.

The revised National Development Plan that the Government is currently developing is a further opportunity to deliver on this vision.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the development of a &lsquo;Town Centre First&rsquo; policy focused on regeneration of rural towns and villages, and my Department&rsquo;s Retail Forum developed a Framework for Town Centre Renewal which is a useful tool to assist Town Teams in how to improve footfall and customer experience in their towns. We are implementing a strategic approach to town centre regeneration, with the aim of utilising existing buildings and unused lands for new development and promoting residential occupancy in our rural towns and villages, using the National Planning Framework as our guide.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department published the National Remote Work Strategy in January 2021. The Strategy aims to ensure remote work is a permanent feature in our workplaces in a way that maximises economic, social, and environmental benefits across regions. We are aware that the impacts of remote work can be substantial and can fundamentally change the nature of where, how, when, and why we work.\u00a0Earlier this week\u00a0the Government launched 'ConnectedHubs.ie'. This shared remote working platform will offer a booking system for employees, entrepreneurs and enterprises. It will provide people with the opportunity to reserve facilities, including hot desks and meeting rooms, at hubs across Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Overseen by my Department, nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 are currently being developed by regional stakeholders which will identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities, and enable job creation across the regions.\u00a0 These plans reinforce and build on the core activities of the IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) and the wider range of State bodies involved in supporting regional enterprise development. Each Plan is overseen by a Regional Steering Committee chaired by a senior level businessperson. My Departmental colleagues, Minister Robert Troy and Minister Damien English are driving the delivery of the new Plans nationally. The new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 are expected to be completed in Quarter 3 this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has provided funding to assist regional enterprise development and jobs growth. For example, my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund and Border Fund have allocated over &euro;117 million across 79 enterprise strengthening projects in every region over a series of competitive calls since 2017 through Enterprise Ireland. These Funds are supporting significant collaborative and innovative regional projects that, when complete, will provide a timely impetus to job creation in regional locations.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at employment growth, almost two thirds of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2020 were in regions outside of Dublin while IDA Ireland created 10,082 new jobs outside of Dublin.

Since the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into force, there has been some short-term disruption arising from the new requirements around customs and SPS checks and controls. Businesses are however gradually adjusting to the new trading realities, finding alternative supply chains and are being encouraged to find new markets for their products. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent CSO statistical data release indicates that the value of goods exports to Great Britain in the first quarter of 2021 was &euro;3,033 million, a decrease of &euro;82 million (-3%) on the first quarter of 2020. However, exports to Great Britain increased by &euro;139 million (+13%) to &euro;1,216 million in March 2021 compared with March 2020. Exports to Great Britain accounted for 8% of total exports. The value of goods imports from Great Britain for January to March 2021 was &euro;2,204 million, a decrease of &euro;2,002 million (-48%) compared with January to March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It is too early, based on statistics for the first quarter of 2021, to get a real sense of the impact that Brexit will have on longer term trade flows as there are other contributory factors, not least COVID-19 that has also had a chilling economic effect. Analysis of trade flows over a longer period of time would be required to allow for sound conclusions to be drawn. <\/p>  <p>  Since January 2021, Enterprise Ireland has engaged with client companies through surveys and focus groups to understand the impacts for companies on the new trading relationship with the UK. Companies across all sectors identified common challenges such as the potential disruption from Import Checks which are set to begin in October; supplier issues and transport and logistics; and\u00a0 general competitiveness of businesses because Brexit &ndash; related customs procedures and added supply chain costs have increased the costs to businesses.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the new business challenges, the UK continues to be a strategic market of importance for Irish companies. A recent survey of Enterprise Ireland clients currently operating in the UK market reported that 89 percent see future opportunities in the UK while 83 percent report that their strategy is to grow exports to the UK.<\/p>  <p>  While Enterprise Ireland clients are continuing to diversify their export markets, the UK market remains the largest export market for Enterprise Ireland clients. In 2019, Enterprise Ireland clients reported &euro;7.9 billion in exports to the UK, representing 31 per cent of total client exports. \u00a0Enterprise Ireland remains committed to working with client companies to assist them sustain and grow their business, both in the UK, and through market diversification. This will be delivered through a comprehensive programme of funding, advice and in-market supports to get customs ready, remain competitive in the UK and identify future growth opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to ensuring that the most Brexit impacted sectors of the economy will be supported and assisted. The Deputy will be aware that economic analysis carried out in 2018, updated in January 2020, on the economic impacts of Brexit on the Irish economy, identified the Agri-Food sector as the one most likely to be most seriously impacted. In that respect, the &euro;100 million Capital Investment Scheme for the Processing and Marketing of Agricultural Products, managed by Enterprise Ireland, is just one of the ways the Government is helping the Agri-Food sector manage the fallout from Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve and the proposed significant allocation of funding to Ireland under this fund is strong recognition of the fact that Ireland is one of the most impacted Member States by Brexit. The fund will be used to mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit for the most impacted sectors in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300083#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300083#WRK03250"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[8972\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300083#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that Ireland remains attractive as a location for foreign direct investment; if there has been any fluctuation in the position of Ireland in that regard in recent months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>COVID-19 has presented challenges to our ongoing efforts to sustain and grow foreign direct investment in Ireland. The introduction of travel restrictions has disrupted the way in which IDA Ireland engages with investors, resulting in fewer site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.  Nevertheless, IDA Ireland's results for 2020 demonstrated the ongoing resilience of our FDI base. IDA Ireland secured 246 investments in 2020, 128 of which were outside Dublin. 95 new name companies invested in Ireland for the first time. <\/p>  <p>  The second significant challenge which we have faced is Brexit. IDA Ireland has been working hard with its client base to help mitigate Brexit-related risks that could impact on foreign direct investment in Ireland.  The Agency has consistently sought out opportunities to attract further Brexit-related investment to Ireland, resulting in 95 Brexit-related investments with an associated jobs potential of 5,900. Furthermore, IDA Ireland has taken steps to diversify its source markets for foreign direct investment, restructuring its European operations to treat the UK as a separate market. It will also deploy additional resources in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.<\/p>  <p>  We recognise that the global competition for FDI is intensifying and that we will have to fight, harder than ever before, for new investment projects.

Loans of up to &euro;250,000 are unsecured.\u00a0 As a result of the high level of the State guarantee, loans are being provided at interest rates lower than the current market rate for similar loans.<\/p>  <p>  - The COVID-19 Business Loan provides up to &euro;25,000 to eligible micro-enterprises through Microfinance Ireland with zero repayments and zero interest for the first six months and the equivalent of an additional six months interest-free, subject to certain terms and conditions. \u00a0Microfinance Ireland also provides start-up business loans and loans for established businesses for up to &euro;25,000 with interest rates of between 6.8% and 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  - The COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme makes lending available from participating lenders to eligible businesses. Loans available under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million and are for terms of up to three years. Loans are offered at favourable terms, including a maximum interest rate of 4% and no security on loans of up to &euro;500,000.<\/p>  <p>  - The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme is a new scheme which is being introduced in recognition of the additional effects of COVID-19 on Brexit impacted businesses. The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme will provide loans with terms of up to six years with loans to be made available for liquidity\/working capital and investment purposes. Loans will range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available unsecured. The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme will be launched in summer 2021 and will replace the existing Brexit Loan Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  While the State provides funding or guarantees on these loans, the Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process in relation to loans offered under these schemes, which is fully delegated to the participating lenders.<\/p>  <p>  Where an applicant has had a loan application refused, they may wish to appeal the decision through the individual lender&rsquo;s appeals system.\u00a0An appeal to the Credit Review Office (CRO) is a further option if the lender is a participating bank. The CRO helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the CRO and the bank.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the deputy that officials from my Department are in regular contact with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Microfinance Ireland, the operators of these schemes, to ensure the effective implementation of these schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":539,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[30343\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the scope for businesses (details supplied) that do not meet the staffing criteria to qualify for the online retail scheme to avail of the scheme; if there is a dispensation for such businesses; if there are alternative supports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1484","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":540,"content":"<p>Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term.\u00a0<\/p><p>The COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme - a competitive scheme, administered on my Department's behalf by Enterprise Ireland - is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector who have already started an online journey, to further enhance and strengthen their online presence, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department proposed the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability.

Based on this trend it is likely that the number of individuals from the construction sector claiming PUP will continue to decline over the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has been an important measure that has helped maintain employment in the sector during the pandemic.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As was the case with PUP, the number of employees in the construction sector that were supported by the EWSS increased sharply in January 2021.\u00a0This vital scheme continues to provide valuable financial assistance to employers and has helped ensure employees remain within the sector, with almost 37,600 employees participating in April 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Data","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[30414\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL03900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which trade opportunities continue to open up for Ireland following the double impact of Brexit and Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":558,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[30416\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL04000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which Ireland&rsquo;s trade with EU countries has increased sufficiently to compensate for any losses arising from Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[30417\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL04100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the degree to which trade volumes are set to grow in the months ahead with particular reference to the need to achieve an early post-Covid-19 recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[30418\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL04200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which new trade prospects have become available to compensate for losses arising from Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213, 215, 216 and 217 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, 2020 export performance and the outlook for 2021 exports to the UK, Eurozone and rest of the world continues to be significantly impacted by both Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Brexit has fundamentally changed the trading relationship between Ireland and the UK and will continue to impact that trading relationship.<\/p>  <p>  The long-term response to Brexit is for companies across all sectors to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more international markets.\u00a0 My Department&rsquo;s 2021 budget allocation of &euro;1.13bn represents an increase of &euro;154 million or 15.9% on the 2020 allocation. This is in addition to &euro;100 million earmarked from the Recovery Fund for Brexit. This is a record allocation and will significantly bolster the capability of our enterprise and regulatory agencies to help businesses examine their Brexit exposure, seek advice, avail of customs training and make plans to protect their business.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for 2021 is to sustain Irish jobs and exports and increase the resilience of the enterprise base with a view to ensuring global exports retain their pre-pandemic, pre-Brexit value of &euro;25.6 bn. The agency&rsquo;s focus will be on supporting clients to adapt and succeed in a post-Brexit environment, sustaining existing export sales and accelerating the diversification of Irish exports. While the UK will remain a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export market in markets beyond the UK will continue to be a priority.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges posed by the double impact of both Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s preliminary statistical data for 2020 shows that goods exports were valued at &euro;160,814 million in 2020, the highest total on record. This is an increase of &euro;8,280 million (+5%) over 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It is too early, based on statistics for the first quarter of 2021, to get a real sense of the impact that Brexit will have on longer term trade flows as there are other contributory factors, not least COVID-19 that has also had a chilling economic effect. Analysis of trade flows over a longer period of time would be required to allow for sound conclusions to be drawn about future trade volumes.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success in growing exports has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets will be essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL04400"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[30415\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300084#WRL04500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which industry has anticipated and prepared for a full return to work in the aftermath of Covid-19; the issues presenting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":564,"content":"<p>The successful vaccination programme is now allowing for a progressive re-opening of the economy.

Applications are currently being assessed\u00a0for approval.\u00a0<\/p><p>Combined with an effective public\u00a0charging\u00a0network, Ireland's home\u00a0charging\u00a0policy will help sustain and service the expected growth\u00a0of electric vehicles on Irish roads.\u00a0Charging\u00a0while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle\u00a0charging\u00a0in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home\u00a0charging\u00a0as the most common and cheapest form of\u00a0charging.\u00a0To support home\u00a0charging, the SEAI, on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.<\/p><p>Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home\u00a0charger\u00a0grant to include shared parking in\u00a0apartment\u00a0blocks and similar developments. However, there are a number of complex planning issues to address before we can expand the grant in an appropriate manner so as to include the required categories of shared parking.\u00a0My Department is working closely with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address the issues.<\/p><p>On new builds, it should be noted that the EU energy performance and buildings directive requires member states to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is installed in all new residential and non-residential buildings as well as those buildings with more than ten car parking spaces for the purpose of enabling the installation of a larger stage of charging points for electric vehicles. This is currently being transposed into Irish law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300085#WRM04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":621,"content":"<p>Question No. 235 answered with Question No. 234.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":622,"content":"<p>Question No. 236 answered with Question No. 234.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300085#WRM04700"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[30310\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300085#WRM04800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when driver theory tests will recommence.","asker":"1569","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>In line with the further easing of restrictions, the gradual re-opening of in-person driver theory test centres will commence after the 7th\u00a0of June.

Local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, population distribution, public service demands, infrastructure and other income sources, all factors which should be taken into account when comparing levels of funding in different local authority areas. <\/p>  <p>  Most of the funding from Central Government must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport. Across all schemes and funding sources, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provided &euro;135.3m and &euro;167.5m to\u00a0Cork County Council in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The increase between 2019 and 2020 is due to an increase in housing funding, as well as funding in respect of the Covid-19 rates waiver and other Covid related expenses that occurred in 2020. No report concerning funding specific to Cork County Council has been referred to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 996,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.<\/p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  <\/p>  <p>  Extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.<\/p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.

This process was established to support dialogue with survivors and their representatives while the statutory Commission of Investigation was conducting its examination of related matters. \u00a0This important context was recognised in the published Charter, which set out the general functions of the Forum and provided a blueprint for its methodology and programme of work.<\/p>  <p>  Our learnings from the Forum process primarily centre on the fundamental importance and value of structured engagement and consistent communication with survivors. I recognise that many survivors want to contribute to the development of solutions to the issues of concern to them and their families. As the Deputy will be aware, I have personally engaged with survivors and advocacy groups since my appointment and will continue to engage with those most centrally involved with these matters.<\/p>  <p>  For these reason, I am committed to ongoing engagement with survivors and their advocates in the context of the 22 actions approved by Government in responding to the findings of the Commission. These measures, which take account of the Commission's recommendations and those of the Collaborative Forum, are intended to respond to the priority needs and concerns of former residents and their families. <\/p>  <p>  Notably, several hundred survivors have contacted my Department since the Commission&rsquo;s report was published in January.\u00a0 Many of these individuals had never been in contact with my Department before. This increased level of engagement is also evident from the consultation process established to inform development of a Restorative Recognition Scheme, with approximately 450 written submissions received and 159 participants in 17 online meetings. <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined, our experience to date tells us that stakeholder engagement at this level requires additional dedicated structures, processes and resources to ensure it can be inclusive, effective and sustainable. I held two virtual meetings with members of the Collaborative Forum in February during which future arrangements for stakeholder engagement was a specific agenda item. The Facilitator to the Forum has engaged in detailed discussions with individual members in relation to a preliminary proposal in this regard. I understand this process is nearing completion and look forward to hearing their feedback. The experience of Forum members, and other stakeholders with whom I have engaged, will assist the development of a new and enhanced model of engagement. <\/p>  <p>  As I have acknowledged previously, the Collaborative Forum process, including the initiated formative evaluation, was unfortunately interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. After its meeting in December 2019, it was considered necessary to postpone plenary meetings in 2020 in the context of the public health restrictions. A number of members travel from outside the jurisdiction and some were in the at-risk groups identified by public health authorities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The formative evaluation into the Collaborative Forum was commissioned by the then Minister with a view to informing decisions on operation of that model and identifying priority issues for further consideration. In this regard, the outcome of the process can equally contribute to current deliberations on the design and implementation of an appropriate model to support engagement.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with the arrangements being advanced to facilitate publication of the Forum&rsquo;s report, I expect to be able to share the outcome of the evaluation with Forum members in the coming weeks.\u00a0 My Department will engage directly will Forum members in this regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300089#WRQ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":845,"content":"<p>Question No. 313 answered with Question No. 312.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":847,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[30301\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300089#WRQ04300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"when the Oak Report relating to the Mother and Baby Homes Collaborative Forum will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":848,"content":"<p>As part of its response to the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes (and Certain Related Matters), the\u00a0Government has committed to establishing a Restorative Recognition Scheme for survivors of mother and baby\u00a0and county home institutions.

Measures to support employer engagement in apprenticeship, particularly within the SME sector, will be integral to the delivery of that target. <\/p>  <p>  As a demand driven programme, the number of apprentice placements is determined by employers within the construction sector. In recent years, annual intake in construction related apprenticeships has steadily been increasing, from a low of 650 in 2010 to 3,499 in 2019. The impact of Covid-19 and the closure of the construction sector in March 2020 impacted heavily on apprentice registrations in the first half of 2020. Registrations recovered in the second half of the year with the support of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, which provides an employer grant of &euro;3,000 payable over two years to support employers who take on and retain apprentices, reaching a total of 3,104 registrations on construction related apprenticeships by year end.<\/p>  <p>  Work has begun on the implementation of the Action Plan.\u00a0 Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967 seek to expand the definition of an \"activity of industry\" to widen the potential scope of new apprenticeship programmes (Action 5.2) has been included under the General Scheme of Higher Education Authority Bill which was published on the 6th May 2021.

However, there are a few exceptions in relation to apprentices:<\/p>  <p>  -  In the case of statutory apprentices, the Unfair Dismissals Acts do not apply if the dismissal takes place within six months after the commencement of the apprenticeship or within one month after the completion of the apprenticeship. (Section 4 of the UD Act)<\/p>  <p>  -  An employer of an apprentice is not obliged to pay a redundancy lump sum under the Redundancy Payments Acts if the dismissal takes place within one month after the completion of the apprenticeship. (Section 7(4) of the RP Act)<\/p>  <p>  -  Apprenticeships are excluded from the remit of the National Minimum Wage.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this it is important to note that it is\u00a0a central principle of the apprenticeship system in Ireland\u00a0that both apprentices and their employers\u00a0are assured of a high-quality apprenticeship experience leading to recognised awards. There are a number of processes in place to support this, underpinned by statute under the Industrial Training Act 1967 and the Quality Assurance and Qualifications Act 2012, including:<\/p>  <p>  -  &lsquo;The Apprenticeship Code of Practice&rsquo;, published by SOLAS,\u00a0covers the key obligations of employers and apprentices participating in apprenticeship.\u00a0Employers are required to sign up to this code prior\u00a0to engaging apprentices. Companies seeking to recruit apprentices\u00a0are also required to undertake the SOLAS &lsquo;Suitability to Train Assessment&rsquo; prior to being admitted onto the register of approved employers. <\/p>  <p>  -  The network of Authorised Officers (AOs) of the Education and Training Boards (ETBs), working on behalf of SOLAS, continually engage with employers and individual apprentices throughout their apprenticeship programme, ensuring\u00a0adherence to the Code of Practice as well as providing ongoing supports. <\/p>  <p>  -  All\u00a0SOLAS approved training organisations and tutors are subject to independent scheduled process monitoring and\/or unscheduled assessment event monitoring to ensure adherence with both Quality Qualifications\u00a0Ireland (QQI) accreditation and SOLAS requirements. <\/p>  <p>  -  A comprehensive quality assurance process for apprenticeships covers the quality of delivery on and off the job training and is overseen by QQI through co-ordinating providers. <\/p>  <p>  -  The\u00a0employer is the provider of &lsquo;on-the-job&rsquo; elements of the Apprenticeship Programme and is responsible for apprentice direction, observation, supervision, and, if applicable, assessment. Employers are required to: <\/p>  <p>  -  Ensure that the apprentice is released to attend the mandatory apprenticeship induction presentation.<\/p>  <p>  -  Release the apprentice for the off-the-job training elements of the\u00a0Apprenticeship Programme on the dates and to the location as notified.<\/p>  <p>  -  Regularly\u00a0communicate with the apprentice and his\/her workplace mentor and\/or assessor\/verifier to monitor how the apprentice is progressing.<\/p>  <p>  -  Be proactive in reviewing the apprentice's progress and provide support,\u00a0advice and encouragement to the apprentice throughout the apprenticeship.<\/p>  <p>  -  The\u00a0trade union movement are an integral part of the delivery of the\u00a0apprenticeship system in Ireland.

The Unit also analyses and disseminates STRs and intelligence gained to other national units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Garda&iacute; throughout the country for investigation and potential further action.<\/p>  <p>  The MLIU supports the FIU within GNECB and it investigates complex money laundering cases and\/or cases which have cross-jurisdictional links.

The\u00a0Unit also provides advice and assistance to other members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are investigating cases of suspected complex money laundering and\/or suspected terrorist financing. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I wish to assure the Deputy that Ireland has a robust Anti-Money Laundering\/ Countering the Financing of Terrorism framework. Ireland&rsquo;s anti-money laundering framework was assessed by the global standard-setter, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Ireland was found to have &ldquo;a generally sound legislative and institutional AML\/CFT framework&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I welcomed the passage through the D&aacute;il of two important pieces of criminal legislation to help combat money laundering and tackle white collar crime. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021 will strengthen existing anti-money laundering legislation and will give effect to provisions of the Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive. This Act ensures that our regulatory framework keeps pace with the increasing integration of financial flows in the internal market, the evolving trends, technological developments and the prevention of organised crime. <\/p>  <p>  In line with international standards adopted by the FATF, and the EU's legislative framework, Ireland has developed a solid regulatory framework for preventing money laundering. This Act strengthens existing anti-money laundering legislation and contains a renewed focus on gatekeepers of financial systems. It ensures that there is increasing transparency by bringing further institutions within the scope of the Irish anti-money laundering regulatory framework and by combatting the use of new trends and technologies employed by criminals. It also ensures that our regulatory framework keeps pace with the increasing integration of financial flows in the internal market, the evolving trends, technological developments and the prevention of organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act gives effect to EU Directive 2017\/1371 on the fight against fraud to the European Union&rsquo;s financial interests by means of criminal law. The Directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions with regard to combatting fraud and other illegal activities (corruption and money laundering) affecting the EU&rsquo;s financial interests.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out to the Deputy that, as outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, the fight against organised crime stretches beyond our borders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with their international colleagues to break the networks of serious criminals and prevent them from inflicting misery on our communities.\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly liaises and cooperates with their international policing and security partners, such as EUROPOL and INTERPOL, and the FIU&rsquo;s work makes an important contribution to the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300091#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cybersecurity Policy","counter":931,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300091#WRS00800"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[30429\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300091#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which provision has been made to detect and prevent cyber-crime in the future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":933,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Environment, Climate\u00a0and Communications has primary responsibility for cybersecurity, including the protection of Government data and networks, as well as critical national infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department\u00a0focuses on the potential and actual criminal use made of the internet and information technology.

These include increasing access to addiction treatment, employment opportunities and increased use of community funded organisations. A range of objectives and actions have been outlined for progression of this throughout this year as outlined in Goal 3 of the Justice Plan 2021, including the forthcoming publication of\u00a0a Review on Penal Policy, which will set out actions to be taken going forward in order to reduce the rate of reoffending. <\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0number of initiatives have been\u00a0introduced over the past decade to reduce reoffending including Community Return and Community Support Schemes and the Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC). <\/p>  <p>  Community Return and Community Support Schemes were introduced in 2011 and\u00a0aim to increase support for prisoners prior to their release from prison, upon their release, and then for a period after their release in order to break the cycle of offending. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0J-ARC is a multi-agency response to the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders which commenced in 2014. The programme aims to target prolific offenders who are responsible for large amounts of crime. These offenders are managed through the integration of policy and practice between the J-ARC agencies.<\/p>  <p>  We\u00a0have some statistical evidence available to suggest that the initiatives introduced to date to reduce prison re-offending have contributed to a decline in recidivism. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) use data from the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop comprehensive prison re-offending indicators. The latest figures for Probation Re-offending Statistics, published by the CSO in November 2020, is a detailed study of recidivism among offenders placed under Probation Service supervision, including those on Community Service Orders. The Report is based on Reoffending statistics for 2014 and 2015 and in particular the 2016 cohort. <\/p>  <p>  Overall almost 69% of offenders did not reoffend within a one year period of being placed under the supervision of the Service. The Report also\u00a0showed that 71.7% of\u00a0offenders on Community Service Orders did not reoffend within that period and\u00a084.1% for those under Post Release\u00a0Supervision Order did not reoffend.<\/p>  <p>  We know that reoffending rates are decreasing over time, with\u00a031.1% of 2016 probationers reoffending within one year, compared to almost 36% of 2008 probationers who reoffended in one year. A similar trend is also observed in the three year study: re-offending by those sentenced to probation supervision in 2014 was 47.2% after a 3 year period, compared to a figure of 54.6% after 3 years for the 2008 cohort. The reoffending rates reflect improvements in Probation Service supervision, and indicates that the Service is continuing to perform well. Reoffending by persons subject to post release supervision is encouragingly low which confirms our belief that supervision and support in the community after release improves positive resettlement and reduces harmful behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Last year\u00a0my\u00a0Department\u00a0launched the findings from an international evidence review on recidivism and policy responses. This report, which\u00a0is the third in a series of releases to be commissioned and disseminated by the Research and Data Analytics unit in my Department, \u00a0was prepared by Prof. Ian O&rsquo;Donnell from the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Justice, School of Law,\u00a0UCD. The review constitutes a valuable resource for researchers and acts as a springboard for future empirical research on best practice in this area.  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300091#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":945,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300091#WRS02200"},{"type":"question","counter":946,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[30435\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300091#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for citizenship in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":947,"content":"<p>An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person\u00a0referred to by the Deputy\u00a0on 2 September 2020.

It undertakes very limited direct procurement, with the exception of the procurement of transport services for the Islands. All procurement takes place in line with national and EU guidance and requirements, and it is Department policy to utilise Office of Government Procurement framework agreements wherever possible. Where other bodies are provided grant funding by my Department, and this grant funding is to be used for the procurement of goods or services, the grantee is also obliged to follow national and EU guidance where the grant funding constitutes the main funding source.<\/p>  <p>  The LEADER programme would be the most significant programme in terms of grantees undertaking procurement with tenders for projects under &euro;200,000. In line with the EU Regulations by which it is governed, that programme stipulates that national procurement guidelines must be followed before funding is awarded by the Local Action Groups (LAGs). In cases where the total public funding awarded represents more than 50% of the project costs, the national public procurement requirements developed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) apply. However, where the public funding awarded represents 50% or less of the project costs, the project applicant can follow more flexible LEADER specific procurement rules developed by my Department. In circumstances such as these, written quotations must be sought on the various threshold amounts and there is no requirement to follow national procurement guidelines. My Department&rsquo;s officials have previously engaged with the OGP with a view to simplifying the procurement process for community applicant type projects, which are grant aided through programmes such as LEADER. My Department will continue to\u00a0explore this matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the OGP, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The agencies under the remit of my Department are Water Safety Ireland, the Western Development Commission, the Charities Regulator and POBAL who are obliged to follow EU and National public procurement rules and procedures. In the case of Pobal the vast majority of their tenders are above &euro;200,000. Where a tender process is below this value Pobal complies with OGP guidelines. To reduce any bureaucracy associated with a below threshold tender Pobal only require a single document for tender responses. This document clearly outlines where tenderers are required to input. Proof of qualifying criteria is only required for the successful tenderer. For procurement processes below &euro;25,000 Pobal uses a simplified quote document. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there are a number of guidance documents and model form contracts aimed at facilitating public bodies in carrying out public works contracts. This information can be found on the construction procurement website www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie.
