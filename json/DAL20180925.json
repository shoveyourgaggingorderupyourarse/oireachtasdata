We were told it was historic and that its aim was to establish a child-centred approach to protecting all children.  Another aim was to support families who were struggling rather than allow crisis situations to develop.  Part of Article 42A inserted in the Constitution recognises that all children have rights and pledges to uphold those rights by law.  On the ground, however, that admirable intent has not been achieved six years later.  The assessment of needs for children with disabilities is not being provided.  The Disability Act 2005 provides that an assessment should be carried out within three months of it being requested, but the latest figures supplied to my colleague, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, and to RT&Eacute; news illustrate that there are more than 3,850 children with suspected disabilities who have still not had an assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced in 2016 that 128 disability care teams would be put in place and that they would resolve the waiting times.  In 2018 there are only 56 such teams in place and, in fact, the waiting lists have grown longer.  There are 37,229 people in the country on speech and language therapy waiting lists.  Some 15,000 of them are waiting for the crucial first assessment.  A further 7,894 are waiting for their first treatment and 14,300 are waiting for further therapy.  Separately, there are 31,000 people waiting for occupational therapy and over half of these, more than 16,800, are children who await a first assessment.  More than 6,000 of that 16,800 have been waiting longer than one year for the crucial first assessment.<\/p><p>As one can imagine, this is causing huge frustration, anger and worry for parents and families.  Where is the child-centred approach promised in 2012?  For those who can afford it, they are paying hundreds of euro just to get a diagnosis.  Even in the public system, there are inconsistencies in the treatment across the country, when one can get it.  How can the Government stand over this inaction and lack of delivery in any improvement of waiting times for assessments under the Disability Act 2005?  Does the Taoiseach believe this situation is defensible and acceptable and what plans does he, as Taoiseach, have in place to ensure these waiting lists are prioritised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500003#A00200","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537880700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilte romhat ar ais.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500004#B00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1537880700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.

In the health area, children with profound disabilities, 40,000 of whom are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, now have a medical card as of right.  They do not have to be means-tested based on their parents' income.  When the party opposite was in power children, even though they had profound disabilities, were not provided with free healthcare or medical cards because their parents were working, or had an average, or in some cases below average, income.  We have changed that.  We have also brought in free GP care for the under sixes.  In the area of the Ministry of children, a dedicated Ministry set up in recent years, we have brought in two years of free preschool, giving children early childhood education which is so beneficial for them.<\/p>  <p>  In the last year or so, we brought in subsidised childcare, reducing the cost of childcare for lots of parents around the country.  We all know the enormous burden that childcare costs are on families.  Those subsidies help to make a difference and we propose to continue them in the years ahead.  Also, in terms of leave for parents in order that they can spend more time with their children, we brought in paid paternity benefit for the first time.  I appreciate there are areas where there are still enormous difficulties and areas where more work needs to be done.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the assessments under the Disability Act 2005, to which the Deputy referred, the number of applications has risen steadily since it it was enacted.  There were 1,138 applications in 2007.  However, in 2017, there were 5,839 applications, such that in the space of ten years, there was an almost five-fold increase in the number of applications.  The system is struggling to deal with this level of demand.  There is a new standing operating procedure for the assessment of need but it has been delayed due to necessary discussions and consultations with the professional bodies.  This process is now entering its final stages and we hope that if we can get it agreed it will make a real difference.  Also, efforts to progress the establishment of disability network teams around the country have been delayed as well, due to deliberations with F&oacute;rsa and with voluntary providers on the appointment of managers of these teams but an agreement has now been made and this will allow recruitment to start in the next month for some of the community healthcare organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500004#B00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1537880700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Does the Taoiseach get it?

Private rents and house prices continue to spiral out of control.  Social housing output remains glacial with fewer real council houses to be delivered this year than last year.  Not a single affordable home to rent or buy has been delivered by Government over the past three years.  An entire generation of young people, unlike their parents before them, face the prospect of never owning their own home.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, assumed office, homelessness has reached unprecedented levels.  Tonight almost 4,000 children will sleep in emergency accommodation and all the while the Taoiseach persists with a plan that is not only failing but is, in fact, making things worse.  People know that and they are justifiably angry.  That is why thousands of people demonstrated at the Take Back the City rally in Dublin last weekend.  That is just a glimpse of that anger.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions' Raise the Roof demonstration on 3 October will amplify that message all the more loudly.<\/p>  <p>  Yet the Taoiseach and the Minister blame everyone but themselves for their failure to address the underlying issue, namely, a lack of homes.  They have blamed local authorities, local councillors and opposition Deputies and I heard the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on RT&Eacute; radio this morning explaining away his deplorable record by saying that the numbers of people in homelessness are going up because people keep on presenting to emergency accommodation.  I want to know if the Minister is now blaming the homeless for being homeless because the buck stops with him.  Both the Minister and the Taoiseach are responsible but their plan is not working.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister claims that Sinn F&eacute;in has not offered solutions but we have offered ample solutions.  We have offered solutions around investment in social and affordable housing, the introduction of a temporary tax relief for renters, alongside a rent freeze, the introduction of legislation to prevent buy-to-let landlords from seeking vacant possessions and the proposal to introduce legislation requiring local authorities to offer assistance to those at risk of losing their homes or tenancies.  These are alternatives - take them and use them.  Listen to the NGOs, listen to the approved housing bodies and take their alternatives and use them.  It is not that no one has offered solutions; it is that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, have refused to act and to listen.

I agree with Deputy McDonald on one point, which is that the underlying problem is a lack of housing supply.  We have a country that has a growing population.  The population grew by more than 60,000 people last year through natural increases and inward migration and as a result of Irish people who had left coming home.  When the population increases by about 60,000 a year it stands to reason that we need to build many new homes every year, probably about 30,000 to 35,000, and we are not doing that yet.

The one consistency I have seen in the Government's policy in all that time is that it is wedded to the philosophy that the markets will fix it.  I have news for the Taoiseach: the markets will not fix it.  They do not want to fix it, they actually like it the way it is.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's latest inspiration is the Land Development Agency.  The Taoiseach described it as radical.  It is the opposite of radical.  It is not the ESB or Aer Lingus.  It promises to be crony capitalism at its finest.  This is the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, mark 2, exactly what we do not need.  It is soul destroying that the Government would appoint a former NAMA individual as chief executive officer.  That is like getting the fox to mind the chickens.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example of how crony capitalism works in this country.  Avestus is an Irish asset management company which has decided it would like to build residential property.  The four directors of Avestus were in NAMA.  They had directors' loans worth &euro;350 million.  In 2012 NAMA decided to sell the loans to a company registered in Luxembourg for &euro;26 million, a 92% discount.  Last week it emerged the Luxembourg company and Avestus share a director, in breach of the NAMA Act 2009.  One could not make it up but it gets worse.  Avestus has received &euro;25 million from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to develop.  We literally allowed this company to buy its loans back for peanuts and now we are funding it to build.  Can it be true that the Government wants to use the expertise in NAMA for the Land Development Agency?  It wants to do deals with developers to build out State land while they sit on their own land.  This is nuts.  The developer is looking for a profit margin in the region of &euro;80,000 a unit.  Why would the Government want to put money in the developer's pocket?  Why did NAMA want to do it?  NAMA is funding Gannon Homes to build three-bed semi-detached houses in Millers Glen in Swords.  Prices start at &euro;365,000.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government says that is affordable, but affordable for who? <\/p>  <p>  The Government says the Land Development Agency will put downward pressure on land prices.  How will it do that?  Can the Taoiseach explain that to me?  What will put downward pressure on land prices is a 25% tax on land-banking and I hope the Government allows the legislation for that to go through the House with a bit of speed rather than let it collect dust.  As for the State land, if the Taoiseach thinks the local authorities are not fit for purpose to supply housing why does the Government not strengthen the local authorities and make them fit for purpose, give them the necessary skilled personnel and let them hire builders, not developers, to build housing that is 100% affordable not 30% and 10%?  Why should we allow State land be used to provide a minimum of 60% at a price that is unaffordable to most people?  Will the Taoiseach explain why we would do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500007#E02300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1537883100,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Deputy Wallace spoke once again about spin over substance.  If he wants substance, here it is.  There were 14,000 new homes built last year, which is 50% more than the year before.  This year 20,000 new homes will be built.  That is a significant number of new homes being built in this country for people and families to live in.  These are real homes with front doors, brick walls, windows and gardens.  It is not spin.  They are there.  There is some evidence that house prices are starting to level off.  Rent increases have gone from double digit increases to 1% or 1.1% in the last two quarters.  In the last year 5,000 families were taken out of homelessness.  Rough sleeping is also down by 40%.  These are real numbers and there are real facts and real people behind all of those, and real substance.  I am not pretending for a second that there is not much more that needs to be done or that we have got on top of this issue.  I am not claiming that but I am giving real factual examples of the progress that has been made.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the view of this Government that the market will fix it.  That is a charge made against us by our opponents but it is not the case.  If we believe that the market on its own could fix the problems in our housing sector we would not be investing in 110,000 new public homes.  That is what is there.  It is in Rebuilding Ireland and Project Ireland 2040.  It is a substantial public housing building programme with 110,000 public homes to be built over the next ten years.  Last year 7,000 houses were already added to the stock and that will rise to 10,000 in the years ahead.  That is where we think it needs to be, at about 10,000 new homes being built every year by the public sector.  If we believed the charges of Deputy Wallace, that the private sector had all of the solutions, we certainly would not be implementing a policy like that.  We also have the Land Development Agency which is designed to operate like a semi-State such as An Post, the ESB or Telecom &Eacute;ireann in the past.  It has a commercial mandate but its primary principle is not to make a profit.  It is to deliver necessary infrastructure and services for people and to break even and that is the way it is going to work.

As a Deputy representing Tipperary, a predominantly rural constituency, I see the decline of communities, the reduction of resources, the closure of facilities, and a growing sense of disillusionment amongst the rural population.  This is happening at a time our economy is improving at a faster rate than any in Europe.  This economic trend is bypassing rural Ireland.  The opportunities created by this growth in our economy are designed to sustain urban areas at the expense of rural Ireland.  The Government and the national agencies are not doing enough to correct the imbalance between city and rural regeneration.  There has been a gradual erosion of confidence and belief in the Government's support for rural development.  In recent years, there has been a growing perception, evident in public policies such as the national development plan, that the future of Ireland only exists in the context of urban development and facilitation.  People in rural Ireland now believe they are undervalued and less important in this new post-Brexit Ireland.  There is an unsettling mood of powerlessness among rural dwellers.  This is affecting their well-being and enthusiasm for continuing to contribute to an economy and society that offers little in return.  The urban sector is absorbing a disproportionate amount of available resources.  A balance must be restored or rural Ireland will die quickly and quietly.<\/p>  <p>  The facts are clear.  Agriculture and food production are the backbone of the rural economy.  Every sector in agriculture is under enormous pressure and struggling to survive.  Farm costs have escalated dramatically and net income has been decimated.  Rural roads are neglected to the extent that many are impassable.  Poor access to a proper broadband service and information technology is a huge disadvantage.  It is impossible for country towns to attract industry as they have little prospect of competing against the city locations that have it in place.  Rural depopulation is rampant due to lack of jobs.  Significant numbers of young people are forced to migrate to urban centres.  Post offices are closing in huge numbers without consideration of the social and community impact.<\/p>  <p>  We have a wonderful nation of talented and creative people and, regardless of their addresses, those people are entitled to feel valued and empowered.  We have to look at Ireland as a single entity and not two separate components.  Our policies must be national and must benefit everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500009#G00500","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1537883700,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and I assure him that the Government is committed to rural Ireland and to making sure that it is vibrant and prosperous and a place that people want to live in, stay in, and move their families to and where they can establish successful businesses.  Our plan for the nation, Project Ireland 2040, has rural Ireland at its heart.  We want the cities outside Dublin to grow twice as fast as Dublin for the first time and we want 200,000 more people living in rural Ireland by 2040.  I travel around the country regularly, as does the Deputy, and it is becoming more evident that there are very different rural Irelands.<\/p><p> The tourist towns are very different from the market towns.  What may be happening in a small town can be very different from what is happening in another town.  We have plenty of towns that are vibrant and are doing well and we have other towns that are doing very poorly, where one can see the empty shop fronts and derelict premises in the town square.  It is very sad to see that.  At the same time we see towns and villages that are doing extremely well.  We know that in every county in Ireland, bar two, the population has increased in last five years, and in every county, bar none, the population has increased in the last ten.  Even in counties one can see movements from smaller towns to bigger towns and from some areas to others.<\/p> <p> At the centre of ensuring rural Ireland does well is making sure there are good jobs.  Jobs allow people to stay in the community, move into those communities and create revenue that supports business in those areas.  We have seen a dramatic reduction in the percentage of people unemployed in recent years, down from 15% in 2012 to only 5.6% now.  In the Deputy's own county of Tipperary, very much a rural county although a county with many large to medium-sized towns, the number of unemployed has gone from 18,000 in 2012 down to 9,000 now.  The number of unemployed has halved in the last six years, which is really significant.  We have seen jobs growth in seven out of all eight regions, and in the year gone by, four out of every five new jobs created were created outside of Dublin.<\/p> <p> We have seen some really encouraging job announcements - for example, Combilift in Monaghan.  I was there to hear 200 jobs announced.  Some 90 jobs were added in Burnfoot by E+I in Donegal.  Netwatch in Carlow is another example.  What is great to see about those companies is that they are Irish indigenous companies setting up in our small towns and going global.  We need to see more of that.  We obviously need to continue to bring foreign direct investment, FDI, into the country and continue to promote foreign investment, but we need to further support Irish companies that do well and can grow themselves.<\/p> <p> On broadband, I think the Deputy makes a very valid point.  It is important to bear in mind that when this Government, Fine Gael and the Independents, came into office, about 52% of premises in Ireland had access to high-speed broadband.  That is up to about 75% now, and we are going to go the whole way so that we become one of the first countries in the world where every premises, no matter how remote, has access to broadband.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500009#G00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537884000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Taoiseach's overview.

At the time, the Taoiseach said to me that it was an issue and I said people in rural areas felt abandoned, forgotten, neglected.  Many roads are impassable due to their condition.  We need a concerted and co-ordinated plan to restore rural roads.  The last time I raised this the Taoiseach said in response that he would look at it when the councils had spent the money they had been allocated.

That is in line with increases in the budget for roads across the country.  Moreover the local improvement scheme, which is really important for people living on laneways that are not taken in charge, was restored and a budget of &euro;10.8 million was set aside for it.<\/p>  <p>  First, I encourage local authorities that have not spent all their allocation to do so.

Suckler farmers are under considerable pressure this year and Deputy Healy-Rae is right to say that a considerable amount of suckler cows have been sold.  The size of the national herd is dropping significantly as a result of the pressure, particularly because of the drought and concerns as to whether there will be enough fodder over the winter.  It is important that any possible supports be provided to that sector of the farming community.

Most people are being told they have to pay for the home help services privately to be able to subsidise the State's intervention.  It is really unacceptable because many people are on the poverty line.  They find that when an elderly relative or another individual comes home from hospital, they cannot get home help services for him or her.  They are told to pay for it themselves when they cannot afford to do so.  In the forthcoming budget, I expect a strong commitment from the Government to put the funding in place to ensure the promise in the programme for Government is kept in respect of this.  It saves money in the long run.

This follows international precedents.  For example, the UK's Climate Change Act 2008 sets specific targets for both 2050 and 2020.  Despite our international commitments the Government's attitude towards climate change has been less than exemplary.  Ireland is now unique in Europe in the scale of its failure to meet both emissions and renewable energy targets.  Earlier this summer, the Climate Change Advisory Council outlined how Ireland will fail to meet both its 2020 and 2030 targets and will fail to decarbonise the Irish economy by 2050.<\/p><p>This is simply not good enough and without action we will face massive charges and changes to our climate.  Met &Eacute;ireann projects a 30% increase in heavy rain and storm events, a 1&deg; centigrade to 1.6&deg; centigrade increase in average temperature and a decrease of 50% in the number of frost days by 2050.  Sitting on our hands and expecting others to do the heavy lifting for us is not good enough.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 contained no eventual or specific targets for Ireland's emissions reductions.  Fianna F&aacute;il heavily criticised this aspect of the legislation at the time of its introduction.  These targets appeared in Ireland's first attempt to legislate for climate change, which was the Climate Change Response Bill 2010 brought forward by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party coalition Government, yet this Government did not deem them worthy of inclusion in its legislation.  We recognised that its legislation was a roadmap to nowhere and that it did not set clear metrics for the Government or its policy makers.  Sadly, our fears have proven well founded.<\/p><p>This Bill seeks to address this issue and amends the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 to set specific targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  These are: an 89% reduction by 2050 relative to 1990 levels; a 40% reduction by 2030 relative to 1990 levels; a 20% reduction by 2020 relative to 2005 levels.  These targets are in line with Ireland's international commitments and are clear targets towards which the country should strive.  They will hold the Government to account on its rhetoric and promises and ensure that Ireland plays its part in the battle to prevent further climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500017#P00500","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1537887000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Is

What plans does the Taoiseach have to reinvigorate the BIC?  While I accept that the focus of London right now is on Brexit, urgency needs to be injected into addressing the vacuum in the Northern Ireland Executive.

While that reassurance is welcome, is there a contradiction in his references to the recruitment of customs officials and his statement that we will not accept a hard border because the former would appear to suggest that the State is preparing to erect trade and customs barriers?  Can he give us an assurance that those customs officials will not be deployed at any point along the Border, regardless of what happens, or what deals do or do not happen, between Europe and Britain?  While I do not trust the Tory Brexiteers, I also do not trust the EU to not insist on a border to protect the Single Market, which would be unacceptable.

While former Prime Minister Cameron attended one such meeting during his six year tenure, the practice since the early days of the Good Friday Agreement has been that the Taoiseach attends on behalf of Ireland and the Secretary of State attends on behalf of the UK Government.  I have not spoken to Prime Minister May about her attending the council but I have spoken to her about the need for a new mechanism by which the British and Irish Governments can engage on a structured basis.  We do this well at the moment because both countries are in the EU and every Minister and his or her UK counterpart attends EU Councils three or four times a year, which is always a good opportunity for bilaterals.  We will now move from a situation whereby we see each other at least four times a year in Brussels to a situation whereby we will not.  This will happen from March next year and I have spoken to Prime Minister May about how we might deal with that and put in place a structured mechanism by which the two sovereign governments could meet more regularly.  Perhaps, the mechanism for doing this is not the BIC, but the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, which can meet in different formats.  The Good Friday Agreement may have been more foreseeing than any of us could have imagined in that, perhaps, this mechanism for east-west co-operation between the two sovereign Governments could be reinvigorated and used an opportunity for us engage Minister to Minister and Prime Minister to Prime Minister on a structured basis after the UK leaves the European Union in March.<\/p>  <p>  On the backstop, or the protocol in Ireland and Northern Ireland, Prime Minister May once again restated her commitment to having a legally operable backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement.  In Salzburg, the other 26 member states reiterated their solidarity with Ireland and restated our position that there will not be a withdrawal agreement and no transition period for the UK if there is not an Irish protocol - a legally operable Irish backstop - as part of that agreement.  I believe we will get there - and in November - because nobody wants us to end up in a no deal scenario.  The damage for the UK would be immense.  The damage for Ireland would also be immense and it would have a serious impact on other countries like Belgium, Holland, France and Denmark.  As I said, I believe we will get there in November but we are in uncharted territory.<\/p><p>I have sought a lot of advice on this over the past couple of weeks and over the summer.  I have met many wise old heads who know Europe, British politics and Northern Ireland and all the issues around it and I came away from those meetings with the advice that it is uncharted territory and unpredictable and I was advised to do my best.  That was probably the best advice I could have got.  We will have to stay engaged and stay vigilant and that is what we will do in the period ahead.<\/p> <p> In terms of talks on getting the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly back up and running, the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are in touch about new talks.  There have been suggestions around the possibility of having an independent chair for these talks but I understand that proposal has not found favour with the DUP and it will not be possible to form an Executive in Northern Ireland unless the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in can come together and come to an agreement.  Northern Ireland unfortunately now holds the international record for failing to form a government, which is a real shame.  Clarity around Brexit could help so perhaps by the October or November summit, if there is one, we will have a road map as to how Brexit will work and what the new relationships will look like.  We might then be in a better position to bring the parties together again and Government stands ready to do exactly that.<\/p> <p> I did not have a chance to hear Sir Keir Starmer's speech so I cannot really comment on it but it is the case that any withdrawal agreement will have to be ratified by both Westminster and the European Parliament so while we may assume that because something is agreed by the European Council and the UK that it will go through both parliaments, we should not actually make that assumption.  There is the possibility that the Heads of Government in the European Council and the UK will come to a decision in October or November and we may find that it runs into ratification problems in Westminster or the European Parliament.  We will have to manage that and see how it develops.<\/p> <p> On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, we are recruiting customs and revenue officers for the ports and airports, particularly Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort.  It must be borne in mind that when the UK leaves the European Union, whether it is in March next year or at the end of the transition period at the start of 2021, it will be leaving the Single Market as well so there will be changes.  The rules of trade and the trading relationship between Britain and Ireland will not be as it is now.  We need to make provision for those changes and that is what we are doing but we will not be deploying any of them along the land Border with Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500018#Q00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1537888200,"counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500019#R00150"},{"type":"question","time":1537888200,"counter":174,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[30410\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500019#R00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet committee E, health, last met; and when it is scheduled to meet again.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1537888200,"counter":175,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[30674\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500019#R00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet committee E, health, last met.

The new programme office has been established and is now led by Laura Magahy and a Sl&aacute;intecare advisory council has been established, which will be chaired by Dr. Tom Keane who led the reform of the cancer services in Ireland some years ago.

I wrote to him in August asking that he meet with Catherine Corless and the Tuam mother and baby home survivors and I ask that of him again.  We owe a lot to Ms Corless for her research which uncovered the deaths of 796 children at the home.  When the Taoiseach meets with Ms Corless and the survivors, he will hear first hand of their particular healthcare needs.  One child died every fortnight when the home was in operation.  Many of those who survived a regime of malnutrition and neglect where measles, tuberculosis and pneumonia were rife now suffer very significant ill health and yet the Government has yet to provide a scheme specific to their needs.  Three years have passed since the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes was established and its timeline for reporting has been extended to February 2019.  We know from the industrial homes and the Magdalen laundry scandals that the State moves at a glacial pace in providing redress and access to supports and services when it finally accepts wrongdoing.

It was an opportunity for me to pay my respects to the children who were buried there and to see the site for myself.  It was not quite what I expected.  I expected to see the grounds of an old abandoned institution.  It is not that at all; it is a very small site, almost within a housing estate, beside a large playground.  I only had about 30 minutes.  I would have liked to meet with Catherine Corless, representatives of survivors, residents who have concerns and the local authority but in the period I had, about 30 or 40 minutes, it would not have been possible to do that or to do any of them justice.  It was a case of either postponing my visit for a later point in a few months' time or taking the opportunity to stop by and pay my respects and see the place for myself, which I did.  I have replied to Catherine Corless and I will meet her with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, because the Minister is the person who is dealing with this issue for the Government and who understands it in a depth that I do not.  I will meet her in due course when we are ready to make a decision on the next steps.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet sub-committee on health has not met to discuss the HSE budget overrun but it has been discussed at Cabinet.  As Deputies will know from my previous replies to questions on this issue, I tend to discuss more things with the full Cabinet than in the past.  In the past, bodies such as the Economic Management Council, EMC, or smaller groups were used to discuss important issues.  I decided to do it differently and to include the entire Cabinet more and to be more collective in decision-making rather than using bodies such as the EMC which excluded Ministers from decision-making in the past.  I am glad to have made some changes in that regard.  It has been discussed with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Health.  We are trying to get an accurate fix on the likely overrun.  We often talk in healthcare about how money should follow the patient and money should get to the patient.  We are not in a very good position at all to follow the money in the health service due to the very outdated financial systems so we are trying to calculate what the likely overrun is going to be for this year.  As things stand, notwithstanding the fact that health has a huge allocation of &euro;16 billion, which is the biggest ever in the history of the State, health spending is running 9% ahead of what it was last year so that overrun could be quite substantial.  It could be in the region of the figures people have seen in the newspapers and that certainly limits our room for manoeuvre when it comes to the budget in two weeks' time because much of that overrun will have to be accommodated in the base for next year as well.  Much of it is happening for good reasons.  Recruitment is happening apace.  There are 1,000 more nurses working in our public health system than we had this time last year.  There have been pay increases across the board for 115,000 healthcare staff.  Our children's hospital is flying up.  The urgent care centre in Blanchardstown is almost roof on at this stage.  We have extended things such as free GP care to carers because they need to be cared for too.  We are also seeing substantial reductions in the number of people waiting for operations and procedures in our hospitals.  Whether it is hips, eyes, knees, cataracts, angiograms or skin lesions being removed, there are 10,000 fewer people waiting for an operation or procedure now than a year ago.  The average person is waiting less than six months now for an operation or procedure.  We want to get that down to three months over the period ahead.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of medical cannabis, as I understand it, it is required that one has a prescription from a consultant and that one has a licence from the Minister for Health.  That is an unusual situation and not one that is desirable or workable.  I can guarantee the House that the Minister for Health, while he has signed all except one of the requests for a licence, does not want to be in a situation where he is doing that.  It is not the role of a politician to be signing licences for individuals to have their medicines.  That is why he is developing the cannabis access programme to do it better.  I understand they are running into difficulties with sourcing.  If this is a medicine, it needs to be treated like a medicine and we need to make sure it is at pharmaceutical and medicine grade.  They are running into difficulties in sourcing it.  <\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, I am not in a position to talk about individual cases or patients in the House.  I do not have access to patients' files or records.  No politician does or should.  There are issues of confidentiality and privacy involved in any individual case.  What I can say more generally is that patients can be moved to what is called the suspended list.  A patient who may be on a waiting list for surgery may become unfit for surgery for any number of reasons for a period.<\/p><p>They are put on a suspended waiting list but can then be put back on the active waiting list when they are fit for surgery again but I do not have the full information on individual cases and it would be wrong for me to comment on them.

However, I am acutely aware of the value placed by rural communities on services such as the local post office. <\/p>  <p>  Ensuring access to services for rural communities is an issue that cuts across almost all Departments.  It also relates to services provided by the private sector.  In my role as Minister for Rural and Community Development I am absolutely clear on the importance of ensuring that rural communities can access the services they need in order that they remain vibrant places in which to live and work.  Project Ireland 2040 laid out the Government&rsquo;s plans for the country&rsquo;s long-term development, and a key commitment within it regarding rural Ireland is the provision of &euro;1 billion for the new rural regeneration and development fund, which is an unprecedented commitment by Government to strengthen rural economies and in turn support stronger local communities.  Initially, &euro;315 million has been allocated for the period 2019 to 2022 and the first call for applications to the fund closes next Thursday.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of other funding programmes that support local communities throughout Ireland.  Of particular importance for those towns and villages most disadvantaged in terms of access to services include the CL&Aacute;R programme, which is a targeted investment programme for rural areas that aims to provide funding for small infrastructural projects and other initiatives in areas that have experienced significant levels of population decline.  The community enhancement programme was launched by my Department in May 2018 and provides small capital grants to community groups across the country.  I was delighted to announce a further &euro;8 million in funding for this programme last Friday, bringing the total for 2018 to &euro;12.5 million.  The town and village renewal scheme supports the revitalisation of rural towns and villages, with particular focus on projects which have a clear positive economic impact on local communities.  Since its launch in 2016, the town and village renewal scheme has invested &euro;31.6 million in more than 450 projects across the country.  The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, for 2018 to 2022, with funding of\u00a0&euro;38 million in 2018, provides capacity at local level to respond to the particular needs in each area.  It helps those seeking employment or starting their own business.  LEADER programme funding, administered by local action groups, LAGs, delivers the &euro;250 million programme funding in accordance with the specific objectives and needs identified by the LAGs themselves as part of the development of local development strategies.  Supports are tailored to the specific needs of each individual area.  Libraries will also work with local partners to reach disadvantaged, marginalised and new communities, increasing these communities&rsquo; awareness of services available for families establishing in the area and as a resource for all.  Some &euro;150 million is expected to be invested by local authorities in library services in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of directly facilitating access to services in rural Ireland, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has provided a funding allocation of &euro;14.9 million for Local Link services in 2018.

If the people in these places are given half a chance they will work harder than people from anywhere else, because they want to prove that their community is valuable and vibrant.  They want to make it work, but they have to get that chance.  They have to be stimulated by way of investment.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the &euro;350 million fund, the deadline for which falls next week.  My understanding is that much of that fund is earmarked for the larger towns in rural areas rather than the small villages which require investment.  Small villages are dying on their feet.  I drive through County Leitrim, and in places such as Drumkeeran, Mohill or Ballinamore, half of the shops are closed down.  Shops in those towns are depending on the local farmers coming in and spending money.  That is all they have.  That is all that exists.  We need to do something more than that for those areas.  We have to provide opportunity for investment and the only way that can be done is to pump money into them.  We should take risks on anyone who has an idea, because I can guarantee that those risks will pay back. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500023#V00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1537890600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I have provided &euro;80,000 to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to support the establishment of ten digital access post offices on a pilot basis.

There have never been as many people working and living in rural Ireland.  However, the small shops and little businesses that once were there are no longer present because people are shopping with their feet.  People are working in towns and going home to rural Ireland in the evening, and are using the bigger outlets.  That is a decision people are making and I do not criticise it.  People have rights.  They work hard, pay their taxes, and have an opportunity to go and live where they want to live and work where they want to work.  Where they spend their money is their business.  Rural Ireland is alive and well.  I listen to this kind of talk all the time.  Post offices were discussed at length over the summer.  The reason post offices are closing is they are not being used.  I heard the postmistress in my local area speaking on local radio recently.  She held a public meeting two years ago at which she was told by local people that they would use her post office.  She has said she is sorry for the few elderly people who were depending on it but she is not sorry for closing her post office, because people did not use it.  There is no answer to that.<\/p><p>Returning to the rural regeneration and development fund, there is an urban regeneration scheme and a rural one.  The urban scheme consists of &euro;2 billion for towns with a population of 10,000 or more.  The rural scheme will apply to towns with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants.  To me, the most effective scheme is the town and village renewal scheme, and the Deputy knows this.  I refer also to the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.  The Deputy's own town of Drumshanbo has received &euro;700,000 from my Department.  The boardwalk attracted 80,000 visitors last year.  Some eight new businesses were created around that.  We have to do business differently in rural Ireland now.  People say that rural Ireland is dead.  It is not dead.

It might be easier.<\/p>  <p>  The Revised Estimates for 2018\u00a0in respect of the Department of Rural and Community Development set out an allocation of &euro;87.5 million for gross capital expenditure, supplemented by\u00a0&euro;7.7 million carried forward\u00a0from 2017.  I have provided an update of capital expenditure to date across the various capital subheads, including carryover, in a detailed table for the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, total capital spend, including carryover at the end of August - I want the Deputy to listen to this - was at 70% of expected profile.  I will read that again.  Total capital spend at the end of August, including carryover, was 70% of the expected profile.  The community programme spending was 250% of profile at the end of August, reflecting earlier than anticipated spending on the community enhancement programme.\u00a0 Spending on the rural programme was at 60% of profile at the end of August.  At this point in September, the library development and archive service subhead is ahead of profile. \u00a0I am expecting an acceleration in spend towards end of year.  Some 52% of our capital spend is profiled for the last three months.  It is helpful to note that this acceleration is already evident.  For example, the spend on capital in August was the highest in any month of the year at &euro;6.2 million.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies should note that the figures for spending are not an accurate reflection of the work carried out on the ground by those receiving support.  In many cases, the projects in question are nearing completion, or are indeed completed.  The requests for reimbursement, however, have not yet been received by my Department.  For example, I announced the local improvement scheme, LIS, and allocations in February, early enough to give local authorities time to implement those projects.  Details of the costs incurred are now being received my Department and we will meet those as quickly as possible.  Leader programme drawdown is slower than I would like.  As the Deputy will be aware, considerable work has been undertaken in preparing, assessing and approving new Leader projects.  There is now a very clear pipeline of projects approved by local action groups, totalling almost &euro;40 million.  This will translate into increased spending over the remainder of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  I have instructed my officials to continue to closely monitor expenditure patterns and to stay in close contact with local authorities on planned spend.  Should it be the case that for whatever reason expenditure is not being drawn down as expected, I will look at other options for reallocation of that spend to meet other priorities.  For example, the Deputy will be aware that I have already been able to announce\u00a0&euro;6 million of support to enhance\u00a0digital services and facilities in public libraries. \u00a0Moreover, last week I announced &euro;8 million of additional investments under the community enhancement programme.<\/p>  <p>  My focus remains on fully using the capital funding allocated by the Government to provide for the betterment of\u00a0those living and working in rural communities throughout Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500024#W00700","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537891200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>TABLESUBHEAD &euro;'000's &euro;'000's Spend to 20th SeptAllocation V42 &ndash; GROSS28,066 95,208 A - REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT &amp;amp;   REGIONAL AFFAIRS22,810 85,855 A.2 - ADMINISTRATION - NON   PAY131 166 A.3 - DORMANT ACCOUNT MEASURES0 2,006 A.5 - NATIONAL RURAL   DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES2,078 18,083 A.6 - LEADER - RURAL ECONOMY   SUB PROGRAMME14,414 40,000 A.8 - TOWN AND VILLAGE   REGENERATION6,176 15,000 A.9 - RURAL BROADBAND,   REGIONAL ECONOMIC   DEVELOPMENT11 600 A.10 - LOCAL IMPROVEMENT   SCHEMES0 10,000 B - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT5,254 9,353 B.2 - ADMINISTRATION - NON   PAY93 136 B.6 &ndash; RAPID2,976 3,767 B.8 - PROGRAMME FOR PEACE AND     RECONCILIATION0 700 B.10 - LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT AND   ARCHIVE   SERVICE185 2,750 B.11 - COMMUNITY FACILITIES   FUND2,000 2,000<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537891200,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Minister for confirming what I have said.

The 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan, which was published in July, approved funding of up to &euro;39.7 million for 45 different measures across ten Departments.  In line with the provisions of the Dormant Accounts Acts, the measures identified in the action plan target social, economic and educational disadvantage and people with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  The approved measures will support a wide range of projects and programmes relating to issues such as social inclusion, assisting migrants, support for carers, speech and language therapy, support for dementia sufferers, and sports measures.  The majority of measures will commence in 2019, subject to Voted expenditure being available in each relevant Department.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to funding for projects based in Galway city and county, most of the measures in the action plan are national scale programmes, for example, sports measures for disadvantaged communities, a baby box measure through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and education and employment initiatives for disadvantaged communities.  The funding for specific geographic areas will only become clear as the measures are implemented on the ground.  However, while the delivery of measures is a matter for each relevant Department, I would expect such measures to impact throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  In my Department, the measure to support ICT utilisation among older people will involve the delivery of a pilot programme in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  The measure to support enterprise and digital hubs along the Atlantic economic corridor will also benefit Galway city and county directly.<\/p>  <p>  The dormant accounts have been the subject of discussion at the Committee of Public Accounts and the Department has tried to take hold of them in recent months.  Departmental officials have done an amount of work.  This is the third change of Department with responsibility for dormant accounts.  It has taken quite a while to get to the bottom of previous commitments, moneys not spent, decommittals and the rest.  We published a comprehensive action plan in July.  It is a rather complex programme and the projects can only be delivered from the action plan through a vote on the Estimates for each Department.

Some of the issues raised related to matters beyond the scope of the guidelines and they are now being considered as part of a wider review of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that the enforcement of animal welfare standards for all animals, including dogs, is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the Animal Health and Welfare Acts.  Both Departments work closely with each other to ensure a co-ordinated approach is taken in this area.

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is responsible for animal welfare.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is responsible for dog control and for legislation.  There has been a substantial shift in the guidelines.  Experts have emphasised the need to socialise pups by ensuring they experience the company of people before they are sold.  There have been changes in staffing levels.  As part of the move towards an increase in socialisation, pups spend more time enjoying human contact.  This is important because it helps to aid their progression when they are purchased by a family with children or by an individual.  We are examining the primary legislation and initiating public consultation on the list of restricted dog breeds.  A number of changes have been suggested by the people involved.  A number of incidents involving dogs that are not on the list of restricted dog breeds have taken place.  Consideration will be given to whether there should be a change in policy so that we have a list of dangerous dogs rather than a list of dangerous breeds.

The guidelines say that 24 hours' notice should be given, which means that those involved have a heads-up.  Even though subsequent visits are unannounced, I do not think local authorities have enough resources to make unannounced visits.  Internet sales are particularly problematic.  There were 126 dogs for sale on the Internet this morning.  Illegal sales are continuing at an alarming rate.  There were a number of tragic cases over the summer.  In May, 27 puppies were found in Scotland in a van that originated in Ireland.  In July, 16 puppies were found in a horse trailer in Galway.  They all died afterwards.  In August, over 100 dogs were rescued by the ISPCA.  Earlier this month, a man was fined over &euro;1,000 by the District Court after 37 dogs were seized from his farm.  The only penalty he received was to be banned from having dogs for 18 months.  He should not be allowed to have dogs ever again.

The Deputy has highlighted some of the atrocious cases that have made the headlines in recent times, including a case in Galway.

Over 4,500 vehicles have covered what I am told was over 100 million km since the scheme started.  As the old poem states, \"The wheels on the bus go round and round\", but unfortunately the doors of the bus open and shut.  Sometimes they are shut to many.<\/p>  <p>  Having just come from a meeting of the education committee, which was discussing this, I realise 450 special needs children are still waiting to be able to avail of this service.

Despite reviews and promises to examine the matter, the report in regard to communications could be to do better.  We are told additional staff were taken on and that 35,000 calls were made, amounting to some 1,200 per day.

It essentially has the same characteristics.  Letters of notification of withdrawal of Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus transport services to families in Redcross and Tinahely are due to what the company claims are capacity issues.  In reality, a dysfunctional management system is failing to provide adequate school transport services to students and families who are willing to pay for them.  These notices were issued in late August and, in some instances, families were not notified at all prior to the start of the school term.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Tinahely and Redcross, leaving certificate and junior certificate examination students lost their concessionary tickets even though they have been travelling on the bus for years.  The start of these important examination years is being marked by unnecessary stress caused by a system that should have a student and family based approach to service delivery.  More than 20 families received these notifications and many have no alternative method of getting their children to school in Col&aacute;iste Chill Mhant&aacute;in or Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de.  Parents are obliged to car pool, change their working hours, take time off or consider changing schools in what has turned out to be an annual farce in the school transport system.  In both of these cases, the schools that are deemed eligible do not have transport services from Redcross or Tinahely.  The pick-up point for the services are located some distance from the villages, over 4.5 km in the case of Redcross and over 3 km in the case of Tinahely, yet both villages have school transport travelling through the villages to Col&aacute;iste Chill Mhant&aacute;in and Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de.

In the majority of cases the parents are not notified until a few weeks before the beginning of term.  This places significant undue hardship on young families at what is a stressful time of the year.  A number of key areas in the school transport scheme must be addressed urgently.  The rules to determine eligibility must be changed as they are not fit for purpose.  Parochial identity is important to rural people and the current rules dismiss family traditions of attendance at a preferred school within the parish, attendance of siblings at that school and the location of after-school and extra-curricular activities with local GAA or other sports clubs, which are important for people.<\/p>  <p>  The rule stating, \"Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis\", must be scrapped.  The school transport appeals office must also be scrapped and a new system put in place, as it is totally pointless.  Since 2015, 558 appeals were made to the board, none of which was upheld, at a cost of &euro;59,700 to the taxpayer.

Fianna F&aacute;il costed this in its 2016 general election manifesto at &euro;3.2 million.  Recent research we have conducted now puts the cost at approximately &euro;4 million, which is a relatively small amount in the budgetary context.  Will the Minister of State request the funding from his colleagues in Government in advance of the budget and sort out this problem once and for all?  It is an ongoing problem every year.  The Minister of State will be aware of that because I have been raising it at this time of the year every year since he was appointed.

I concur with what has been said.  The school transport scheme in Ireland is one of the best in Europe.  We transport 117,000 children twice a day, including almost 13,000 children with special needs, in more than 4,500 vehicles covering 100 million kilometres annually at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million.  Parental contributions towards the cost of school transport is &euro;15.4 million and the State carries the rest of the cost.  We are currently transporting approximately 24,700 children who are concessionary ticket holders.  My current estimate is that 350 children are ineligible for school transport who paid by the deadline date but were unsuccessful in obtaining concessionary school transport.<\/p>  <p>  This issue must be explained in detail.  The school transport scheme was put in place for eligible children.  I did not put the scheme in place.  It was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and is a very good scheme, so this is not a criticism of Fianna F&aacute;il.  The objective of the school transport scheme was to carry every eligible child and every child with special needs to school.  Currently, every eligible child is either on a bus or getting the grant for going to school.  The scheme that has been presented to me over the past number of years is a scheme for eligible children, not concessionary children, even though the scheme carries 24,700 concessionary children.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Breathnach made a valuable point about special needs.  During the summer recess, I spent two weeks in Dublin dealing with special needs cases, which can be complex.  The Government ensures that every child with special educational needs has school transport.  Incidentally, half the school transport budget is being used to transport children with special educational needs.  I agree with that.  The transport of children with special educational needs is a specialised service.  The difficulty we have is operating it on an individual door-to-door basis.  For example, when an application is received, a vehicle and driver must be procured.  A bus escort might have to be hired and, in some instances, we are hiring two escorts for a child.  Garda vetting must be carried out.  This means it can take weeks after an application has been received before the transport can be provided.  The media have reported on some cases where there were unacceptably long delays and I have asked the officials to examine those cases.  I was not aware of them.  Representatives of Bus &Eacute;ireann will meet me in the next couple of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked that the system be changed.  I will outline the problem with that.  The budget currently stands at &euro;190 million.  To increase that budget to consider concessionary children will put us outside the legality of the system and outside the criteria laid down to carry eligible children and children with special needs.  I am aware that Deputy Aylward has been to the forefront in raising this issue.  If I had my way, I would carry every child.  However, every year we have more eligible children, more children with special needs and more concessionary children.  The current budget is extraordinary and it has increased year after year.  Again, I must point out that the emphasis of the school transport system is to carry eligible children according to the criteria laid down and to carry children with special needs.<\/p><p>All of these children are being carried.  The difficulties in respect of children with special needs, which I explained, are being worked through.  There may be a number of eligible children who were not allocated a place because of late payment.  The applications are approved in April and payment must be made by July.  Also, the payment can be made in two instalments.  The difficulty is that when payments were not received other children were accommodated on the buses.  Was I to direct Bus &Eacute;ireann to not accommodate children who had paid?  Deputies opposite would be the first to criticise me if a child who had been given a place on a bus had that place withdrawn three weeks later.  This is the difficulty with which I am faced.  I have been advised by the Department that to cater for concessionary children who are not eligible for the scheme in the first instance additional buses would be required.  If I can secure the funding to accommodate every child this year or next year I would be delighted to do so.  In my view, this might be possible in the context of the budget negotiations.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to work with me to secure the additional funding, that would make my life easier.  <\/p> <p> I know that the Deputies mean well and that they are seeking to represent their areas.

In terms of distance, Redcross is closer to Col&aacute;iste Chill Mhant&aacute;in than the designated school.  Second, every morning a 51-seat bus travels to Wicklow town via Redcross on which there are 33 students and 18 empty seats.  There are 11 children who have been discommoded under the scheme.  All we need to do is apply some common sense and allocate these children seats on the school bus to Wicklow town.  Some of the children have been attending that school for five years and are now in their leaving certificate year, which is a critical stage in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  On Tinahely, last year additional children were accommodated by way of the provision of a larger bus.

It is our job as legislators and the Minister of State's job as Minister to address problems where they arise.  There is a problem in rural Ireland in particular.  The demographics of rural Ireland have changed because during the good times more people built in rural areas, such that more children need to be accommodated by the service.  The changes that were made in 2010-11 were in response to the financial crisis.  We are out of recession, in recovery and<i>en route<\/i>to prosperous times again.  The onus is on the Minister of State to review this scheme, as he has promised over the past two years he would do, with a view to the introduction of a scheme that is fit for purpose.  As I said, the demographics of rural Ireland have changed.  Mothers and fathers now have to work.  The day of one parent going out to work and the other remaining in the home is gone.  Many people live in rural areas and they depend on the school transport system to get their children to school and we are ignoring this.  It is wrong to tell a child of the third generation - in terms of a attending a particular school - that he or she must attend a school in an area to which he or she has no connection.  It is wrong when his or her connection is to the parish school attended by the child's parents and grandparents.

Legally, we are not in a position to question parents about why their children are not taking up places on a bus or to question schools about whether a particular child is attending that school, which would mean they would have to take up a place on the bus.  We also are not in a position to question the children.  A review is under way in respect of the 18% who are not talking up places, which when completed will help us a lot.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, 117,000 are being transported to and from school on a daily basis, including 13,000 children with special needs.  The scheme is successful.  I am not suggesting that there are not cracks in the system.  Do children fall through the cracks?  Yes, of course they do.  I admit that emails are overlooked and mistakes are made which should be rectified sooner.  I am not suggesting that everything is perfect with the scheme but 99% of those availing of the scheme think it is an excellent scheme.  Since becoming Minister of State, I have endeavoured to ensure there has been no increase in the cost of this scheme, at detriment to myself in terms of my budget allocation each year.  The independent value for money review showed that the amount paid by families for the school transport scheme would be four times greater if they had to drive their children to school.  It is really good value.  <\/p>  <p>  My dilemma, and that of all other Ministers and Ministers of State, is that I am given a particular budget for the school transport scheme.  The first priority is places on buses for special needs children.  The second priority is places for eligible children.  We then address the issue of concessionary places.  This is not an easy task.  As I said, only &euro;15.4 million is paid by parents.  The remainder of the cost is met by the State and it is increasing year on year.  It was once remarked to me that the &euro;190 million being spent on school transport would be better spent on replacement of prefabs and so on.  I disagreed with that remark.  I believe the school transport scheme is great.  We need to continue to provide school transport for eligible children, including children with special needs.  There have been two reviews of the scheme already.  I have no problem with another review but it could recommend the provision of additional funding to provide for concessionary places.  Currently, children who are not eligible under the scheme are awarded places on a concessionary basis.  I will explain how this came about.  When we provided buses for a particular village, town or city and those buses were 15-seat buses but there were only ten eligible children on board, we decided that rather than have the buses operating with ten empty seats we would allocate the remaining seats on a concessionary basis.<\/p><p>We put concessionaries on it.  What happened was that concessionaries started at 700 and they are now at 24,700.  The scheme is creaking at the edges and it means that every year we have to put millions of euros into the scheme to keep eligible children and children with special needs in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500032#EE00700","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Book Sales","time":1537896600,"counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500033#FF00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1537896600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State knows, we are in the middle of a major housing and homelessness crisis which the Government is failing to address.  In the midst of all of this, the Government is complicit in the sale of mortgages by Permanent TSB.  The state is a major shareholder, owning 75% of the bank.  The bank was bailed out by taxpayers&rsquo; money to the tune of &euro;4 billion.  Permanent TSB recently sold its Project Glas loan portfolio to Start Mortgages, an affiliate of the vulture fund, Lone Star.  This portfolio contains 10,700 home loans that were originally considered by the bank to be non-performing.  Of these 10,700 home loans, 7,400 are owner-occupier mortgages and 3,300 are buy-to-let properties.  However, it has since emerged that the portfolio also includes performing loans.  We are not talking about people who have mortgages and have not paid them in ten years; we are talking about people who are genuinely paying their mortgages and have painstakingly made prior arrangements with Permanent TSB which they have adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in was opposed to this sale and we called on the Government and Permanent TSB to stop it.  The bank, being 75% State owned as well as having been bailed out by the State, should not use vulture funds to evade its responsibility to these people and nor should the Government, as its primary shareholder.  A typical example of these cases, which came to the attention of my constituency office recently, is that of a husband and wife who have resided in their house in Finglas for more than 20 years and who have their four children and a grandchild living with them.  One child is disabled.  The husband is in full-time secure employment, he has a mortgage of just over &euro;100,000, and he has an agreed amount to pay per month and is currently up to date with his repayments.  In fact, the husband has offered to increase his payment from the agreed amount to pay off what he still owes in a shorter time.<\/p>  <p>  If their house is repossessed, a family of seven, including a disabled person, will be made homeless.  This individual has had his mortgage sold to this vulture fund and it is causing him and his family great uncertainty and distress.  Based on the cases I have received representations on in my constituency office, Permanent TSB has been duplicitous in not adhering to these arrangements by agreeing to sell the mortgages to these vulture funds.  The bank said that if a borrower has agreed a restructure or an alternative payment arrangement and that they have consistently made payments in line with the terms of the restructure, then these terms will be honoured by Start Mortgages.  What guarantee do we have that Start Mortgages will honour these arrangements made with borrowers and that no one will lose their homes?  Additionally, another solution is that Permanent TSB could have looked to the local authorities to put in place a buy-to-rent scheme.<\/p>  <p>  We need answers on this.  There is a responsibility on the Minister of State and the Government to address this issue.  What has the Minister of State done to address this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500033#FF00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1537896600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Since the onset of the financial crisis, progress has been made by the banks in reducing non-performing loans, NPLs, from their peak.  NPLs at the banks in which the State has invested have reduced by approximately 70% from &euro;54 billion in 2013 to &euro;16 billion at the end of June 2018.  This reduction includes the recently announced sale of a portfolio of NPLs by Permanent TSB, namely Project Glas.  A major contributor to this progress has been the number of mortgage restructures the banks have agreed with their customers.  At the end of June 2018, almost 136,000 mortgage restructures were in place throughout the system covering private dwelling homes and buy-to-let facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the NPL ratios of the banks remain at an elevated level and are well above the European average of 4%.  Permanent TSB is a particular outlier in this regard with a ratio of 25% before the Project Glas loan sale.  Given this position, the banking regulatory authorities have tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy with the expectation that they will reduce their ratio towards the European average.  Given the scale of the reduction required, it is unfortunate but inevitable that the recently announced loan sale was a necessary action taken by Permanent TSB.  The consequences of the failure of this loan sale process would have been exceptionally serious for Permanent TSB.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that I highlight the strong protections in place for borrowers following a sale of their loans to a non-bank.  The Minister for Finance has stated on a number of occasions that the protections for borrowers in place before the sale remain unchanged after that sale.  In this regard, it is important to note that there are no changes to the rights of a borrower whose loan is sold by a bank.  All terms and conditions attached to their mortgage contract remain in place, including the terms of a restructure agreed with the bank before a sale.  Permanent TSB has further reinforced this important point and has confirmed that, if a borrower has agreed a restructure or an alternative payment arrangement and they have consistently made payments in line with the terms of the restructure, then these terms will be honoured by Start Mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that Start Mortgages is a retail credit firm regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland since 2008.  When dealing with borrowers, retail credit firms are bound by the same regulations that currently apply to Permanent TSB.  Like Permanent TSB, they are required to comply with the consumer protection code and the code of conduct for mortgage arrears when dealing with borrowers who are in arrears.  The Minister for Finance has demonstrated his own commitment to strengthening these protections further, including his support for the Bill introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath, which seeks to regulate the purchasers of mortgage loans.  In addition, earlier this year, the Minister asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the code of conduct for mortgage arrears to ensure that it remains effective.  He has asked for the report to be completed as soon as possible and the Central Bank has stated that the report will be ready at the end of this month.  If, as a result of this review, the code requires amendment, a full public consultation process will be required in line with normal guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to highlight the recent comments of Mr. Ed Sibley, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.  He said that there is no evidence that non-banks are being more aggressive in seeking a resolution than banks.  In addition, he said that loans sales are a legitimate and necessary approach for banks to address non-performing mortgage loans and, to date, there has been no material difference in the number of legal proceedings issued between banks and non-banks as a percentage of the total number of accounts in arrears.<\/p>  <p>  Separate to a loan sale, I draw the Deputy's attention to the publication of two recent financial stability reports in September by the Central Bank that highlight some key findings in terms of NPL resolution and long-term mortgage arrears.  With regard to principal private dwelling houses, the term, \"loan cure\", is used to describe the return of previously defaulted loan balances to performing loan status, and the research shows that this is the biggest driver of NPL reduction.  This reflects the success of the Government&rsquo;s supports that have been put in place over the past number of years to assist those who find themselves in mortgage arrears.  Furthermore, the paper shows that loans that go through the mortgage arrears resolution process framework are twice as likely to end up in a lower arrears state six months later, which is a positive indicator of how well this process is working and how important it is for borrowers who find themselves in difficulty to continue to engage with their bank.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding.  These decisions, including the composition of loans included in any loan sale, are the responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must run on an independent and commercial basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500033#FF00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1537896600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Minister of State heard that this sale included performing loans and Permanent TSB has admitted that.

Some of the loans are performing and people could end up homeless or out on the streets as a result of this deal.  We have no guarantee that will not happen.  We saw this with NAMA when all the properties were sold off.  It was another tragedy.  It could have helped solve the housing crisis but rental properties and private houses were sold off in large numbers.  PTSB is 75% owned by the State.  It is absolutely calamitous.  It is wrong and the Minister of State and anyone with a bit of sense knows that this does not make sense.  From the sound of it, this is a done deal.  It is done and dusted and we are now picking up the pieces.  In the future, we will pick up the pieces of some of these people who will be left on the streets.  That is what will happen.

The 2016 Herity report states that the average blue light ambulance journey time between Waterford hospital and Cork is one hour and 20 minutes.  The HSE's answers to my parliamentary questions have demolished this claim and made a nonsense of the report.<\/p><p>I appreciate the Department needs to make evidence-based decisions in the provision of health services but how can the Department continue to stand over the Herity report, especially considering its problems in terms of population calculations and the lack of consultation with consultant cardiologists at Wexford General Hospital?  The data show that not one of the 37 emergency cardiac transfers from Wexford over the past three years was completed within 90 minutes.  In the same three-year period, from the time the ambulance was called, just two patients made it from University Hospital Waterford to Cork in under 90 minutes.  The dogs in the street in the south east know this.  It is common sense.  The Department, the HSE and Dr. Herity all have access to the national ambulance service response times.  They must have been aware of the reality of these transfer times.  Did the Department look at them and was it aware of the reality of the transfer times?  <\/p><p>The Herity report estimates that approximately 175,000 people in the south east are outside the 90-minute window accessing Cork hospital and St. James's.  In the real world, the data I received via my parliamentary questions suggest that the population outside the 90-minute window is closer to 0.5 million people, which is almost the whole south-east region.  The Herity report uses a 90-minute journey time as its acute coronary syndrome, ACS, standard.  This ACS standard does not exist anywhere else.  The equivalent standard in the UK is based on 90 minutes from first responder time to balloon time, or when the patient is on the operating table.  Elsewhere in the EU, they aspire to a 60-minute transfer time.  Meanwhile for people in south Wexford and the south east, the data I received show transfers of closer to two hours.  Consultant cardiologist at University Hospital Waterford, Dr. Patrick Owens, told &quot;Prime Time&quot; that people have without doubt died <i>en route<\/i>to Dublin or Cork because they have been unable to access the service in a prompt and timely manner.  Does the Minister of State accept that statement as true?  Dr. Herity told the Oireachtas committee that 150 STEMI cases per year in the south east was needed to justify 24-7 cardiac care in the region.  I have been told that approximately 200 STEMI cases were treated in Waterford hospital in 2017.  Professor Daly, who did the 2018 ACS report, gave a figure of 203 STEMI cases to cardiologists at Waterford Hospital as a predicted outcome figure for 2017.  The Herity report does not stack up.  If one takes on board the extra time, Dr. Herity did not look at the time it takes to get to the patient.  He was only counting from the time the ambulance picked the patient up to the minute the patient got on the operating table.  We cannot ignore the fact that in Wexford on average it took an ambulance 53 minutes from request and departing Wexford hospital to St. James's or to Cork.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500034#GG02500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1537897200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of 24-7 emergency PPI cardiac care at University Hospital Waterford.

I commend the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, for his determined efforts on behalf of the people of Waterford on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Herity report of 2016 concluded that the needs of the Waterford catchment area could be met by a single cath lab but it recommended that the existing lab be staffed and funded to provide additional sessions.

This review is considering all adult cardiac service needs and their optimal service configuration as a whole.

The national review will provide a sound scientific foundation for policy making in this area from 2019 onwards.  As the Deputy will be aware from last week's meeting, the provision of 24-7 primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, services in University Hospital Waterford will be considered in the context of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.  The Deputy is also aware that the Minister is eager for a second cath lab to be operational in University Hospital Waterford to address waiting times at the hospital and provide a better service for the people of Waterford and the south east.  As confirmed at the meeting with Oireachtas Members from the south east last week, plans for a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford are now being progressed by the HSE and it will provide Members with updates throughout the process.  In conclusion, and as set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac cath labs and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally, and any decision with regard to the provision of 24-7 PPCI services in University Hospital Waterford will be informed by the outcome of the national review of specialist cardiac services, which is expected to be complete by June 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500034#GG02600","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537897800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>While the new cath lab that is to be built in Waterford is welcome, it will not make any difference in terms of helping emergency cardiac patients outside Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The meeting with the Minister last week was a decent one.  He explained to us that he has been trying to get extra hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. or 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.  That would help but it still leaves a huge window when people can need cardiac help and it is not available within 90 minutes.  That is not good enough.  He told us that the cardiac review would be finished by the end of June next year.  Does the Minister of State think it is fair in particular for the people in Wexford?  This is not parish pump politics, it just happens that they are furthest away from care.  From the time Wexford General Hospital requests an ambulance to its arrival in St. James' Hospital is an average of two hours and 30 minutes.  If someone goes to Wexford General Hospital they automatically go to St. James' Hospital.  If they go to another hospital maybe in New Ross, I do not know if people are taken in there but they can end up going to Cork.  International best practice is one hour.  Ireland is working towards 90 minutes.  It is completely unfair that a person in Wexford has to put up with two hours and 30 minutes.  The Herity report was not fair from our point of view and it was a bit of a whitewash and now we are waiting for the results of another report.  It is not fair that people have to wait for the report.  Given what we got in the Herity report, people are a bit dubious about what the next one will say.  The Government should be more proactive about anything less than 24-7 care within an hour and a half of the ambulance being first alerted, as that is only fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500035#HH00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1537897800,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I absolutely take the Deputy's point on Wexford and the south-east area, and his valid criticism.

The depth and strength of the ties between our islands, across so many areas, means that our relationship is unique.  This relationship has only been enhanced and deepened by both countries' membership of the European Union.  The complexity of the UK's departure and the scale of the challenge it presents have become even clearer in the course of the Article 50 negotiations which have been ongoing since last year.  Negotiations are led by an EU Commission task force, on behalf of the remaining 27 member states, under Michel Barnier.  Ireland's goal has always been for the EU and the UK to have the closest possible relationship post Brexit.  At the same time, it is important that we remain a member of the EU and that we maintain the integrity of the Single Market and the four freedoms on which it is based, which is the greatest strength of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to work to ensure that Ireland's issues are properly reflected in the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, including, as a priority, agreement on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, not least with regard to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, and the gains of the peace process.  This includes the need to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and to therefore agree the backstop as part of the Irish protocol.  We are also working hard to ensure that Ireland itself is ready for the changes and challenges that Brexit will bring.  Negotiations resumed on 16 August and have been ongoing continuously since then.  Substantial work has been done, and on many issues, progress has been made.  In his most recent update, Michel Barnier has reported that there is a provisional agreement on up to 90% of the text of the withdrawal agreement.  However, key, substantial issues remain to be resolved.  These include those related to Northern Ireland and the backstop.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions to agree a political declaration on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship have also begun in earnest since the resumption of negotiations.  This has been enabled by the UK's White Paper, or the Chequers proposal as we know it, on the future relationship and is being taken forward on the basis of the European Council guidelines agreed last March.  Common ground has been found on the future EU-UK security partnerships including in areas of police and judicial co-operation.  However, there are fundamental differences on the UK's suggested model for the future economic partnership, which would risk undermining the Single Market.  As we enter this final stage of talks, EU and UK negotiators have committed to bringing new energy to the talks, including on Irish-specific issues and the Government welcomes these commitments.<\/p>  <p>  EU leaders reviewed progress during the informal European Council summit held in Salzburg last week. <\/p><p>As President Tusk made clear in his remarks following the summit, all partners were agreed there will be no withdrawal agreement without a solid, operational and legally-binding Irish backstop.  Leaders reaffirmed their full support for Michel Barnier in all of his efforts and as leader of the EU task force.  On the joint political declaration on the future relationship, the leaders of the EU 27 agreed that the aim is to agree a text that provides as much clarity as possible on the future relations model.  However, leaders agreed that, despite positive elements of the UK&rsquo;s Chequers proposal, the suggested framework for economic co-operation could not work given the risks to the Single Market.<\/p> <p> The European Council meeting on 18 October remains the target to achieve maximum progress and results in the negotiations.  At that meeting, Ireland and our EU partners will then decide if conditions are sufficient to call an extraordinary summit in November to finalise and formalise the deal.  Real progress on the backstop will be an essential part of that decision.  I welcome that in her statement of last Friday in Downing Street, the Prime Minister promised that the UK will bring forward proposals on the backstop.  This needs to be done urgently if progress is to be made by the October European Council, as time is running short.  As the Taoiseach said in Salzburg, we need to redouble our efforts over the coming weeks to make sure we can successfully complete negotiations and agree a deal.  That is what we are all working towards.  Ireland, as a country, wants to avoid a no-deal Brexit.  It is important that we can reach an agreement, as all sides will suffer in a no-deal scenario - the UK, the EU and Ireland more than any other member state.  <\/p> <p> Regarding the backstop, the T&aacute;naiste met Michel Barnier last week on 18 September and discussed progress in the negotiations, and in particular the Irish protocol and the Northern Ireland Border.  Mr. Barnier confirmed once again his view that without a backstop there can be no withdrawal agreement.  He later briefed myself and my EU colleagues at the General Affairs Article 50 Council.  He gave his assessment which was and is that both sides need to work to de-dramatise the protocol and focus on agreeing the workable solutions that it offers at its core.  He set out a number of technical suggestions aimed at explaining the nature, location and modality of the controls needed in the event of the backstop being implemented.  This would maintain the key principle of the backstop, to maintain the Border as it is today - invisible - and facilitating frictionless cross-Border trade - while also minimising the technical controls needed to protect the EU&rsquo;s Single Market.  Ireland fully supports this approach and we have consistently said so. <\/p> <p> From the outset of these negotiations, the Government has been clear and consistent in our position that a Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland must be avoided under any circumstances.  While our preference would be to see these issues resolved through the future relationship, the backstop must be legally operable and, in the event that it is triggered, it must be in place unless and until another solution is found.  It cannot be temporary.  The UK has provided guarantees on avoiding a hard border and it was repeated again by Prime Minister May last Friday.  The UK is committed to a backstop.  Prime Minister May&rsquo;s indication that the UK will now bring forward proposals is welcome.  A legally operable backstop which avoids a hard border and protects the integrity of the Single Market is essential for agreeing the withdrawal agreement so as to provide the certainty that no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the future relationship, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  This is of critical importance.  The invisible border is the most tangible symbol of the peace process.  It has allowed relationships and communities to be rebuilt following years of conflict.  I do not have to tell my colleagues here that it has allowed social, political and commercial relationships to thrive across Ireland, and this cannot be put at risk<\/p> <p> It is important that we give communities in Northern Ireland and here in the South certainty that we will resolve this issue as part of the backstop agreement.  This cannot be pushed into the negotiations on the future relationship, negotiations that will not begin in detail until after the UK leaves next March and which will not be concluded for at least another two years or more.  The draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland also importantly addresses the commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, on North-South co-operation and the rights provisions of the Agreement.  North-South economic and social co-operation has benefitted people across the island and supported the development of an all-island economy.  That is something that has benefitted all parts of the community.  Protecting these gains is not just about ensuring frictionless trade but also is about facilitating peoples&rsquo; lives and livelihoods.  Similarly the rights and citizenship provisions of the agreement are at the core of the peace process and must be protected.  Fundamentally, the draft protocol works to support and protect the peace, reconciliation and prosperity that have been achieved through the Good Friday Agreement.  Mr. Barnier is well aware of this and of our position and has been strongly supportive of it throughout these negotiations and we believe he will continue to support us in this manner.<\/p> <p> The existence of the common travel area, CTA, between Ireland and Britain also plays an important role in underpinning the Good Friday Agreement in respect of both North-South and east-west co-operation.   It also of course facilitates respect for the citizenship provisions in the agreement.  Recognition of the continuance of the CTA has been agreed as part of the Article 50 negotiations and it is addressed in the draft protocol.  It is a longstanding reciprocal arrangement which predates our membership of the EU.  It is valued on both islands and its continuation is a stated objective of both the Irish and UK Governments  The latter has publicly reaffirmed this as recently as 13 September in a technical note.  We will continue to move and reside freely in either jurisdiction.  Detailed work is ongoing, both at home and bilaterally between Ireland and the UK to ensure that, irrespective of the outcome, all necessary provisions are made in order that there is no reason to expect that a no-deal Brexit - we are working to prevent that - would affect our common travel area at all.  <\/p> <p> On contingency planning, Brexit will bring real changes for Ireland.  We stand to be one of the most affected member states.  A total of 15% of Irish exports go to the UK and 11% of our imports come from the UK.  Any change to our trading relationship will have an impact on our economy and our businesses.  The nature of this will depend on the outcome of the negotiations.  We know, however, that any kind of an outcome will entail change and so we are planning accordingly.  We believe we have been responsible and measured in this approach.  Our contingency and preparedness planning for Brexit has intensified in recent months and is well advanced at this stage.  It provides a baseline scenario for the impact of Brexit across all sectors.  This includes contingency planning for a no-deal or a worst-case scenario to make sure Ireland is ready.  Co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response has been taken forward through the cross-departmental co-ordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as work at home, to help us engage actively with the European Commission's Article 50, or Brexit, task force and its Brexit preparedness unit on areas where the lead policy role lies within the EU.<\/p> <p> In respect of contingency planning for a no-deal outcome, last July the Government approved a number of Brexit preparedness measures.  This built on the extensive work that has been under way for some time.  Last week, the Cabinet approved the latest phase of this preparedness planning regarding staffing.  This included sanction for the first phase of recruitment for up to 1,000 customs and veterinary officers for our ports and airports to deal with the east-west implications.  Ministers and their Departments have identified as an early priority work in their respective Departments and this is well advanced.  We have focused on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which could result from such an outcome.  It assumes that trading relationships would be based on default World Trade Organization, WTO, rules but we also examine the possible effects on many other areas of concern.  Relevant Departments are now working on the roll-out of detailed action plans.  This is with a view to advancing, as appropriate, the mitigating measures which they have identified in the areas of their responsibility from the planning to the implementation phase.  All of this work is in addition to measures which have already been put in place to get Ireland ready for Brexit.<\/p> <p> I will finish up quickly.  In dedicated measures we have a &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme and a &euro;25 million Brexit response loan scheme.  I refer also to our capital expenditure of &euro;116 billion under the Project Ireland 2040 plan and we are also providing funding for new diplomatic missions to expand Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint, in line with our trade strategy.  We have State agencies working with companies to help them get ready for Brexit.  This is now being intensifying with the &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; campaign which was launched last week by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister, Deputy Creed.  This is a whole-of-Government communications effort, using online resources and outreach activities to build public awareness of the implications in areas such as goods and services, travel and so on, as well as the practical steps that can be taken to prepare in each case.  All of this is to try to build further awareness and to help the various sectoral audiences on the steps that are being taken by the Government, but also to assist them in being prepared. <\/p> <p> We did not ask for Brexit.  While we respect the democratic will of the British people, we regret the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave.  Our priorities remain to ensure that the terms of the departure respect the legacy of the hard-earned peace in Northern Ireland and in taking measures to minimise the impact of Brexit on citizens at home.  The challenges I have described today are considerable but we are fully committed to meeting them.  We are thankful for the support and advice received from all sides of the House on this issue.  We will continue to keep them updated and fully informed of these developments.  These issues are far-reaching and have implications for all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500035#HH00500","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537898400,"counter":403,"content":"<p>In fairness, the Minister of State read as fast as she could.  The next few weeks in the Brexit negotiations are critical.  Our citizens, business community, farmers and Members in this House are genuinely concerned that we are not in a better place at this late stage in negotiations.  We were supposed to have a withdrawal treaty finalised by 18 October and the backstop issue resolved in order that we could assure the Irish people that there will be no border on this island.  Recent events have left a nervous feeling across the board and time is not on our side.  We are continuously told about what has been agreed to date but there has been very little movement in recent months.  The key issues for Ireland remain unresolved and we appear to be at a stalemate.  We need to focus now and do everything we can from an Irish Government perspective to ensure that a deal is reached.  The alternative scenario where there is an no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for Ireland.<\/p><p>It is essential at this juncture that calm prevails.  The UK leaving the EU without an agreement is not in the interests of any party; it would cause economic harm to all concerned, particularly to Ireland.  I assume that we are still working to the 18 October deadline.  The T&aacute;naiste said the Irish issues should be resolved by that date, but it seems deadlines in this Brexit process are merely something to be casually stepped over before we move on to the next so-called deadline, which now appears to be November.<br\/><br\/>It would be most helpful if the Minister of State could outline to this House, in a serious manner, exactly where we are in these negotiations.  What does she expect will be achieved by the October meeting, if anything?  What is happening with the Irish backstop?  Are the Minister of State and the officials from her Department actually working on this?  Are negotiations going on behind the scenes with British officials, or are we simply leaving it to Mrs. Theresa May and her government to solve this issue on its own?  I would suggest that is a very risky strategy for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Negotiations are at an extremely delicate stage, and I understand that Mr. Michel Barnier is attempting to &quot;de-dramatise&quot; the backstop.  That is the buzz-phrase at the moment.  The megaphone diplomacy and celebratory tone employed by the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in the aftermath of the December agreement was a misstep, as I have said on a number of occasions.  The comments were ill-judged and premature, and we have been paying for them ever since.  &quot;We are where we are&quot; is the phrase used, but it is ten months since we were told that a backstop was agreed, and it is still not agreed.  Understandably, all communities in the North and citizens living along the Border are losing faith in the Government&rsquo;s ability to deliver on backstop to ensure we do not have a border on this island, hard or soft.  We are sailing dangerously close to the wind by allowing this issue to remain unresolved as we move towards the final stages of the negotiations.  This undoubtedly weakens our position; even if the Minister of State says it does not.  I believe it does.  The impression was given at our last stakeholder meeting that something was happening on the backstop behind the scenes and that we were more or less there, but in Salzburg that seemed to evaporate in a matter of minutes, with Theresa May saying she did not think the UK would have anything on the backstop by the October meeting.  When we, as Opposition spokespersons, attend these meetings we do so in good faith so we can engage with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, ask questions and get a serious update.  However, this side of the House does not feel properly informed or briefed by the Government, and there is little information from those meetings that I cannot read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It is often said that the Government wants and needs the support of the Opposition, but I think it has been given a fair degree of latitude in that respect.  That latitude must be reciprocate by the Government's side, by informing this House what exactly it is doing and where we are with these negotiations.  If people are kept in the dark they will inevitably fill in the blanks themselves.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister of State said, Ireland is the most vulnerable member state in these negotiations.  Without a doubt, we stand to be most affected by Brexit, regardless of the type of Brexit that emerges.  With in the region of &euro;1 billion of trade weekly between Ireland and the UK, it is by far our largest market and trading partner, and I think some in the Government need to be reminded of this.  More than 50% of our beef, more than 70% of our dairy and more than 70% of our timber products go to the UK.  These are among a number of sectors that stand to be seriously impacted by Brexit.  Even before we deal with additional tariffs - if they apply when the UK becomes a third country - there are the expected delays with new customs procedures and delays at the ports in Dublin, Dover and Calais, all of which impact on the cost of trade.  One can image the impact of a delay of two days in the transit of produce if that produce is perishable, for example, mushrooms or cheese.  All of a sudden the delivery of those products is called into question.  The immediate impact of a no deal or bad deal Brexit would be the fluctuation in currency between the pound and the euro, which we saw when the referendum took place.  This can severely impact cashflow overnight.  We have to bear all of this in mind when we sit at the Brexit negotiating table.<br\/><br\/>I want to acknowledge the fantastic work being done by Enterprise Ireland, which I met with earlier today, in helping Irish companies to prepare for Brexit and to diversify their markets.  It is welcome to see that exports to the UK as a percentage of total exports have fallen over the last ten years.  We are gradually reducing our dependence on that market, but we will always need and want to trade with our closest neighbour.  A good working relationship and the ability to trade as freely as possible with the UK post-Brexit is absolutely essential.  Another area of great concern is haulage and the delivery of goods to and from this country.  The Irish Haulage Association has outlined its concerns that around 70% of its drivers are from eastern Europe.  They are driving Irish trucks, but they will not be covered by the common travel area.  Will these workers, who are driving Irish trucks and helping to stock the shelves in our supermarkets and pharmacies across Ireland, need special work permits?  What work has been done behind the scenes to deal with that particular issue?  In fairness, the issue has been highlighted at length.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of our domestic preparedness, which the Minister of State touched on in her speech, it might surprise her to know that my party submitted a number of freedom of information, FOI, requests to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to try to get some information on the preparations for a no deal or hard Brexit which have been carried out, and about the hiring of inspectors.  Those FOI requests were refused.  We appealed the refusal, and it was refused again.  What kind of approach is that to take?  If we are all working together on the same team and the Government wants the support of the Opposition parties, and it is preparing for all eventualities, surely it would want us to know about it.  Perhaps the Minister of State can look into that matter and consider whether those records can be released to my party.<br\/><br\/>The Dutch Government announced at the start of the year that it would hire 750 new customs officers.  It completed the hiring of 1,000 new customs officers in early July and is now training those people.  We are in the process of hiring around 400 customs officers.  Ireland and the Netherlands have similar levels of trade with UK.  This is one area where we can do better to prepare.  We should be better prepared because Brexit will affect Ireland more than any other member state.<br\/><br\/>I want to touch on what happened in Salzburg last week.  The informal summit revealed that there is still a substantial chasm between the EU and UK negotiation teams, and it was a pity that the summit was used to provoke rather than persuade.  It was most regrettable that the whole affair went so badly; it set the negotiations back.  It was an informal summit and nobody was expecting a major breakthrough or for Brexit to be solved in its entirety, but equally we were not expecting it to descend into such bitterness.  The optics of that summit were not good for Ireland.  Our Taoiseach was seen across media in Ireland and the UK strolling side by side with the French President, who gave a considerable kick to Theresa May at that summit.  The British Prime Minister, rightly or wrongly, went home feeling as though she had been ambushed, and the British media loudly declared that she had been humiliated by the EU 27 the next day.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, he appeared on the BBC that night in what I believe was a damage limitation exercise.  He did quite a good interview, and reminded the British people and the UK Government that we are still neighbours and that we still want to trade and work with them, and that we very much want them to make a deal.  That was the correct thing to do, and necessary considering the events in Salzburg that day.<br\/><br\/>Britain needs our help.  It is one thing to enjoy beating England at soccer or other sporting events, but at the end of the day, a triumphalist approach is not going to serve our interests either.  If the UK crashes out, it will be extremely bad for us, to put it mildly.  We need the UK to get a deal.  We should be using our influence at that negotiating table to ensure there is a good deal for Ireland, the UK and the EU as a whole.<br\/><br\/>We need serious focus now on getting a deal delivered for our citizens, North and South, and for citizens across the EU.  We need less spinning from Government, less focus on PR and more focus on getting the job done.  Not every meeting has to be tweeted or the stage set for every engagement.  The Government should be aware of the optics, because they matter; we do not necessarily have to damage relationships between ourselves and the UK.  It is extremely important that the relationship, which is under pressure, is worked on.  Every Minister in government should be meeting regularly with his or her counterpart in the UK.  We need to see some concrete proposals as to what exactly that future engagement is going to look like post-Brexit, and what type of mechanism or system will be in place to ensure we have regular contact with our counterparts across the water.  <br\/><br\/>Brexit was not of our making or of our choosing, and the main focus now must be on protecting Ireland&rsquo;s interests and reaching agreement on the terms of the withdrawal arrangement.  We must also reach agreement on the backstop to ensure there is no hard border on this island, which would run contrary to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  Cool, calm heads are required.  I hope that the Salzburg summit focused minds and provided time for reflection.  Both sides must now come to the table to ensure that the most vulnerable in our societies are protected.  While nobody wants to see a no deal, crash out Brexit, it is possible, and we may sleepwalk into it if we do not act with a renewed focus in order to get that deal done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500036#JJ00200","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537899000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>We are approaching the end game.  In order to judge this Government on what it has achieved we have to go back to almost the start of the process.  At the start of the process, this Government and the European Union promised that the Irish issues would be resolved before moving on from phase one of the negotiations.  There were a number of elements in that phase, including the divorce agreement and issues around trade, but the Irish issue was crucial.<\/p><p>There was a fudge, of course.  We moved on from phase one into phase two and the Irish issues have been fudged ever since.  We had a political agreement last December that was hailed as a cast-iron guarantee by the Taoiseach and oversold by the Government at the time.  We cautioned it not to do so.  We were then told we would have a legal text by March.  March came and went and there was no legal text.  We had a legal text from the European Union.  The EU put its position on the table; it was rejected out of hand by the British Government.  June was to be the new deadline.  June came and went and still no agreement emerged.  We were told that October would be the new deadline.  Now it seems October will come and go, and we still will not have agreement.<\/p> <p> I am a bit perplexed by the Fianna F&aacute;il position.  That party seems to want to wrap Prime Minister Theresa May up in cotton wool.  It says that if only we were nicer to Theresa May we might have got a better outcome.  That is a very naive position.  The reality is that this Tory Government forced Brexit on the Irish people.  It is the same Tory Government that is ignoring the will of the people in the North who voted to stay in the European Union.  It is the same Tory Government that has created chaos around Brexit.  It has no plan and no strategy.  It did not care one jot about the Irish people before the referendum, during the referendum or, as we have seen, after the referendum.  That has been the sad reality of the British Tory Party.  It is divided, but it is divided as to its own interests.  A war within the Tory Party is being played out and it is having devastating consequences for the Irish people.  I am not in any mood to give any protections to a British Prime Minister who has failed in her obligations and her responsibility to come up with the proposals that she needs to come up with.<\/p> <p> There are so many contradictions in this that it is hard to make sense of it and understand what is happening.  A British Prime Minister has promised there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and to protect citizens' rights.  She also says that she does not want a border in the Irish Sea or to divide her country.  She is talking about the United Kingdom; I will not go into the irony there.  However, in the same breath she says that she will take the North out of the customs union and Single Market.  That is going to happen.  How can we avoid a border on the island of Ireland and a border in the Irish Sea if Britain and the North leave the customs union and the Single Market?  It simply cannot happen and everybody knows it.  We have had this fantasy politics, this absolute nonsense from the Tory Party for far too long.  At some point the British Government is going to have to put its solutions on the table.  It is going to have to explain to people how it will square that circle, having told the Irish people it can avoid a hardening of the Border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a border in the sea.<\/p> <p> What we know is that we had an agreement last December.  As a political agreement, it certainly ticked a lot of boxes, with the North staying in the customs union and elements of the Single Market.  It was not ideal.  It was imperfect and needed to be built on, shaped, nurtured and negotiated in detail to give us a product  we could see as a solution for Ireland.  It was also meant to be a permanent solution in the event that something better did not come along.  That was what the backstop was meant to be.<\/p> <p> There are two sets of negotiations.  There is the negotiation on the withdrawal agreement, which has to be in place by March.  The backstop has to be attached to that.  Further to that there is the separate future trading relationship, which will work itself out as part of the implementation period which will be in place for a year.  However, the backstop was meant to mean that whatever happened in the future trading relationship talks, at the very least Ireland would have this guarantee.  Not for a week, a month or a year; it was to be a permanent solution.<\/p> <p> However, this is an evolving situation.  The British Government now wants to make that a temporary solution.  It obviously wants to keep the DUP on board.  It wants whatever is in play for the North to apply to Britain as a whole, but it obviously does not want to be in the position of saying that the North and Britain will stay in the customs union and the Single Market.  These games are being played out.  There are all sorts of nuances and considerations.  I accept that the British Prime Minister has a difficult job in managing her party and bringing some of the hard Brexiteers with her.  That is fine, but she has had an awfully long time to do it.  We are now coming to the crunch and when we come to the crunch we will need to see product and solutions, but we still have not seen them.<\/p> <p> I was always on the optimistic side of this issue.  I always believed that we would get a deal.  I am still on the optimistic side because we need one.  If there is no withdrawal agreement then there is no protocol for Ireland.  There is no backstop.  If there is no withdrawal agreement the United Kingdom, including the North, will crash out of the European Union.  That means a hard border.  It means real challenges to the Good Friday Agreement.  A no-deal scenario is an absolute disaster for the people of Ireland.  I would argue that it is also an absolute disaster for the people of Britain and the European Union.  For that reason, logic would say that there has to be a deal.  However, we have seen logic thrown out the window so many times on Brexit that it is hard to know.  I still believe that there will be some arrangement.<\/p> <p> Our fear is that at the eleventh hour something will be put on the table that will be less than what we were promised in December.  It might be a time-limited backstop, or one that does not have the provisions we want to protect against a hard border or protect the Good Friday Agreement.  The Irish Government will be bounced because the neither British Government nor the European Union will move, and we will end up in a difficult situation.  That is what we are trying to avoid.  That is why all of this was to be tied up last March, and then in June, and now in October.  It is a real worry that all of these dates are coming and going.<\/p> <p> We never sought, as some Ministers have said, to make this an orange or green issue.  Our position is very clear.  The voters in the North must be respected.  They voted to stay in the European Union.  We are seeking special status for the North so that it can stay in the European Union.  We want a deal.  We are not planning for a no-deal scenario.  Obviously, if it happens, we must have contingency plans but we are not hoping for it.  We do not want it.  We want a deal.  We want a solution because the lack of one will have such a devastating impact on the people that we represent on either side of the Border.<\/p> <p> If the British Government continues with its strategy of not considering Ireland and not putting solutions in place and if we get to a point in March where there the UK crashes out of the European Union, then from the point of view of everyone who believes in Irish unity or believes that the island of Ireland should stay as a unit in the European Union, it is reasonable to think there should be a Border poll.  I do not think that is an unfair proposition.  It would be a very fair one.  All the opinion polls are showing that in the event of a no-deal scenario, a hard Brexit and a crash more people in the North, including some unionists, will support a united Ireland.  I wish to put that on the table.<\/p> <p> We have taken some flak for supporting the Government on this, but we never saw it as supporting the Government.  We see it as supporting an Irish position.  We see it as supporting an Irish outcome and getting the best deal for the people that we all collectively represent, the people of Ireland, North and South.  That is our absolute priority.  However, the Minister must understand our perspective.  There are shifting deadlines, divisions in the Tory Party and contradictory statements coming from Theresa May.  Only last week after the Salzburg statement she reiterated that there will be no solution that creates a border in the Irish Sea, as if that is what the people of Ireland are looking for.  It is as if we are all jumping up and down, demanding a border in the Irish sea.  The only people who will put a border in the Irish Sea are in the British Government.  It is not an objective of the Irish Government, the European Union or Sinn F&eacute;in.  The way to avoid a border in the Irish Sea is for Britain as a whole, not just the North, to stay in the customs union and elements of the Single Market, or for some sort of free trade agreement to be worked out.  Such an agreement is being called a \"customs arrangement\".   There are solutions and there are possibilities.  The problem is that we are arriving at the eleventh hour and we have not seen them.  That is not a good position for us to be in at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500037#KK00200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537899600,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Approximately a week ago, the UK Labour Party's spokesperson on Brexit, Mr. Keir Starmer, MP, addressed an all-party meeting in the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>He quoted part of what he wrote in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in which he stated:<\/p><blockquote>More of the same simply will not do.<br \/><br \/>We need a fresh approach, one that recognises it is only through a combination of a new customs union, a strong single market deal and shared institutions that we find a solution that works for Ireland, the UK and across the EU.<\/blockquote><p>Very few of us would disagree if that were to be the outcome but, to be honest, it is typical of the type of magical thinking that is going on.  When we spoke to Mr. Starmer about it, he said that in effect the day after, or some period after, Britain has left, it would immediately sit down with the 27 member states, individually or collectively and collectively would be the desire, to hammer out a deal to provide for the customs union and the Single Market.  The magical thinking is that this is what Britain has at present through its membership of the European Union.  It found that in a referendum the people said they wanted to leave the Union.  In recent days, we have had a lot of evidence that the campaign by various British newspapers for a second referendum to support remaining in the EU has gathered pace.  At the British Labour Party conference, a significant proportion of delegates appear to favour this.  There certainly has been political movement in the UK as the perception begins to dawn on what it might mean, with some scary scenarios been painted even by Tory supporting tabloid newspapers that it could mean miles of queues to the ports on the English Channel, a shortage of medicines, which are imported and exported through various countries in the Union, and other impacts.<br\/><br\/>The fact is that members of the Government have come home from Salzburg with hope in their hearts but their hands are empty.  Being involved in a negotiation is drawn-out process.  One does not get the answer all at once.  The EU has well-established customs and practices, which mean that as we near the witching hour of having to make a decision, the Heads of State are in the room, and the other Heads of State gather recalcitrant members around to persuade them that in the greater good they have to act in a particular way.  Herein lies a genuine problem for Ireland and an enormous problem for the Government.  Everybody is apprehensive about any rebuilding or reincarnation of the Border as we knew it.  Anything such as this would be very difficult for people in Ireland to swallow and would also put in danger the huge dividends, difficult and all as the earning of those have been, of the Belfast Agreement and the peace process.<br\/><br\/>Earlier in the summer, and other people in the Chamber may have seen it also, I went to see the film &quot;Munich&quot;, which is based on Robert Harris's novel about 1938.  In it, Chamberlain brought back what was described as &quot;peace in our time&quot;.  Clearly, the Taoiseach is trying to bring back a Brexit agreement in our time.  As was said about Czechoslovakia and the Sudetenland Germans at the time, it was a faraway country about which people knew little.  For many people in Vienna or Berlin, those places feel like the centre of Europe, and geographically they are.  Naturally, we in Ireland are the centre of our own world but we have to ask ourselves what exactly is the view of the 27 member states.  Excellent diplomatic work has been done to keep the 27 member states together and to negotiate under Mr. Barnier's direction as a single force but the Government cannot deny that at this point in time, we should have the shape of an agreement.  The Taoiseach arrived back in a way that is a reminder of that period in European history, with papers in his hands stating he had a bullet-proof backstop.  This part of the conversation has to be about exploring what exactly that now means.  The answer, hopefully, is that it could mean an awful lot but, in a negative outturn, it could mean extraordinary difficulties for us.<br\/><br\/>The meeting last week was attended by many people from the Border counties and several from the North of Ireland.  Anybody who knows the Border knows its complexity and its extreme porousness, with hundreds of formal and informal crossings, and knows that just occasionally having a friendly customs official ten miles south or north of Dundalk is not a runner.  I plead with the Minister of State to share with us the Government's concept of what this would look like.  The Revenue Commissioners have told us they are ready to take on the required staff.  Is there a partial IT-based solution?  Of course there would be over a period of three to five years but the IT has to be developed.  Logistics in Ireland are not as developed as they are in many other countries because we are at the end of a long run.  If the discussion here is to be of any use, the Minister of State needs to share with us how she and the Government propose to address the issue of the Border.<br\/><br\/>We must bear in mind that both communities in the North recognise they benefit enormously from the effective disappearance of the Border as it once was, and this is often forgotten.  Except for those who take a political view, most people North of the Border, and certainly people in the Unionist camp whom I have met, would like the Border to continue as it now.  Ports and airports are the easiest way to do this and, of course, ports and airports have an accepted customs and police presence.  Will the Minister of State paint a picture of what she anticipates happening?  Going back to Keir Starmer's simple and honest remarks about a new customs union, a strong Single Market and shared institutions, the issue for us is how we get these.  In a certain sense, a two-year extension which, like everybody else, I assume would work for the full two years, would give us additional time but, nonetheless, we need a legal agreement.  Britain has voted.  The first day after the result of the referendum I said I would love the British people to have an opportunity to reconsider their position, as we did on several occasions.<\/p><p>There are many ultra-left people in Ireland who do not like the European Union but the Union has been one of the great modernising forces in Ireland in terms of employment, women's rights, disability rights and environmental concerns.  I will close by again saying that I am not getting what the Government's suggested solution is to this difficulty.  The Minister of State must share her confidence with the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500038#LL00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537900800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I will be sharing time with Deputy Mick-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500040#NN00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1537900800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500040#NN00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1537900800,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I apologise.

It is the Europe that supposedly came together after the Second World War to ensure peace and an end to war, and to ensure that France or Germany would never again create war at the cost of millions of lives.  It was to ensure that fascism and authoritarianism would never again take root.  They want a Europe that sets standards for the environment, women, workers and measures that could act as a balance to the free market drives across Europe while delivering fairness.  It is a Europe that is synonymous with Beethoven's composition, \"Ode to Joy\".  When most people react positively to Europe, it is to that idea of Europe, which is the concept of a commonality cutting across barriers of nationality, removing distinction and giving people the right to travel freely across borders.  It is typified in something as simple as the common currency.  This idea of Europe - a progressive, liberal and pro-worker Europe - is one I argue is and has always been more of a myth than reality.<\/p>  <p>  If we saw rules and regulations in the past that changed and removed barriers for people or set standards that were good, it is worth understanding that this was not the purpose of the regulation or the change but rather it was often a by-product of the real aim of the European Union.  The Common Market was not necessarily a progressive liberal goal but rather the goal of big business and a corporate Europe that in the 1980s feared the demise of profits and business.  It saw that only by pooling markets together could the entities survive and compete in international business and a globalised economy, with one big market able to face up to the United States, Japan or China.  That is the motivational force behind European unity, which is, above all, unity of big business and the European round table of industrialists that remains the single most influential force in lobbying Europe and its Commission.  With other business groups, it remains the guiding force behind the regulation and rules that govern Europe today.<\/p>  <p>  This European round table has the biggest and most profitable companies, including the chief executives of Volvo, Philips, Nestl&eacute;, Nokia, BAE Systems and Airbus.  Europe is made and shaped in their interests and not on the instincts or in the interests of ordinary citizens of Europe.  If we get the right to travel without borders and with a single currency, it is only because it serves the interests of those businesses and not for any lofty ideals of commonality.  It is they who set the benchmark for every policy and goal of competitiveness, fiscal restraint, etc., in what the State can spend.  It is why when we debate closures of post offices in Ireland and cuts to bus and health services, as well as the outsourcing of health, it is often the European rules that demand we tender out those services and allow private multinationals to win the awards.<\/p>  <p>  The Europe formed after the Second World War was supposed to be a response to militarism but it has now become one of the leading sources of arms and military hardware across the world.  It is a Europe of permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and military units that can be deployed across the globe for so-called humanitarian missions when in reality it is there to ensure and continue to defend the reach and scope of the interests of former colonial powers.  This is a Europe of 30,000 paid lobbyists, the majority of whom are corporate and big business lobbyists who help influence the rules on which the European Parliament votes.<\/p>  <p>  The real Europe is that of the savagery inflicted on the Greek people.  The real Europe is that of the savagery inflicted on the Irish people by shoving a bailout of &euro;64 billion of toxic debt from French and German banks down our throats.  Despite the catastrophe of the financial crash and the crisis leading from it, that same Europe has not learned its lessons.  We want to see a Europe that will never again witness fascism or war but instead we are getting the opposite.  We are seeing the rise of fascism across Europe, with fascists knocking on the doors of parliaments and a real confusion about what sort of world in which we want to live.<\/p>  <p>  For us and our Brexit negotiations, the bottom line is there should be no hard border in this country.  Therefore, there should be no co-operation with a hard border; for example, there should be no employment of customs officials or garda&iacute;, etc., and we should totally resist the implementation of that hard border in Ireland.  It is not the interests of Brussels or London but those of ordinary people across Europe and in Ireland that should come first.  The Government should reflect that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500040#NN00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1537900800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>One week ago Mrs. Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, arrived in Salzburg with a hardline message for her European Union counterparts.  She was sent home with an equally hardline message from the other 27 leaders.  Agreement on the terms of a Brexit now seem as far away as ever.  Understandably, many in Ireland are fearful of the consequences of Brexit, the possibility of a hard border and the rise of sectarian tensions that may result.  They are fearful that the burden of a Tory Brexit may be placed on the shoulders of working people in the form of job losses, wage cuts, etc.<\/p>  <p>  To understand the meaning of recent events, it is necessary to restate certain truths.  The EU is an institution designed to smooth co-operation between Europe's various capitalist and corporate elite in the interests of those elite.  It has introduced a series of fiscal rules that write neoliberal policies into law, promote widespread privatisation and engineer a race to the bottom in terms of worker rights and conditions.  For example, these rules seriously restrict the ability of the State to address an unprecedented housing crisis without breaking those rules.<\/p>  <p>  The cheerleaders for the European Union, including many in this Chamber, trumpet the supposed benefits of the EU but the impoverished pensioners of Greece know the reality.  The railway workers of Britain who have resisted EU-mandated attacks on their terms and conditions and have been to the fore in making a left case for Brexit know this.  The Brexit negotiations represent a clash of interests between the rival capitalist elite.  There is nobody at the negotiations representing the interests of ordinary working people.  That includes the representatives of the Irish Government, including Fine Gael Ministers who have helped rigged the economy against working people and taken no effective action against the housing crisis.  Nevertheless, they pose as the people's champions on the international stage.<\/p>  <p>  The organised working class movement must take an independent stance on Brexit.  First and foremost, the trade unions must firmly resolve that working people will not be made the whipping boys and girls.  There must be strong resistance organised to any threat of redundancies or pay cuts.  The working class movement must stand for a completely different type of Europe, a socialist Europe that serves the needs of the many rather than the greed of the few.  Precisely because we fight for the rights of all working people, we oppose any hardening of the Border between North and South and the introduction of any infrastructure that impedes freedom of movement.  We also oppose any restrictions being brought in between the North and Britain.  Both Catholic and Protestant working class people in the North are at one with ordinary people in this State in opposing any hardening of the border and we stand with them.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn won major support at the polls for left policies, including the ending of tuition fees, the building of 500,000 council homes and the nationalisation of energy, rail and mail, as well as the creation of a state investment bank.  Not a single one of these policies could be implemented within the framework of a Single Market or capitalism.  There is now a real possibility of Mrs. May's Government collapsing and a general election in the UK this autumn.  The Socialist Party and Solidarity would welcome this and the return of a Corbyn-led Labour Government.<\/p><p>If Mr. Corbyn forms a Government in the coming months and implements his programme, it would echo right across Europe.  It would raise the sights of people that instead of a choice between an anti-democratic, austerity driven EU and a bargain basement Tory exit, a struggle for a socialist Europe could be posed.  It could give an impetus to the building of new parties of the working class across Europe as well as the need for working people across Europe to stand together and take joint action against the attacks of big business and its representatives.<\/p> <p> It could pose the election of left, socialist governments as part of a struggle for a new, socialist Europe, with working people united in opposition to the big business elites that play with our futures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500040#NN00700","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537901400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Jackie Cahill and Robert Troy.<\/p>  <p>  The clock is ticking.  There are 185 days to go.  I am tinged with a certain sadness at the prospect of any reintroduction of a Border, either hard or soft, when it has, for all intents and purposes, been removed.  That tinge of sadness also creates a certain madness at the futility of two islands on the periphery of Europe harming each others economies and people.  I have said in this House on a number of occasions that I am old enough to have seen how my county and the Border region fared before the EU.  I am also old enough to have seen the benefits of joining the European Union both north and south of the Border.  I am old enough to remember when we did have some peace before 1969 and the benefits that accrued from the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I am also involved long enough in cross-Border and east-west participation as a public representative in this House to see the futility of putting those relationships that have been created, North-South and east-west, in jeopardy.  I come from the smallest county in Ireland but it has had the greatest impact on issues of division and divisiveness.  Three members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were assassinated in more recent times as part of that division and divisiveness.  We all know that any vacuum creates a volatility and uncertainty in the Border region in trade and commerce and in our communities.  Although some people describe it as scare-mongering we should be under no illusions.  There is a possibility of a return to the bad old days.  The extreme paramilitaries are watching closely and hoping for Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  I have had discussions with senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as has the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.

That agreement went on to outline the backstop arrangements that would allow full alignment between north and south in the future.  The news has emerged in the past week that the EU is preparing to accept a frictionless Irish Border using technological solutions.  That is alarming.  That is maximum facilitation, max fac, and has already been rejected by the Government.  A lot of businesses do not seem keen on this option because of the higher costs.  Deputy Chambers alluded to the Irish Road Haulage Association which clearly described that a one-hour delay in the movement of a truck equates to a cost of &euro;15 per tonne on that truck.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to act now and come down hard on any change to December's agreement.  While Michel Barnier has never wavered in his position of insisting on a backstop, the practicalities of any proposed technological solution need to be ironed out so that Border checks will be avoided.  The Minister of State lives close enough to that Border and is all too aware of the issues.

There is concern among many in the sector that the Government is overly reliant on the fact that a hard Brexit is too big to happen.  One hopes that a deal will be done by the 11th hour.  A hard Brexit will ensure that trade is governed by the WTO and it will ensure the introduction of tariffs, customs and the reintroduction of administrative supports.  I compliment the ports which have carried out the necessary infrastructural improvements to cater for a hard Brexit.  Earlier this summer, the Government confirmed that it approved the recruitment process.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine prepared to carry out all inspections on live animals, foods and plants?  I expect a reply to that question.  How many posts have been filled as of today?  How many posts have been advertised and when will they be filled?<\/p>  <p>  Aviation is a critical sector for a small island nation.  We currently have market access through the open skies policy.  Earlier this year, Taskforce 50 of the European Commission announced a bare bones contingency plan for fallout from the open skies policy.  Has any flesh been put on the bare bone contingency plans to avoid flight disruptions post March 2019?  What is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, doing to ensure the third and fourth freedoms codified by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, will be invoked to ensure that, post March 2019, travel between the EU 27 and the UK will be maintained?<\/p>  <p>  Safety regulation is sometimes not acknowledged or spoken about, but parts from many Irish aircraft currently come from the UK and they will not be valid if there is a hard Brexit.  We need to ensure that there is mutual recognition between our safety standards.  If there is not, the parts that keep our aircraft in the skies until the end of March 2019 will not be recognised after that.  What work is being done to ensure that there is mutual recognition of safety standards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500041#OO00300","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1537901400,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I will make a few points about the agrifood sector.  Agriculture is under economic pressure and primary producers are finding it extremely hard to survive.  A hard Brexit scenario sends a shiver up the spine.  The predictions are that by 2030 if Britain chooses to join the European economic area after Brexit, Ireland will lose 15% of its exports to the UK.  That number increases to 31% if it falls back on WTO rules.<\/p>  <p>  The beef sector will probably be the hardest hit sector.  Some 35% of our trade will be lost if WTO rules apply.  It is impossible to imagine that scenario.  If WTO rules apply to the dairy sector, Ireland will lose 40% of its trade.<\/p><p>The UK is obviously our nearest customer and we are greatly dependent on it.  Think of our processing industry under a hard Brexit.  Consider the level of cross-Border trade.  Each week 1,500 milk lorries cross the Border to be processed here.  There is talk of different food standards operating in Northern Ireland compared with the Twenty-six Counties under a hard Brexit.  We must consider the practicalities of how that will work and the economic hardship that they will bring.  We have discussed Brexit for some time but the harsh reality of the economic damage is really coming home.  It is hard to envisage how the family farm structure as we know it will survive under a hard Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500041#OO00400","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537902000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I now call on Members from the Rural Independent Group.

Brexit will have many implications for Ireland, some of which we can predict and others we cannot.  One thing that is sure is that there will be many challenges ahead for Ireland and it is vital that during the Brexit negotiations we steer through these waters with a clear vision of what Brexit will mean to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We need to pay particular attention to the agricultural sector.  Ireland is greatly dependent on it and exports almost 70% of its agricultural produce to Britain.  It is vital that during the Brexit negotiations our agricultural produce being exported to Britain are protected.  Britain is a very serious market for Irish agriculture, especially for dairy and beef produce.  For export markets we need to maintain strong competitive transport links with the rest of the EU in order to secure Ireland's economic future.  Some two thirds of Irish exporters use the UK landbridge to access Europe.  Brexit will have a huge effect on Ireland's ability to use this route for exports.  We need to look now at negotiating transports routes.  Coming from west Cork, I know only too well how important our ports are to us and to the export economy.  My own constituency has ports such as Bantry Bay, Castletownbere and Kinsale, and their futures need to be secured.  I plead with this Government to support these ports through the uncertain times ahead with Brexit on the horizon.<\/p>  <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, needs to be protected post-Brexit.  We need to look at this and put provisions in place.  Our fishermen have suffered very difficult times in recent years.  It is vital that we protect their livelihoods.  There is serious danger of greater numbers of European boats fishing in Irish waters after Brexit.  We need to protect our waters and our fishermen.<\/p>  <p>  The cross-border directive is very important for the people of Ireland.  To date, we have sent 14 buses from Cork and Kerry to Belfast with people who have availed of cataract procedures through the cross-border directive.  These people could have waited for anything up to five years if they could not have availed of this directive.  During the negotiations, we must ensure that our cross-border directive is protected with Northern Ireland and Britain.  This also includes agreement for cancer patients travelling from Donegal to Derry and small children travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for operations.  There are many agreements that must be protected for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Upset constituents have approached me.  They fear for their uncertain futures and those of Irish citizens living in the UK.  One case is of an Irish citizen living in the UK who married in Ireland almost ten years ago.  They lived in Ireland for a year afterwards with their spouse and they now live in the UK.  Their spouse is a non-EU citizen who had lived in Ireland for two years prior to their marriage - as well as one year afterwards - but because they had not lived three years reasonable residence out of the last five years, they will not be able to obtain an Irish passport.  This family is frightened that they could be split up as a result of Brexit.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  No Irish citizen living in the UK should have to live with this fear.  We must also ensure that there will be freedom of movement between ourselves and our neighbours.<\/p>  <p>  Our negotiations must also deal with what will happen to Irish students studying in UK colleges.  Clearly Brexit will have a huge effect on Ireland and we now need to step up to the challenges that lie ahead for our country and put in place the provisions that will deal with these challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500042#PP00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1537902000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>It is clear that this is a very delicate moment in the negotiations for the UK's withdrawal from the EU and we are right in the middle of it.  It is no exaggeration to say that the two most important international relationships that Ireland has are with the EU and its members and with the United Kingdom.  One is the primary partnership we have chosen for our future and the other is our closest neighbour that has picked a different future for itself.<\/p>  <p>  Many British citizens have voted to leave the EU as they believe it will allow them to take better control of their futures.  I am not going to comment on whether they are right or wrong but I will say that we in Ireland know that membership of international rule-based organisations is the best way to build international relationships and for countries to support each other.  Maybe we know this to be true more quickly as a small country, that it is a big, complex and volatile world out there and I imagine it can be very cold on one's own.  The support we have achieved from our European friends and partners in the negotiations has been unwavering.<\/p>  <p>  The Border presents a paradox and serious challenge and solving it is still urgent.  The issues being raised by the various solutions being proposed are core to many people's sense of identity.  It looks as though emotions are heightened more than ever.  It would be easy to get caught up in who is right or wrong and who said what but at this time we need to put all that aside and remain steadfast in our ambition to come to a good, fair agreement with the United Kingdom that mitigates as much as possible the inevitable damage that will come.<\/p>  <p>  Sometimes it feels as though our fellow British parliamentarians do not fully understand the consequences of some of what they are suggesting for this island so it is important to keep talking and explaining.  For example, Keir Starmer was in Dublin a couple of weeks ago, when he spoke to Members of these Houses and others.  He appeared before the committee I chair and we had a very meaningful discussion, of which the Minister of State will be aware.  I will not say that his speech today was based on those interactions, but it shows all of us why we must keep talking to one another.<\/p>  <p>  As the competitors at last week's ploughing championships know, when one ploughs a field the most important thing to get right is the first furrow, and to get that straight.  A ploughman tracks the wheels into the first furrow.  If that first furrow is crooked, there is no fixing it.  One could repeat the mistake for the whole field.  To find a solution that works for the Border is the first furrow in the withdrawal agreement.  I have always found the best thing to do is to pick a fence or tree at the end of the field and keep an eye on it all the way.  Do not waver, do not look down or up, do not look left or right but keep going in a straight line.<\/p>  <p>  We are in uncharted waters.  On behalf of the joint committee, I remind the Minister of State that we fully support her in the work she has been doing.  She has been very workpersonlike in appearing before the committee at all times.  She has made herself available and I could not find any fault in how she is carrying out her role, and it is a difficult role at this time.  I have said it on record before, and I would say if it was otherwise, but it is no harm to recognise a person when they are committed to doing the best that they can do.  We are all in this together.  This debate tonight is important.  We need to keep talking and keep the people on the other side of the water talking too, to try to make them understand the complications we face in dealing with the mess that they have made for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500042#PP00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1537902000,"counter":424,"content":"<p>We are approaching the most crucial, critical time in the State's history in terms of how the people of Ireland will survive or manage if Brexit becomes a reality.  I was the first person in this Chamber after the result of the referendum became known to ask the then Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste to plead with the UK to have another referendum.  I am still asking for that and many people around the country hope that at the last minute, they will hold another referendum and that the result would be to remain.<\/p>  <p>  For farmers, particularly in disadvantaged areas, Brexit becoming a reality will have a detrimental effect on so many.  Some say that many will be wiped out and that farming as we know it in disadvantaged rural areas will be lost forever.  Worry over Brexit has meant that the price of cattle has already fallen.  The price of cattle is very bad.<\/p><p>Business people are worried about changes in the value of sterling.  People with small industries who export to the North of Ireland and the United Kingdom are already losing money because of the cost of sterling.<\/p> <p> We are worried that the cross-border directive, which we use frequently to bring patients to the North to get cataracts removed from their eyes and thereby prevent them from losing their sight, will cease or will not work for us anymore when Brexit becomes a reality.  Many people would have gone blind by this stage if we had not been able to take them to the North on buses over the last 12 or 18 months.  The ability to avail of this directive has saved the eyesight of hundreds of people.  Many people are going to the North for hip operations and various other procedures.  They could not afford to do that, or attempt it at all, if they were not getting their money back under the cross-border directive.<\/p> <p> I wonder how the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste got it so wrong before Christmas last year when they said there was going to be no hard Brexit.  It is so serious.  Mrs. May does not appear to know what she is doing.  She is saying one thing one day and saying another thing another day.  We will lose many markets to England if Brexit becomes a reality.  We are all hoping for another referendum and a different result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500042#PP00500","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537902600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to share some of my reflections on what is happening during the Brexit negotiations, which are so critical for our country, our neighbours and our European Union.  Like most of my colleagues in this House, I have spent two years looking at this inside out and upside down.  We are no wiser about what will happen in the next six months than we were a year or two years ago.  Who would have thought we would be living in a world in which we would hear a speech like that given by the US President today?  I am in a state of flabbergast at some of the sentiments that were expressed in his speech.  Similarly, who would have thought that the UK political system would be in such a fractured state?  It is not just fractured.  I was thinking today that if we end up with a simple choice between the Tories going for some kind of Canada-plus deal and the UK Labour Party going for some kind of Norway-plus deal, we could see what side will win.  While that is the usual fracture in any political system, we need to look at the fracturing within both parties.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Prime Minister May today ruled out a Canadian-type trade deal arrangement on the basis that it would inevitably lead to the fracturing of their Union and the introduction of borders in the Irish Sea.  It is hard to understand why she is adopting that as her firmest and most trenchant position, given that on 5 December 2017 her Government was willing to sign off on an initial deal which would have provided for exactly that, as previous speakers have said.  One wonders whether some of the UK negotiating position is now informed by a desire to use the Irish issue as leverage to try to get some sort of favourable \"have cake and eat it\" terms whereby the UK benefits from some of the same flexibilities that the EU has rightly said it will extend to Ireland and - equally rightly - has said it will not extend to the UK.  That is only one path or possibility, but others can be followed.  I understand the UK Treasury intends to present a paper on Friday of this week which will outline how the costs of certain options favoured by Brexiteers could lead to a fall of 5% or 10% in the GDP of the UK, which would be the equivalent of the crash we have just been through.  We know what effect that would have on society and on the political system.  It is hard to imagine that any political system would inflict such a shock on its own country and economy.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, one gets a sense that the UK Labour Party is getting accustomed to the idea that the UK might stay within the Single Market or try to stay within the customs union.  When one drills down on that, one has to reflect on how those pursuing this option would answer the critics within the UK Labour Party and the Tory Party who would argue that it would involve the UK leaving the EU but becoming a rule-taker.  How would they get that through their own party?  If those within the UK Labour Party who are asking to be trusted on the basis that the key thing is to get into government do not have an answer to that question, we are left again in a state of uncertainty.<\/p>  <p>  I think we are in a difficult position.  I think Ireland and the EU have been taking the correct diplomatic approach, by and large.  This is a time to be united and strong, as the Union has been, and to maintain adherence to the treaties and to our code of law, which is what Michel Barnier is doing in protecting the four freedoms.  I know there are always circumstances in which those rules are seen to be moved, if the Union really has to move them.  I think the Union has taken the correct approach, by and large, in this instance and the Government and the D&aacute;il have followed suit.  I would like to make one criticism, however.  I think that in some of our tone and some of our diplomatic language and positioning, we are at risk of unnecessarily creating a division with our neighbours to the east and to the north which we may come to rue.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example of why I say that.  I was at an interesting conference during the week.  It dealt with our energy future and where we are going.  Anyone who knows anything about our low-carbon energy future knows that we have to move to a huge extent towards the electrification of our transport and heating systems.  The power grid is critical in that context.  This is at the heart of the new industrial revolution, not just for the energy sector but also for aspects of the digital sector like data centres and other infrastructure.  According to the best grid engineers at the conference in question, which was held in the middle of the week, we have to make sure we maintain an all-island approach.  They pointed out that we are going to have to run a synchronised system with huge quantities of renewable power on it and argued that it will be incredibly expensive to do this as part of a Twenty-six-County approach.  I know there are differing opinions on the issue of North-South interconnection.  I strongly adhere to the need for such a connection because my analysis of where we will need to go on energy, which is the critical industrial revolution of our times, and on the digital services that come with it, is that we need to adopt an all-island approach.  Regardless of the dealings that are eventually worked out, it would be a terrible failing for us to end up having to reintroduce the previous system on the island of Ireland.  It would not be a border in the sense that it would not involve checkpoints.  It would not be political in the sense that it would be on wires.  If we do not end up with an all-island energy market and co-operative all-island arrangements with regard to energy, it will be one of the tragedies of this whole process.  I am not just talking about the North because the scale of the energy transition we need, and the balancing capability we need, will also require an east-west connection with the UK and on into the rest of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  That is my vision of some of the critical things in this context.  They might be slightly policy-wonkish, but they actually matter.  That is why I was critical of the T&aacute;naiste when I heard him say on Saturday that he has not spoken to Arlene Foster in months.  Regardless of what we think of her actions with regard to the renewable heating incentive and the failure to re-establish the Northern Ireland Assembly, it is in our interests to maintain relations with her.  It is a concern that we are not talking to the DUP at this time, not just because there are practical issues to be discussed but also because regardless of what comes next, there will be a need to maintain personal relations in a way that reduces some of the concerns the DUP will have.  It seems inevitable in my mind that we will go towards some sort of border in the Irish Sea.  I know the Taoiseach said last week that we should not describe it as \"a border in the Irish Sea\", but the first premise I would come to is that we are not going to go along with borders between counties Monaghan and Tyrone, counties Cavan and Fermanagh or counties Donegal and Derry.<\/p><p>We are going to have to be careful in negotiations.  Maybe some people in the United Kingdom might decide to be really clever by forcing the European Union to impose such a border, or force an Irish Government to impose it.  We should hold to the Good Friday Agreement and say we have signed a globally recognised treaty and that we are not introducing a border come what may in this process, and that we may have to have border controls at some of our other ports but will not introduce a border along the Northern counties.  If that is to be the case, then it is critical we maintain good relations.<\/p> <p> I have a slight fear.  Part of this is to do with the UK press and others presenting us in a certain way.  I understand we are not in control of that.  I believe, however, that we have to be careful in our relations with the UK political system and the Northern Ireland political parties such that, whatever else happens, we will be able to pick up the pieces after the incredibly tense, uncertain next six months and return to a normal working arrangement.  I make this point as a former Minister responsible for energy who was able to sit down with Mrs. Arlene Foster and agree we would have the same energy target in the North and South, namely, 40% renewables.  We were able to agree that the ESB would purchase the distribution network.  We agreed to set up an all-island energy market and a common transmission system.  That was all possible because the decision was to a certain extent taken out of the identity politics account and was presented in a beneficial, good-relations account.  That is what we need to do.  It will not be easy to do in the next while but we should start talking to the DUP and listening.  The assembly should also be returned to do the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500043#QQ00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537903200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I will conclude by reiterating a couple of points and by trying to address the many points raised by many of the Deputies.  Time is running short.  We have all agreed on that and acknowledged it.  The efforts in the negotiations will, however, be redoubled and intensified in the coming weeks.  We need to see the successful completion of negotiations by the end of the period.  The October deadline has not changed.  The only way that there will be a November summit or an extraordinary meeting is if we have something to meet about.  Therefore, if we meet again in October with nothing new on the table, there will be no point to meeting.  Therefore, the October deadline is still in place for us and extremely important.  To use Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's analogy of ploughing and focusing one's sight on a tree, we have been very clear since the very beginning of this process on what we are trying to do and the outcome: as part of the overall withdrawal agreement, we must include the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  We have not moved on this.  Our EU partners, in supporting us as part of the European Union, have not moved on this.<\/p>  <p>  I will address again the issue of having separate or secret negotiations.  We believe it would be a strategic mistake to change in this regard.  We are not having separate negotiations with the United Kingdom.  That is the reason the European Union fully supports us and why we have had its support until now.  Our priority for now is to conclude the withdrawal agreement.  Again, this includes the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which, of course, encompasses the backstop.  It is imperative, however, that the United Kingdom in these final stages of negotiations engage with the issues that have been identified to achieve the progress by the October Council meeting.  It has given these guarantees time and again, not just at Christmas but also in March, in the Chequers paper and at the meeting last week.  The United Kingdom has provided these guarantees to avoid a hard border.  It has given clear commitments on agreeing a backstop and has indicated it will bring forward its own proposals shortly.  Of course, time is of the essence.<\/p>  <p>  Michel Barnier's approach &mdash; to de-dramatise the protocol and focus on what is currently in place, what is moving north and south, what goods are moving and where they are coming from, including from east to west, and whether goods go through Ireland before getting to Northern Ireland &mdash; is an attempt to find a way forward because to date, the United Kingdom has not agreed with our proposed legal wording on the backstop.  It has not agreed with Michel Barnier's approach.  Therefore, it must bring forward its solutions.  What we saw last week in Salzburg was not a hardening of Irish or EU positions but merely a restating of the position we have always had, that we must have a legally binding and operable backstop in place in the withdrawal agreement for us to move forward.  The European Union clearly stated its position that we cannot interrupt or change the integrity of the Single Market or cherry-pick the four freedoms.  Were there any view that Ireland had hardened its position against the United Kingdom, I would absolutely disagree because, for us, the United Kingdom will remain a key partner.  We want the best possible outcome.  We want the United Kingdom and the European Union, including Ireland, to have the best possible relationship moving forward.  Our bilateral relationship with the United Kingdom is important.  Brexit inevitably puts pressure on it but our Ministers, despite all this, meet regularly and try to discuss a number of areas of mutual interest.  We have reached agreement on the common travel area.  It will remain in place irrespective of the outcome.  The British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference met in July.  There are already discussions to determine how the Good Friday Agreement could be used in terms of bilateral relationships after the United Kingdom leaves the Union.  This is a relationship that is very important to us.  I do not believe anybody here would disagree with that.<\/p>  <p>  Specific issues have been raised.  Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned the single energy market.  As part of the European Union, we are working with the United Kingdom to try to ensure these issues are addressed.  The issues include the landbridge through the United Kingdom, which is obviously extremely important in terms of the transit of goods between Ireland and the Continent.<\/p>  <p>  Our contingency and preparedness planning has intensified and is well advanced.  It will be more visible from now on.  Deputy Lisa Chambers raised the issue of freedom of information.  Negotiations are at a very difficult stage.  Our contingency planning is continuing but we must not endanger it or have it interrupted.  I take the Deputy's point on transparency.  We encourage individuals and all sectors and industries to get involved in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready campaign, which will build public awareness and outline the measures that are already in place.  We have already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures, focusing on east&ndash;west trade, including the preparation of our ports and airports to take into account the changes.  Deputy Troy asked when this will happen.  This was agreed by the Cabinet only last week but these measures have been put in place and we will be hiring staff as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  A number of issues were raised by Deputies across the Chamber.  For the past two years, all our Departments and individual Ministers have been asked to identify the various challenges they or industries or representative groups may face.  They have been asked to identify possible measures, including legislation, regulation and new funding, that need to be put in place.  Since the summer, they have been asked to put in place an action plan.  All the issues raised today have been identified not only by the Departments but also by the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  We do not know the full nature and extent of the change Brexit will bring.  Obviously, this depends on the outcome of the negotiations.  I assure Members that the Government will be ready to meet that challenge.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Burton's question on our plan for Ireland and the border, our plan is the Irish backstop.  Negotiations have still not finished.  The withdrawal agreement is 90% complete.  The United Kingdom has said it will bring forward proposals.  Therefore, we need to see those proposals.  Ireland, as a member of the European Union, is ready to work with them, and we believe there is still time.  I thank the Deputies again for their support in all this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500044#RR00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Markets in Financial Instruments Bill 2018: Order for Report Stage","time":1537903200,"counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500044#RR00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1537903200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500044#RR00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537903200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Markets in Financial Instruments Bill 2018: Report and Final Stages","time":1537903200,"counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092500044#RR00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1537903200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The amendments have been ruled out of order.
