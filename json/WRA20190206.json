With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to higher value added product development.<\/p>  <p>  These projections relate primarily to increasing the added-value of agrifood exports. <\/p>  <p>   Market development &ndash; developing new markets and growing existing markets, based on market insights &ndash; is one of the five themes of Food Wise, along with environmental sustainability, competitiveness, innovation and human capital. Obviously market development and diversification is also a key response to the challenges which Brexit poses for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2017 I launched a seven point action plan on market access. This is being implemented through a variety of actions, including:<\/p>  <p>  - a market prioritisation exercise and subsequent detailed studies carried out by Bord Bia on behalf of my Department. On meat the five countries selected for detailed study were: Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico &amp;amp; Malaysia; and for dairy: Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia &amp;amp; Vietnam.<\/p>  <p>  - A market access web portal launched in May 2018, and available on my Department&rsquo;s website provides a wide range of valuable information to exporters.<\/p>  <p>  Trying to gain new market access, or enhance and improve existing market access has been a particularly prominent feature of recent Ministerial Trade Missions led by myself and my colleague Andrew Doyle.

In Estimates 2019, I provided a further allocation of &euro;5.3 million to Bord Bia, bringing its total grant in aid to &euro;46.6 million for 2019.  This compares to a grant of &euro;28.9 million in 2014, and represents a 60% increase in funding for marketing and promotion of our food offering over five years.  Bord Bia also received approval last year to recruit an additional 32 staff, which will bring total staff numbers to 146 in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, I secured &euro;20 million for a new Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production.

This work has in turn contributed to the development of the Agricultural Sustainability Support &amp;amp; Advisory Programme, a collaborative initiative to facilitate improvements in water quality. <\/p>  <p>  While we are making progress, there is no room for complacency &ndash; the agri-food sector must continue to make improvements in terms of sustainability and environmental performance. Collaboration, co-operation and collective responsibility are necessary to meet the challenges that are facing us. I am convinced that we must all work together to ensure that the sector continues to play its part in meeting our climate obligations and challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600070#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600070#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[5486\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600070#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is engaging in Europe-wide discussions on the export and welfare of greyhounds, in particular to countries with little or no welfare standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The vast majority of dogs that are moved from Ireland go to the UK.

The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. These proposals are complex and we are now in the middle of intensive and challenging negotiations for the next CAP 2021-27.<\/p>  <p>  Consideration of the CAP proposals is ongoing at EU level.  Since the legislative proposals were launched in June 2018 a total of 25 Working Group meetings have taken place under the Austrian Presidency.  The proposals are also discussed at the Special Committee of Agriculture meetings on a regular basis.  In addition, CAP post 2020 is also a standing agenda item at every Agri-Fish Council meeting where I have discussed the CAP proposals extensively with my Agriculture Ministerial colleagues.  <\/p>  <p>  The Romanian Presidency has outlined an equally intensive programme of Working Group meetings to discuss specific aspects of the CAP proposals for the duration of their Presidency.  I had a further opportunity to discuss the proposals at the recent Agri-Fish Council which took place on Monday 28 January.<\/p>  <p>  The EU proposed CAP budgetary ceilings form part of the wider proposals on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027.  These proposals are ultimately a matter for agreement between Ministers for Finance and Heads of State.  <\/p>  <p>  The MFF post 2020 proposals, outline a funding envelope of &euro;365 billion for the Common Agricultural Policy. This represents an approximate cut of 5%, when compared to the current period.  This is unacceptable for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>   The MFF proposals also provide for spending in areas such as research, migration and defence, which are priorities for some Member States.  The loss of UK contributions to the EU budget  add a further complication to these already challenging negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  Throughout these negotiations, achieving Ireland&rsquo;s priorities will be a key issue for the Government. Ireland has stated clearly that it is important that traditional policies with demonstrated added value continue to be properly supported. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is such a policy and a strong budget for the CAP post 2020 remains a key priority for Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  From an agriculture perspective, I have been working closely with EU colleagues to build a consensus around the need to protect the CAP budget in the next MFF. Given that MFF  matters are decided by unanimity, it is essential to build alliances around critical goals. <\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, I have had a series of bilateral meetings with EU counterparts, to build support for a strong CAP budget post 2020. Furthermore,  In May 2018, I   agreed a Memorandum, with five European colleagues, seeking to maintain CAP funding for the 2021 - 27 period at current EU 27 levels. I, along with my Ministerial colleagues from France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland, have signed the Memorandum.  Support has grown for this position and up to 20 Member States have now expressed their support for this proposal.<\/p>  <p>  Over the coming months there will be detailed negotiations at all levels across the EU as member states work together to shape the final outcome of both the CAP and the MFF proposals. I can assure the deputy that the need to ensure that the CAP is properly funded, and continues to support farm families and the rural economy, will remain at the very centre of our considerations. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work to develop a broad consensus on the need for a  strong and fit-for-purpose agriculture sector at the heart of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600071#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse Racing Ireland","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600071#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[52111\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600071#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he had discussions with an organisation (details supplied) prior to its decision in 2016 to sell broadcast rights to a company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) is a commercial State Body responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the horse racing industry.<\/p><p>The question the Deputy has raised is solely an operational matter for HRI ,and I had no involvement in the matter. <\/p><p>HRI have informed me that new media rights arrangements represent a positive move for Irish racing and provide guarantees regarding income for racecourses up to 2023 during a time of great uncertainty, not least in the context of Brexit.

The value of exports to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America stood at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017.  The value of trade to these markets increased by 159% since 2009.  These markets now account for over 20% of total agri-food exports. <\/p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which just under &euro;1 billion went to China. Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017.

The FAO has also recognised the efficiency of our temperate grassland based production systems. Evidence of this is further reflected in the EU Joint Research Centre Report (2010) which illustrated that while intensive dairy systems create less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than extensive ones, this is countered by higher emissions from land use and land use change.

The Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland is an integral part of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU, and addresses the fundamental rights and citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission Task Force conducted the negotiations with the UK on the Withdrawal Agreement. Throughout this process, I engaged actively with each of my British Government counterparts to underline the Government&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland and the imperative of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the achievements of the Peace Process, and I continue to do so. Over the course of the last several months, I have met with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab during his time as UK Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley and David Lidington, the UK Minister of the Cabinet Office, with whom I remain in regular contact.<\/p>  <p>  I also speak regularly with the leaders of each of the political parties in Northern Ireland on the European Union&rsquo;s endeavours to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement throughout the Article 50 negotiations and ratification process. I held discussions most recently on this with each of the party leaders, including Arlene Foster, in Belfast on 10 January where I reiterated its vital importance.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the negotiations between the UK and the EU Task Force, I and my officials were in frequent communication with Michel Barnier and his team, as well as with the other EU27 Member States. In my contacts with EU partners, Member States and institutions, they showed, and continue to show unwavering solidarity on the backstop, for which I am extremely grateful. <\/p>  <p>  A no deal Brexit is the worst possible outcome and would not be in the interests of the UK, Ireland or the EU.  That is why the Government&rsquo;s focus remains on securing the deal that has been reached. The Government remains firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government. <\/p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the gains of the Peace Process. Importantly, nothing in the Agreement will prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It also protects the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity and confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens. It provides for a period of transition, which can be extended, in which preparations can be made for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. The European Council has made clear that it stands by the Withdrawal Agreement and that it is not for renegotiation.<\/p>  <p>  Under any scenario for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union, the obligations and commitments of the Irish and British Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain and the Government will continue to work with the British Government as co-guarantor to secure the full implementation of the Agreement and the effective operation of all of its institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600072#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600072#WRD02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600072#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[5881\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600072#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of businesses that qualify for the deferred payments scheme; the length of time it takes to process an application for the scheme; if the Revenue Commissioners will be obliged to allow the scheme apply to all traders following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU; if the Revenue Commissioners have increased the number of employees in the deferred scheme section to deal the increased demand on this section; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>There are currently 768 individual traders authorised for the deferred payment scheme.

These new arrangements do not affect the way income tax and other statutory deductions are calculated under the PAYE system, but do change the way employers report payroll information to Revenue. In most cases the new real-time reporting arrangements have seamlessly integrated into employer&rsquo;s payroll systems without any impact on employees.  <\/p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s general information, the PAYE system does not treat people on temporary contracts any differently to those on full time or permanent contracts. As such, employers are obliged to notify Revenue where an employee has started or has ceased working for them, regardless of the employment status involved. This ensures that employees gain the full benefit of their tax credit and rate band entitlements each time they are paid. For example, where Revenue is notified of the cessation of an employment, the person&rsquo;s tax credit and rate band entitlements are automatically transferred to any other active employment that s\/he may have. <\/p>  <p>  The application of the &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis of deduction only occurs in limited circumstances, for example where there is a lack of information about previous employments or where application of the cumulative basis would create significant hardship for the employee. Under PAYE Modernisation, employers are required to report the pay and tax details of their employees every time they run a payroll, which means the individual records should always be up to date. Consequently, it is expected that people in irregular employment should pay the proper amount of tax at each pay date and that the application of the &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis of deduction should only occur in limited circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600072#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600072#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[5846\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600072#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if, in the event of new evidence in the case of persons (details supplied), a further review of their case can be undertaken by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman with a view to addressing the most recently emerged issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>Firstly, I must point out that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) is independent in the performance of his statutory functions.

A revised Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour (the Code) was published by the Standards in Public Office Commission in September 2008.  This Code, which applies to all civil servants, is an important element of the overall framework within which civil servants are expected to work.  It sets out the standards required of civil servants in the discharge of their duties.  <\/p>  <p>  The Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 (the Bill) is a key consideration in terms of updating this current Code.  This Bill provides for a Public Sector Standards Commissioner to replace the current Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPOC). Section 30 of the Bill provides that the Commissioner shall draw up and issue a model code of conduct for the guidance of public officials  with regard to compliance with the provisions of the Bill. This model code must have regard to the general principles on standards of integrity contained in section 10 of the Bill.  Furthermore, the Commissioner must promote, through training, education and research, and guidelines issued for the purpose by the Commissioner, the highest standards of conduct and integrity among public officials, and, in particular, regarding the prevention of situations in which conflicts of interest could arise in relation to their duties. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, public bodies may adopt their own codes to meet particular requirements while having regard to the principles and standards in the model code.  Sectorial codes will be drawn up by particular bodies (e.g. for the Civil Service by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform).   The Commissioner may advise as to whether amendments to any such code are required.  <\/p>  <p>  So once enacted, this Bill will allow my Department to review the current Code in the context of the Commissioners model code and revise it as required.   Further information on the current position regarding the Bill is at APPENDIX 1. <\/p>  <p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour is a document that reflects the standards required of civil servants in the performance of their official duties. There are also various circulars relating to the terms and conditions of employment of civil servants.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the ethics obligations of civil servants, including the provision of ethics returns, is dealt with under the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 (the Ethics Acts).<\/p>  <p>  It would seem unlikely that there would be conflicts between membership professional codes of ethics and the current Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour .  However, should issues arise, there is provision in the Code (para. 3.2) for staff to obtain clarification on any aspect of the Code.  In addition, under section 10(12) of the Act the SIPOC can give advice on the Code in particular circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  APPENDIX 1 <\/p>  <p>  The Public Sector  Standards Bill is currently making its way through the legislative process in the D&aacute;il.

Influenza vaccine is most effective when circulating viruses are well-matched with viruses contained in vaccines due to their constant evolving nature.  These recommendations are used by national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines. <\/p><p>The influenza vaccine purchased by HSE is based on WHO advice on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere influenza season.  The WHO issued its advice on 22 February 2018, recommending that quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2018\/19 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:<\/p><p>- an A\/Michigan\/45\/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;<\/p><p>- an A\/Singapore\/INFIMH-16-0019\/2016 (H3N2)-like virus;<\/p><p>- a B\/Colorado\/06\/2017-like virus (B\/Victoria\/2\/87 lineage); and<\/p><p>- a B\/Phuket\/3073\/2013-like virus (B\/Yamagata\/16\/88 lineage).<\/p><p>It also recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2018\/19 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B\/Colorado\/06\/2017-like virus of the B\/Victoria\/2\/87-lineage.  The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe and is providing good protection against the influenza A strain viruses that are circulating this season as the majority of hospitalisations are associated with influenza A. <\/p><p>The WHO will shortly be holding a consultation and information meeting in Beijing, China on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2019\/20 northern hemisphere influenza season between the 18 to 20 February.  After this meeting the WHO will announce its recommendation for the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2019\/20 northern hemisphere<b><\/b>influenza season<b><\/b>for both quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines.  The Flu vaccine purchased by HSE will be based on this advice. <\/p><p>The HSE National Immunisation Office and HSE Procurement are responsible for the purchase of influenza vaccine.  To ensure adequate vaccine supply, this tender process must be completed 9 months in advance of the first delivery into Ireland by the end of August as it takes about 6 months to manufacture sufficient vaccine quantity for each season. It is intended that a quadrivalent vaccine will be used for 2019\/20 and a procurement process through the HSE is currently underway.  The composition of the vaccine will be based on the advices of the WHO for the 2019\/20 northern hemisphere<b><\/b>influenza season which is due to be announced in a few weeks&rsquo; time.<\/p><p>The seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for the following at risk groups:<\/p><p>- persons who are 65 years of age and over;<\/p><p>- pregnant women;<\/p><p>- persons who have a long-term health condition;<\/p><p>- persons who work in healthcare;<\/p><p>- carers;<\/p><p>- persons living in a nursing home or other long-term care facility; and<\/p><p>- persons who are in regular contact with pigs, poultry or water fowl. <\/p><p>As of 27 January 2019 (week 4) there were 1,066 confirmed influenza related hospitalised cases compared to 1,825 for the same time period last year.  The number of confirmed deaths for week 4, 2019 is 25 compared to 112 for the same time period last year. <\/p><p>The 2017\/18 influenza season was a severe season with a high impact placed on the Irish health system.  During the 2017\/18 influenza season, 255 influenza related cases were reported as having died, the highest number of influenza deaths recorded in any season.  The total number of confirmed influenza cases hospitalised during the 2017\/18 influenza season was 4,713 which<b><\/b>exceeded all previous seasons on record since surveillance began in 2000.<\/p><p>Vaccination still remains the most effective means of preventing infection caused by seasonal influenza viruses and can reduce severe disease that can lead to hospitalisation and even death.<\/p><p>The HSE reviews and updates its influenza plans annually, including its communication strategy, taking into account the lessons learned from previous years, with a view to targeting key groups in order to create the greatest impact in terms of people receiving the influenza vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600075#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Capital Programme","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600075#WRG01600"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[5910\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600075#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there will be a delay in the provision of capital funding to Cavan General Hospital for the purpose of upgrading wards in view of the significant cost overruns in the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is currently developing its Capital Plan for 2019.

The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas. Key features of this policy include setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible, and in all cases by 2020 as well as a discards ban (Landing Obligation) to be phased in over the period 2015 to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is an essential aspect of the policy. Fishing opportunities are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. The Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2018, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. From the 74 stocks, 32 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2018. This number has grown every year since 2013. This in turn leads to the number of stocks being over fished declining from 22 in 2014 to 16 in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 December Fisheries Council, at which quotas for 2019 were agreed showed a rebuilding of many stocks. I was pleased that the scientific advice supported large increases in a number of stocks of importance such as Haddock (+20%), Hake (+28%) and Megrims (+47%) in the Celtic Sea. The overall increase of 30% in whitefish quota will provide improved fishing opportunities for whitefish fishermen all around our coasts. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time that the sustainability of our fish stocks is improving year on year, we are facing considerable uncertainty for our fishing industry arising from Brexit.  Like all sectors a &lsquo;no deal outcome would be the worst possible result for fisheries but I remain optimistic, while preparing for all eventualities, that such an outcome can be averted.<\/p>  <p>  Provided we can successfully navigate the potential difficulties arising from Brexit, in cooperation with our EU27 partners, I am confident that we will be able to ensure the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors, thereby supporting the families and communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600076#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agricultural Production Costs","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600076#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[5924\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600076#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which the costs of farm inputs such as fertilisers are monitored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":433,"content":"<p>My Department continually monitors the cost of farm production inputs using data available from national and international sources.

The last such report was published in 2016, includes a specific focus on climate change, and is available from the EPA&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also supported in the delivery of its policy objectives for the decarbonisation of the energy sector by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). In addition to the delivery of a range of programmes and schemes on behalf of the Department, the functions of SEAI include the preparation of national energy statistics and projections. SEAI also undertakes national energy modelling functions, informed inter alia by data collected from the various schemes and programmes that it administers. <\/p>  <p>  SEAI had a total of 91 staff as at the end of December 2018. EPA had a total of 410 staff at that time. While it is difficult to fully disaggregate the number of EPA staff working on climate issues, the EPA estimate this at 32.<\/p>  <p>  The work of both EPA and SEAI inform, in turn, the wider work of the Technical Research and Modelling (TRAM) Group, which provides the overall framework for the provision of technical capacity to Government Departments for climate action policy development and implementation. <\/p>  <p>  TRAM was established on foot of a Government Decision in 2015 and its membership comprises technical experts from relevant Government Departments and Agencies. In addition, representatives of externally contracted bodies providing modelling and analytical support may participate in TRAM meetings. To date, these services have been provided by ESRI, UCC, UCD and EnvEcon. TRAM is chaired at Assistant Secretary level in my Department and reports to the Climate Action High Level Steering Group, which is chaired at ministerial level. <\/p>  <p>  TRAM performs a number of functions in support of climate, air and energy policy development processes for this Department and for a number of other Government Departments and Agencies:<\/p>  <p>  -  implementation of a rolling work programme of technical analysis and research required, inter alia, in order to further the process of identifying the most cost effective transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy in the context of climate, air and energy policy;<\/p>  <p>  -  provision of a clearing house for the development of climate, air and energy policy in other related technical areas such as the EU ETS, air quality, and the application of fiscal instruments; <\/p>  <p>  -  acting as a focal point for technical information flow between relevant Government Departments and Agencies on issues of a technical and economic nature; and <\/p>  <p>  -  providing a resource for the engagement of the necessary external expertise to undertake the modelling, analysis and research required. <\/p>  <p>  The climate-related work of the Department is also supported by the climate information platform, Climate Ireland, which comprises a website www.climateireland.ie and other resources to assist with climate adaptation planning in Ireland. Climate Ireland was originally developed under the EPA research programme on Climate Change and the EPA currently manages the operational platform with expert support from six staff members in the Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy (MaREI), based in UCC. The platform provides decision makers with a one stop repository of climate specific information, data and knowledge to support planning for the impacts and consequences of climate change and supports the Department through their work with the key sectors in preparing sectorial adaptation plans as required under the National Adaptation Framework. The Climate Ireland team also play a pivotal role in helping to build capacity and knowledge of climate related matters across all the sectors including Local Government and it is fully intended that Climate Ireland will continue to function as a long-term operational support for climate action in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600076#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Litter Pollution","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600076#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[5818\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600076#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to allocate additional funding to Limerick City and County Council to tackle litter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>Littering is first and foremost a matter of individual responsibility and compliance with the law.

The measures announced as part of Budget 2018 formed part of a trend in continued growth in early years investment.<\/p><p>The increase in supports I announced in April 2017 represented a major step towards accessible, affordable and quality ELC and SAC after decades of neglect and under-investment by successive Governments. These increases reflect my ambition to support quality ELC and SAC services with appropriately supported staff. <\/p><p>These increases were considerable, up to 50% in the targeted subsidies, which significantly decreases the amount of payment required of low income families or parents in education or training.<\/p><p>As part of the Government policy to make ELC and SAC more affordable,  I introduced a universal childcare subvention payment, in September 2017, of up to &euro;20 per week (up to &euro;1,040 per annum) for families using eligible ELC providers for the care of children aged from 6 months to the first eligible point of entry of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. <\/p><p>These changes are waypoints towards our goal to deliver genuine affordable, accessible, quality ELC and SAC. My Department is also progressing with the wider Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) Project.  <\/p><p>The ACS is a radical new approach to how we deliver accessible, affordable, high quality ELC and SAC to families in Ireland. The scheme will open to applications in October 2019, with payments flowing from November 2019.  Its launch will mark a milestone in our quest to transform Ireland's ELC and SAC system from one of the most expensive in the world into one of the best.<\/p><p>When introduced, it will represent a major landmark for all children and families in Ireland, and especially for lower income families and lone parents. It may be accessed by all families and not just those working or studying full time. International reports have stated that ACS will significantly address affordability for lower income families and, for example, Ireland will change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for ELC and SAC for lone parents, to 11th position. <\/p><p>In the last 4 years, the DCYA has increased funding for ELC and SAC by 117%. This has doubled the number of children accessing subsidies.<\/p><p>Under the ACS, all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;60,000 will be able to claim income-based subsidies, an increase of 26% to the original threshold.  The scheme&rsquo;s lower income thresholds have also been adjusted, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (the previous proposed threshold stood at &euro;22,700).  The increase in the lower threshold is important in terms of benefitting the people at the lower end of the income spectrum, by &lsquo;poverty proofing&rsquo; the scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme. For those above the net income threshold of &euro;60,000, but with a child under 3 in regulated childcare, the scheme will continue to make up to &euro;1,040 per annum available.  These increased thresholds will mean that thousands more families will benefit from the new Affordable Childcare Scheme once launched at the end of 2019 and will see their childcare costs tangibly reduce.<\/p><p>The recently launched Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, First 5, identifies an action to develop and introduce a new funding model for early learning and care to support improved quality of provision, whilst also improving affordability for parents. <\/p><p>As part of the development of a new funding model for Early Learning and Care, mechanisms to control fees charged to parents will be explored.<\/p><p>This new approach will complement the Affordable Childcare Scheme, launching in October 2019, to subsidise the cost of provision for parents and the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) which provides for a fully funded provision for 15 hours per week for children in the two years before they begin primary school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600077#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":518,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600077#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":519,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[5895\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019020600077#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will address a matter (details supplied) regarding an additional pre-school year for a child.","asker":"1235","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":520,"content":"<p>It should be noted that the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) is a two year pre-school programme. There is no routine provision for a third year which may not be in the best interests of a child and may lead to breaching the statutory school starting age.<\/p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible so, therefore, an allowance was made. Their ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that this provision of an overage exemption by my Department for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place. In the past, the operation of the system of overage exemption has caused confusion where some parents and providers have incorrectly believed that an overage exemption approval from the DCYA represented a derogation from age requirements attaching to the statutory requirement that a child attend primary school before the age of 6 years.<\/p>  <p>  The overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and a report was produced by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from my Department are now considering policy options following on from this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child. There are no funding or other considerations whatsoever. I would also note that research shows broad agreement that it is in the best interest of the child to start school with their peers.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the specific case you have raised, I would stress that each application for an exemption is considered on its own merits and never in the context of the outcome of any other case.<\/p>  <p>  In this instance, the application was declined on the basis that the full two year ECCE entitlement had already been availed of and with regard to the fact that the child named would be over age 6 years starting school. A key finding of the NDA report, which will be published in the near future, is that generally it is in children's best interest to enrol in primary school with their peers and to transition to becoming a teenager with their peers.<\/p>  <p>  The report also seeks to ensure that schools offer all the assistance necessary to meet the child's needs, with the assistance of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). We will be happy to assist the family, if requested, to make contact with the NCSE to ensure that adequate preparations are in place for the child to start school in September 2019.

Where the administrator of a pension scheme or a life company is unable to trace a member using their own resources they can use my Department&rsquo;s host mailing service.  Following discussions between my Department, the Pensions Authority and the Irish Association of Pension Funds, a revised protocol was put in place in October 2013.  The protocol sets out the Department&rsquo;s requirements for organisations using the host mailing service.  The pension provider must have made an unsuccessful attempt to contact the scheme member.  The Department will forward letters to the last known address of the member based on its records if this address differs from that which the pension provider has.<\/p>  <p>  From 2013 (relating to the 2012 tax year), P35 returns from employers are collecting the Pensions Authority reference number of any scheme operated by the employer to which the employees contribute.

In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and the tenant.  The Department has no contractual relationship with the landlord and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and\/or recourse to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and\/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 tenants are obliged not to behave within a dwelling, or in the vicinity of it, in a way that is anti-social.  Landlords are obliged to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations, and may seek termination of a tenancy due to a tenant&rsquo;s antisocial behaviour.  <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides the Department with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.   <\/p>  <p>  The strategic goal of returning rent supplement to its original purpose; that of a short-term income support, has been primarily facilitated by the introduction of the HAP.

The draft regulations and accompanying technical guidance to implement this have completed public consultation and the regulations are expected to be signed into law shortly. These regulations will also require that where Major Renovations take place which are greater than 25% of the surface area of the dwelling, the dwelling should achieve a cost optimal performance where feasible.
