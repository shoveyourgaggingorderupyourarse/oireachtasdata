His remarks were effectively endorsed by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s party colleague, Mairead McGuinness, MEP, this morning in a radio interview.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody wants a hard Brexit.  We all cannot reiterate that enough.  However, the indecision of the Westminster Parliament may land us in one, either by accident or by design on the part of some MPs.  However, the one shred of light is that the customs union proposition may be the most politically palatable given that the division on it last evening was lost by only three votes.  The British Cabinet is currently meeting.  As we know by now, we cannot anticipate what it will decide.  Many businesses, farmers and fishermen, as well as communities on the Border and across the island, are petrified as to what will happen on Friday, 12 April.  Last Friday was supposed to be Brexit day but the date was kicked to 12 April, which is only a week away.  If what those eminent people stated this morning comes to pass, we may end up, by accident, in a situation nobody wants.<\/p>  <p>  There is an onus on the Government to ensure that we are adequately prepared and to begin communicating what are the plans.  We all received a Government leaflet this morning which indicates that without the EU-UK withdrawal agreement \"avoiding a hard border will be more challenging and will require detailed discussions\".  It also states \"In that scenario the outcome, including practical arrangements for citizens and businesses ... will be made public as soon as possible.\"<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will meet President Macron today and the Chancellor Merkel on Thursday.  Several weeks ago, the Chancellor Merkel asked if Ireland was prepared for what could be a hard Brexit and stated that in the absence of a deal there would be no Irish backstop.  She asked the Taoiseach to outline how the Single Market would be protected between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  She urged officials to get a move on.  The Taoiseach has confirmed in the House that contacts are taking place between Ireland and the European Commission about protecting the Single Market but that he would not share papers or documents.  Is that still the case?  What is on the agenda for the meeting between the Taoiseach President Macron.  Is it about protecting the Single Market and planning for the event of a no-deal Brexit?  Where will today&rsquo;s and Thursday&rsquo;s discussions lead this island?  What is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s view on the likely outcome over the coming days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200003#A00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1554210000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for asking his question and for giving me an opportunity to update the House on this matter.  I agree with Michel Barnier and others when they say that, as the days pass, a no-deal Brexit looks like a real possibility.<\/p><p>Of course, we hope that will not be the case but the country needs to be ready if it is.  The Government is very much focused on working with all other parties in this House to ensure we do everything we can to prepare Ireland for that outcome, which would put huge strain and pressure on many sectors across the country.  We are well prepared in many ways and we go through the detail of that preparation on a regular basis with stakeholders and many others.  State agencies are constantly reaching out and speaking to different sectors and businesses on what they need to do to prepare for Brexit.  I will bring two Brexit papers to Cabinet this evening when it meets at 8.30 p.m. on the Taoiseach's return from Paris.  I assure the Deputy that the no-deal Brexit preparations have intensified significantly in recent days and that will continue.<\/p> <p> On the difficult issue of how we respond to the challenges of an all-island economy in the context of the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union and, therefore, Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, being outside of the customs union and Single Market without any deal in place, we have always said that is a very difficult challenge to respond to for us, as a Government, and the EU collectively.  We have a dual responsibility to protect the integrity of the EU Single Market, of which we are very much a part, and Ireland will not to allow a situation where the UK leaving the European Union without a deal drags Ireland out of the Single Market with it.  We cannot allow that situation.  By that I mean that a response that involves checks in EU ports on all Irish products is not a runner.  That would cause significant damage to our economy and we will not allow it.  What we need to do, and what we are doing now, is to intensify our discussions with the European Commission on how we respond to the dual responsibility of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and relations on this island as best we can while, at the same time, ensuring that we can reassure other EU countries that Ireland is protecting the integrity of the Single Market that we all share.  The Taoiseach has referred to the conversations that have begun on that issue.  There was a meeting last Friday and those discussions will continue into this week.  We must find a way to protect the Single Market's integrity but also avoid physical infrastructure on the Border.  That is something on which we do not have an agreed plan we are working this week, and into next week if necessary, in the context of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200003#A00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554210300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Every part of this House wants to work with the Government in preparation for a hard Brexit but we need information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200004#B00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1554210300,"counter":10,"content":"<p>What is the plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200004#B00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1554210300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We need to see the details of the plan so that we can share it and get it out there.

The debacle surrounding the cost of the national children's hospital rumbles on, nurses and midwives have had to engage in industrial action, one-in-seven consultant posts is vacant and support staff have announced their intention to ballot for industrial action.  All the while, hospital waiting lists continue to grow and hundreds of patients are left on hospital trolleys, day in, day out.<\/p><p>Last night, in Cork University Hospital, there was a status black escalation declared, with patients attending the emergency department facing extreme delays of up to 12 hours and with services reaching breaking point.  A status black escalation is declared, I understand, when the hospital is at maximum capacity and when it is deemed unsafe to admit further patients.<\/p><p>There is a capacity crisis in the health service and this is very concerning.  There were 70 people on trolleys in Cork University Hospital this morning, with 570 people on trolleys across the State.  Yesterday, in Limerick, there were more people on trolleys than in Dublin's nine hospitals combined, according to the INMO.

This is an increase on the same day last year when there were 296 patients on trolleys.  The number of patients waiting on trolleys at Cork University Hospital this morning is exceptionally high.  The HSE has confirmed that South\/South West hospital group personnel were on-site and community teams were actively seeking additional community beds to support discharges.  In addition, the national director of acute hospitals in the HSE will visit CUH today.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE identified specific issues and challenges on the site.  The first was a significant capacity demand mismatch, with high rates of attendance and admission and a low rate of discharges.  The hospital remains in full capacity protocol, with the highest trolley count this year on the site.  Key actions are now under way in Cork University Hospital to improve the position for patients and these include full mobilisation of all resources, escalation meetings with both the group chief executive officer and chief compliance officer and meetings scheduled with consultants.  There is to be a review of diagnostics and cancellation of diagnostics tomorrow and Thursday.  Community health organisation representatives are on the site to review patients for transfer to step-down facilities and there will be identification of patients to expedite transfers to local rehabilitation units.

It is a shambles of epic proportions and it is difficult to comprehend the magnitude of the disastrous management of Brexit by the UK Government and Parliament.  That incompetence underlines how crucial it is to have stability of Government here and to have our Oireachtas united in defence of the national interest.  It is fair and appropriate to acknowledge the solid contribution of the T&aacute;naiste during a time of pending crisis by striking a correct balance throughout a complex process.<\/p>  <p>  As a former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the T&aacute;naiste is aware that the UK and Ireland are each other's largest export market for food and drink.  Therefore, it is the sector that is most exposed to any negative economic impact of the UK Brexit decision.  Borders and tariffs between the UK and Ireland would have a disastrous effect on our agricultural industry.  Therefore, access to the UK market is crucially important in all negotiations.  If access is curtailed, a substantial trade agreement must be the main objective in negotiations whereby free trade for agricultural products and food between the UK and Ireland is established.  <\/p>  <p>  Proper contingency plans are needed as beef farmers are threatened with income reductions of up to 40%.  The UK is a high-value market for beef with prices usually above the EU average.  We are also aware that the UK leaving the EU potentially reduces the CAP budget by up to &euro;3 billion annually.  Teagasc estimates that farm incomes could fall by 26% putting the livelihoods of some 100,000 farmers involved in livestock and beef production in danger and resulting in thousands of job losses.  This level of fallout will have catastrophic consequences throughout rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  What plans are in place regarding a contingency trade agreement that will alleviate concerns regarding our access to the UK market and guarantee a free flow of agricultural products moving from here to the UK with the highest standards of quality being maintained?<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste about substantial structural and adjustment funding aids, which will be necessary for our farmers to ensure there is a smooth transition period and that trade either continues or resumes.

In a no-deal scenario, there will be a very significant support package for farmers in the Republic.  We are working with the European Commission to ensure the Commission plays its role in that as well.<\/p><p>We are fortunate to have a Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development who understands the Irish agriculture industry very well.  However, in the context of a no-deal Brexit and the imposition of tariffs not only between Britain and Ireland, but also, potentially, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, with goods coming south, the all-island economy as it functions today, from an agrifood and agricultural perspective, would be significantly disrupted.  Therefore, our focus now is on working with the European Commission on how we would respond to that to keep people in business and protect farm incomes.<\/p> <p> The beef industry is particularly impacted in this regard.  Of the 130,000 farm families in Ireland, 100,000 get some income from beef, and 70,000 get all their farm income from beef.  Of all our beef exports, 53%, which is about 85% of all the beef produced, is exported to the UK, which is the highest-paying market in the world.  If one imposes significant tariffs on what is a tight-margin business, one does a lot of damage.  We are aware of this, which is why this is not an inexpensive problem to which to respond.<\/p> <p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and they have been preparing a contingency no-deal plan.  Unfortunately, it will not be possible to have a contingency trade agreement in place, either between Ireland and Britain or between the EU and Britain, in the short term.  This is why the British Government published its contingency plan regarding tariffs and the approach on the island of Ireland in the context of a no-deal.  If a no-deal happens, Ireland and the EU and the UK will act independently of one another to protect markets, but it will be a very difficult period if that happens.  As I said, we are in the process of finalising a detailed and significant plan to support farming through a no-deal, should it happen.  The supports for farmers have already begun.  In the most recent budget there was a package of approximately &euro;78 million for farmers.  I think about 830 farmers from Tipperary have applied for the new beef support programme, which is a &euro;20 million plan, but we need to be straight with people here.  If a no-deal Brexit happens, the pressures on agriculture and farming in Ireland will need a significant Government and EU response, and they will get that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200007#E00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I welcome the Government's commitment but I must reiterate that there is a high level of fear and trepidation throughout the agriculture industry.

The plan and the extremely faulty process associated with it have been subject to questions and concerns.  Those questions have yielded few answers to date.  The provision of effective and affordable broadband services across the country is, of course, a priority.  We are, however, yet to be convinced that the provision of such services will be done in a cost-effective, transparent and sustainable way.<\/p>  <p>  Serious concerns have been raised about the ability of the single remaining bidder, a consortium led by a US investment fund, to deliver on the project in the medium and long term.  As a country, we are proposing to heavily subsidise the construction of a network that the private sector will then own.  The same consortium, Enet, managed the metropolitan area networks, MANs, contract up to relatively recently.  During that time, there was an absence of price transparency and we had some of the most expensive broadband in Europe.  We cannot afford to heavily subsidise infrastructure only to find that it is underused.  <\/p>  <p>  While we were initially told the cost of the national broadband plan would be around &euro;500 million, the Government and departmental officials have now conceded that the ultimate cost will be multiples of that figure.  I expect the T&aacute;naiste will respond with arguments about the importance of servicing rural Ireland.  Will he guarantee that rural Ireland will not suffer as a result of initiatives being removed from Project Ireland 2040 to pay for the national broadband plan?  The lack of competitive tension in the process, with only one remaining bidder, raises the question of whether the Government is certain the process is robust.  If it proceeds, will it be the best possible deal?  Is there a plan B or are we likely to be bounced into something that looks like it will cost billions rather than hundreds of millions of euro purely because we have supposedly gone too far in a flawed process?  This smacks of lessons not having been learned from the national children's hospital shambles.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has previously warned that the national broadband plan may not proceed if there is a no-deal Brexit.  We all hope such a scenario will not arise.  If the national broadband plan is a casualty of a no-deal Brexit, could that mean, given its importance, that Project Ireland 2040 will require a complete revision?  How much has been set aside in Project Ireland 2040 for the national broadband plan?  I ask that question given the Government has conceded that the national broadband plan will cost multiples of &euro;500 million.  From where is the extra money likely to come?  What other projects earmarked in Project Ireland 2040 are likely to suffer as a result of the significant extra funding that will be required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200009#G00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1554212100,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The national broadband plan, as the Deputy knows, aims to ensure every home, school and business in Ireland, regardless of how remote or rural, has access to high-speed broadband.  We all have a responsibility to work to that end.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across Ireland and a State intervention in those areas, mostly rural, where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest.  The national broadband plan has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  In 2012, fewer than 700,000, or 30%, of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high-speed broadband.  Today, 74% of premises can access high-speed broadband.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has said that he wants to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible.  He has stated he will bring a proposal to Government for approval before Easter, in other words, in the next couple of weeks.<\/p><p> The ultimate cost to the State of delivering high-speed broadband to more than 500,000 premises in the intervention area was always going to be determined by the procurement process relating to the national broadband plan.  This was part of its design and enables the subsidy required to be identified in advance of the Government making a final decision to proceed.  We will, therefore, be making a decision with our eyes wide open in respect of cost.  It is clearly not going to be cheap.  We will now have to make a decision on whether we want to proceed.  The cost is high due to the significant ambition of the project and the scale of the build.  This one-off intervention will provide broadband to approximately 540,000 premises and will involve the laying of fibre along more than 100,000 km of road across 96% of the landmass of Ireland.  It will result in high speeds of 150 Mbps, which will increase to 500 Mbps by the tenth year.  The customer charge needs to be the same in rural and urban areas.  The plan involves operating the network in a future-proofed way for the next 25 years.<\/p> <p> The Minister is trying to ensure that the test the Deputy suggests, that this be cost-effective, transparent, and sustainable into the future, will be met.  He will have to bring a proposal before Cabinet and we will need to make a collective decision.  I suspect there will also be a lot of outreach to other parties in this House to ensure that this is done in a fully transparent way.  If we make the decision to go ahead with the plan, we will be investing with a full understanding of what it will cost and of what we will get for that expenditure over the next 25 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200009#G00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554212400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste did not answer any of my questions.

The company is also considering\u00a0the potential for a significant\u00a0additional investment which would increase capacity for cruise liner berthing to over 200 ships.  Consideration of that investment is at an early stage and would be conditional on some factors outside of\u00a0Dublin Port's control, such as securing the necessary finance and securing long-term guarantees from the cruise industry.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the wider tourism\u00a0industry,\u00a0in my meeting with the company, I emphasised the need for the Dublin Port Company to take account of the broader impacts of its commercial decisions.  This includes the effect on sectors supporting the cruise tourism industry or serving cruise visitors, not just in Dublin but in other ports and associated regions.  While Dublin Port is important in attracting cruise liners to Ireland through Dublin, the benefits that accrue to other ports around our coast are significant.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, Cobh continues as a dedicated cruise berth and will remain so post Brexit.  The Port of Cork is working with Belfast Harbour to see if it can take some of the additional business which may be lost as a result of Dublin Port's infrastructural works.  In addition,\u00a0F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the development and promotion of the\u00a0cruise tourism sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200017#P01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1554215700,"counter":123,"content":"<p>There is significant concern in the industry because of the 50% reduction in the number of cruise ships that will come into Dublin Port, as well as the reduction in their sizes.

The Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027 recognises the importance of\u00a0good governance for the effective and efficient running of sport and it includes\u00a0an action that Sport Ireland will oversee a process to have all national governing bodies and local sports partnerships, LSPs, adopt the governance\u00a0code by the end of 2021.  I, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and\u00a0Sport Ireland have made it clear that future funding for NGBs and LSPs will be conditional on compliance with the principles of the governance code.\u00a0 After 2021, NGBs and LSPs that are not fully compliant with the code will be at serious risk of losing their Sport Ireland funding and will be required to explain their position.<\/p>  <p>  While I have had no direct engagement with the association mentioned by the Deputy regarding its compliance with the governance code, at my direction, officials\u00a0in my Department contacted\u00a0the association\u00a0to\u00a0underline the importance of\u00a0introducing maximum term limits for members of its board.\u00a0\u00a0A decision on term limits was taken in early February at an extraordinary general meeting of the association and brought the association into compliance with one of the requirements of the governance code.\u00a0 The association is not yet fully compliant with all of the requirements of the code.\u00a0 In the current circumstances, I would\u00a0welcome full compliance sooner rather than later.\u00a0 Clearly, the recent media reports regarding the organisation have raised serious questions about governance and financial controls in the organisation.

The transfer of the co-ordination unit to Limerick will reduce the quality of the service as it was a bespoke service that operated six days per week.

The quality of service provided by Clare Accessible Transport is above the national standard but the tendering process does not recognise that fact or that this integrated service is flexible and a community-based service that links with the HSE, disability services, hospitals and the people it transports.  This delivers the bespoke service that is required but which is not being picked up in a tendering process.  The flexibility and integration elements were not picked up in a tendering process, which is the difficulty for Clare Accessible Transport.  It is also restricted in expanding its services.

It would have to wait for another review of the whole Dublin transport strategy, leading to a delay of two or three years, which we cannot afford.

The Deputy is aware of the current status of the MetroLink project both from my earlier answer and the briefing session the National Transport Authority arranged for Members last week.  The Taoiseach was correct in that the project has a great deal of appeal and all projects should be considered if they appear sensible on the surface, although they must come under serious examination.  There must be appropriate consideration in this regard.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in improving public transport in the city and the country.  Since publication of the emerging preferred route last year, the Deputy has been vocal in expressing his views and the views of some of his constituents about those initial proposals that had been put forward by the NTA.  The views of everyone\u00a0who made a submission to last year&rsquo;s consultation process, all 8,000 of them, were carefully considered by the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland and they informed the development of what is now known as the preferred route.  Members of the public and in this House now have another opportunity to make their views known on this route and I encourage them to do so.<\/p><p>I have heard various metro routes proposed by people in recent months and I have no doubt more will be proposed in the coming weeks.  However, proposals are sometimes put forward for areas where the population and transport demand levels now and in the future simply do not need metro levels of service: many areas, including those mentioned by the Deputy many times, can be very adequately served by\u00a0other high quality public transport options that can be delivered at lower levels of cost and disruption.<\/p><p>It is well recognised internationally that transport planning, particularly of this city-region scale, cannot be undertaken on the basis of an individual Deputy's preferences or disparate ideas.  It has to be rationally and logically planned with careful evaluation of the actual transport needs and the capacity required to meet those needs.  The Deputy would appreciate this, having being involved with decisions of this sort.  I know he supports such a process: he made similar comments in the House last week.  It is why a previous Government with which he is not unfamiliar introduced the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, which established what we now know as the NTA.  It is why that Act requires the NTA to develop a 20-year transport strategy, covering all modes and the entire greater Dublin area.  It is why that Act stipulates stringent requirements upon the NTA to consult\u00a0the public, the Oireachtas and local authorities in developing that strategy.  It is why that Act requires the draft strategy be submitted to the Minister to allow the Minister make his or her views known and, if necessary, amended before it is approved.  The Deputy knows that the establishment of this statutory framework was long sought and long fought.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>I really fear we are trying to undo the hard-won progress that we have made in terms of strategic transport planning.  I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s desire for better public transport and I share it.  I do not, however, believe we serve the interests of anybody in attempting to up-end a carefully constructed strategic framework designed to look well into the future and plan our transport infrastructure needs.  The Deputy&rsquo;s ideas on different possibilities may well be worth consideration and that consideration will be given, but it must be given within the framework that exists.<\/p><p>When the NTA starts reviewing the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, as it is obliged to do\u00a0every six years, in accordance with the Act, all options are on the table.  That review must be completed by 2021, so work will start during 2020 on it.  Last week the Deputy in this House reiterated his desire not to hold up MetroLink and\u00a0I share that desire.  I\u00a0also have no desire to interfere in the improvements that have been introduced, and which the Deputy supports, to how we strategically plan for our transport future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200020#S00900","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1554218100,"counter":167,"content":"<p>What the Taoiseach referred to is a variation in the possible route for the metro on the south side.

There is a real case to be made for Terenure-Rathfarnham but we can put that to one side because the Taoiseach has done so and concentrate on the UCD-Sandyford option because that has various characteristics.  First, there is very high demand for transport.  Second, it is a variation in the sense that it would address the long-term objective, which is already set out in the transport strategy, of upgrading the capacity capability of the green line.  The Minister will know this more than anyone else because it is his constituents who will be discommoded if that was to be put back 20 years in respect of what the alternative possible approach would be now.  I know the NTA is concerned and feels that under its legislative measures, it could not look at any variation because its statute requires it to do a full transport strategy and so on.  That is why I asked the question.  In respect of the Government coming to the view that there is something to be gained by not waiting 20 years to address that capacity issue on the green line and looking at the other routing because it also brings major transport benefits, from day one, it would see very high patronage and does not have any of the disadvantages referred to about low patronage areas.

It needs to consider what it must to do to assist the NTA to be able to look at that option so that rather than it being a two-phase process, when that tunnelling machine comes through and finally comes to rest in Ranelagh, as is currently proposed, it does not stop there but continues straight on towards Donnybrook, UCD, Stillorgan and Sandyford.  In that way, it would bring a number of transport benefits, including the fact that we would be able to cope with the long-term growth on the green line.  Does the Government have no responsibility to help progress that?  I believe it does.

In that regard it is not possible at this time to provide the Deputy with a date for the publication of the final report.<\/p><p>I would, however, note that it is in no way unusual for the report not be finalised at this stage.\u00a0 It is important that the investigation be thorough while also being as expeditious as possible, both to fulfil the national and international legal obligations on the AAIU and, indeed, out of respect for those who tragically lost their lives.  For example, when the AAIU investigated EC-ITP, the Metroliner that crashed at Cork Airport on 10 February 2011, the final report was published\u00a0on 28 January 2014.  For international comparison, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the UK investigated an\u00a0accident involving a\u00a0Super Puma helicopter, registration G-REDL, which crashed in the UK on 1 April 2009.  The final report was published on 24 November 2011.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House  <\/i><\/p><p>The Accident Investigation Board Norway investigated an EC 225 Airbus Helicopter, which crashed on 29 April 2016.

The Irish Air Line Pilots Association, which says it has been highlighting this matter for more than a decade, stated around the same time that it was seeking an early meeting with the Minister to address these issues.  Did it get this meeting?  The first interim report called on the Minister to conduct a thorough review of oversight of search and rescue operations.  In January, he said he had initiated a review, work on which was ongoing.  Essentially, these issues have been raised since a 2010 audit but the gaps remain.

My Department immediately set about commissioning a report by suitably qualified independent experts with strong international experience.  The review process and the report were also the subject of peer review by various search and rescue entities in other jurisdictions.  The report was published on the departmental website on 21 September 2018.  There was a follow-up to the report on oversight of SAR aviation.

In particular, I would like him to comment on the following characteristics of the Irish Aviation Authority.  Is the IAA good for oversight?  Uniquely among national aviation authorities, the IAA is not subject to legislation on freedom of information is not subject to investigation by the Ombudsman, has a commercial mandate in aviation and has the power to write its own statutory instruments without direct input from an elected body.  I am deeply concerned by the lack of an independent aviation safety oversight regime and the fact that the IAA has a variety of characteristics that would appear to work against its being effective and transparent.  In the specific case of Rescue 116, there are issues with rescue and oversight.  IALPA, which represents the pilots at the coalface of this, has been asking the Minister these questions.

Over the years, the programme has transformed the sporting landscape of the country, with new and improved facilities and equipment in practically every community.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 round of the sports capital programme closed for applications in October, with a record 2,337 applications submitted, seeking a total of &euro;162 million in funding.  Of these applications, 186 were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme but in respect of which corrected documents were submitted subsequently.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7 million in allocations to 170 projects was announced on 17 January.  This is something Deputy Heydon and others sought, and it was very well received by the applicants in question who would otherwise still be waiting for funding.  We were glad to facilitate this funding.<\/p>  <p>  Work is now under way on assessing the new 2018 applications.  For the first time, applicants who have submitted incorrect documentation under this round will be given the opportunity to correct their applications during the assessment period.  Many Deputies, including Deputy Heydon, have raised this matter in the past.  We were very glad to introduce this facility in the new round to give people who apply for sports capital grants - volunteers mainly - an opportunity to have their applications fully assessed and not invalidated.  While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed.  Accordingly, I expect that it may be the third quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the sports capital programme is announced.  However, there are a number of non-personal sports equipment grants within this number, and we hope in the coming weeks to be able to make allocations to over 600 clubs that have applied for those grants, if possible.  This would be helpful to many clubs coming into the summer period.<\/p>  <p>  In answer to the final aspect of Deputy Heydon's question, as soon as we make the final allocations under the 2018 round of the sports capital programme, which I hope will be in autumn, we will carry out a full review of the 2018 round with a view to initiating the opening of the next round of the programme.

Project Ireland 2040 states the priority funding objective regarding mainline rail is the maintenance and renewal of the existing network so that it continues to provide a safe and reliable\u00a0infrastructure enabling the provision of quality rail services for passengers across the country.

It will deliver benefits to passengers across the network, including Westmeath, by allowing for increased levels of investment in things like signalling, ballast cleaning and track relaying.  That will improve passenger journey experiences and may lead to better journey times.  Another key area of interest for Westmeath rail commuters is the need for increased capacity and services.

This encompasses areas that are not on the Wild Atlantic Way route but that are part of the wider hinterland.  The\u00a0main growth opportunity for these areas\u00a0is to attract the visitor already coming from or going to the Wild Atlantic Way.\u00a0 The Lee Valley has been designated part of the Wild Atlantic Way region and is included in all of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's development, promotional and business-support activities.  The agency\u00a0will be working with businesses on the ground and hosting a number of workshops in the\u00a0area.\u00a0 At these workshops it will explain how opportunities can be maximised and how to make the most of the Wild Atlantic Way region brand.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also currently\u00a0reviewing\u00a0their itineraries on the Wild Atlantic Way website.\u00a0\u00a0It will be working with tourism businesses in the Wild Atlantic Way region to showcase experiences on\u00a0the new Wild Atlantic Way website later this year to create an awareness of these experiences and grow visitor numbers to the area.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I understand that Tourism Ireland is working with Cork Airport and tourism industry partners to highlight Cork as a stand-alone destination and also as a gateway to both the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  In this context, Tourism\u00a0Ireland\u00a0recommends that tourism businesses from the Lee Valley register on the industry opportunities website for a range of opportunities to promote their businesses across the world.

While the plans sound great, they are not being translated into action in the way the Minister of State indicated.  Will he outline the detail of the promotion of the region or the timeline of when it will take place?  There is great urgency in the Macroom and wider Lee Valley area.

There needs to a collaborative approach between industry, local communities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Cork County Council.  In recent years, there has been a devolution of authority in respect of tourism development to local authorities.  That is very welcome because the ground-up approach is very important and preferable to the national agencies being responsible for everything.  I have seen some really positive developments all over the country in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I draw to the Deputy's attention a scheme that was launched last week.  It is aimed at creating destination towns.  The concept is to get people to stay longer and spend more in areas that have not traditionally been considered locations for tourism and in which people have not traditionally tended to seek accommodation.  The point of this is to develop authentic and off-the-beaten-path experiences.  This scheme would suit the Lee Valley area very well and I encourage the Deputy to liaise with Cork County Council, which has a responsibility to apply to that scheme in respect of potential candidate towns.  That is one avenue.<\/p><p> When F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland get in contact with the Deputy as a result of today's discussion, I advise him to ensure that there is ongoing collaboration.  In my experience, one builds a product through constant collaboration and co-operation between agencies and all stakeholders.

It would be helpful to examine what people there are doing and the model they have applied.  The Munster Vales to the Deputy's east have done brilliant work in recent years.

Phase 1 has resulted in a significant increase in passenger numbers.  Phase 2, which is due for implementation in the middle of 2019, includes a new service between Ringaskiddy and Cork Airport via Ballygarvan and Carrigaline.

The Government realised in the course of the general election campaign that something had gone wrong and that was not what the Government intended.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who was a Minister of State at the time, stated that the matter was so serious that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, would begin an investigation.  The investigation has now gone on longer than any tribunal and we have never been informed of the outcome.<\/p>  <p>  There have been numerous announcements by Ministers of State over the time, including Deputies Jim Daly and McHugh, but there has been very little progress.  We had a meeting here last year and it was promised that we would meet the Minister for Health, the Secretary General and the chief officers of the HSE but that never happened.  The Minister of State at the Department of health, Deputy Jim Daly, attended that meeting and gave what he thought was good news but nothing has happened since.

Unfortunately, the Minister of State is unable to be here because he is attending an important meeting with senior officials about scheduled and unscheduled care and delayed discharges.  He has asked me to convey his apologies to the Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar, Ramelton Community Hospital and Lifford Community Hospital.  Community hospitals are an essential part of our national infrastructure and we are determined to maintain our public stock.  The standard of care delivered to residents in these units is generally very high but we do recognise that many public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.  However, without these units, many older people would not have access to the care they need.  On that basis, we need to upgrade our public bed stock.  This is the aim behind the five-year capital investment programme for community and nursing units announced in 2016.<\/p><p>This provides the framework to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.<\/p> <p> At a meeting on 7 November 2018 with public representatives and local delegations, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, advised that the policy position to replace St. Joseph's, Stranorlar, and Ramelton community nursing unit had been revised.  The HSE's social care directorate and its national capital and property steering group accepted recommendations from HSE CHO1 to retain and upgrade both facilities, in the context of future capacity requirements.  This revises the original decision to replace the existing long-stay residential beds on both sites.  It further revises the scale of the proposed new unit at Letterkenny from the original 130 beds to 110 beds.  Importantly, the decision to revise the proposals was informed not just by the technical and feasibility studies on the physical infrastructure at these two sites but also a broader analysis of population projections and national planning norms carried out by the HSE.<\/p> <p> The redevelopment of the Lifford unit on the existing site is not deemed viable.  The need for additional beds and the potential to develop a new facility on a greenfield site will be reviewed further post-2021, when new census data are available and the capital programme has been advanced.  The existing unit at Lifford will continue to operate in the intervening period.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, advised at the November meeting, he welcomes the community continuing to engage with the HSE at local level, as appropriate, regarding further ideas and proposals for community-based options that may be considered.<\/p> <p> The Department and the HSE are engaged in a process to finalise the HSE's capital plan for 2019.  In developing its capital plan for 2019 and future years, the HSE must consider a range of issues, including the expenditure that is contractually committed, the HSE's annual requirement for meeting risks associated with clinical equipment, ambulances and healthcare infrastructure and the total capital Exchequer funding required for major capital projects.  The HSE's capital plan will determine the projects that can progress in 2019 and beyond and this plan is being finalised.

It states the HSE is still working on the plan for 2019 and also refers to expenditure on contractual commitments.  There is nothing clear in it to state funding will be provided for any of the units in Donegal.  I hope the Minister of State will bring it to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, that while he tried to impress on us that it was totally clear it would be moving in 2019, he also stated there were contractual commitments and annual requirements on meeting risks with associated clinical equipment.  This is not clear.  We are looking for a very clear and unambiguous statement that money will be provided for a design team to be appointed as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has made it very clear, and I admire his honesty, that the decision was reversed.

People are saying, \"show me the money\".  The problem is that not a penny has been sanctioned for the work to be carried out in Ramelton or at St. Joseph's.  This is the issue.  It is the start of April and it still has not been sanctioned.  In December, the Cabinet met for three hours and sanctioned hundreds of millions of additional euro for the national children's hospital.

They need to see the works commenced, the plans designed and the funding allocated.  I want to zone in specifically on the situation with regard to Lifford Community Hospital.  The response from the Minister of State today, and the responses we received previously, indicate that the Government does not plan to upgrade the existing hospital on the existing site, that the Government does not see it as viable but that it has no plans to look until after 2021 at what the future might hold.  Councillor Gerry Crawford in the area has done lot of work on this.  He raised it as recently as the March meeting of the HSE's health forum.  Again, he was told it will be 2021 before the Government looks at future plans for Lifford Community Hospital.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the HSE to start to identify a new site in Lifford so work and planning can commence to ensure there is a community hospital and long-term beds in the Lifford area to serve the community there as well as the communities in Stranorlar and Ramelton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200027#Z00400","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1554221700,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I apologise that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, cannot be here.

Of course, we must listen to their views and I will bring his concerns to the Minister.  His fundamental question on where those patients will go is very relevant.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to what Deputy Doherty has said, we accept the old plan has gone.

The national development plan provides for the continuation of the programme of replacement and refurbishment of community nursing units and long-term residential care facilities for older people.  The Department has consistently stated that the HSE is responsible for the delivery of healthcare infrastructure projects and it is a matter for the HSE in the first instance to prioritise and plan projects, subject to available funding in the coming years.  The Department and the HSE are engaged in a process to finalise the HSE's capital plan for 2019.  The HSE's capital plan will determine the projects that can progress in 2019 and beyond, having regard to the total available capital funding and relevant priority of each project.

Unfortunately, lengthy ambulance response times are not unusual there.  They are, however, unacceptable.  People in rural areas are treated deplorably when it comes to access to out-of-hours health services.  It is now evident that if more than one emergency arises at a time in the Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon area, our communities must wait up to two, three or four hours for emergency services.  The lives of people in the north west are as important as those of people in cities or elsewhere in the country.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that there are challenges in providing services in rural Ireland and that we cannot expect to achieve the same turnaround times as are experienced in urban areas.  However, the response times in rural areas could be and need to be vastly improved.  The waiting times for ambulances are too lengthy.  The current situation in County Leitrim in that regard is totally unsatisfactory.<\/p>  <p>  More and more ambulances are being called away to cover larger centres.  The dispatching of ambulances from one county to cover another due to the lack of paramedics on duty at any one time, as often occurs with the ambulances assigned to Leitrim and north Roscommon, is totally wrong and leaves people highly exposed.  Our ambulance service often deals with life or death situations but it does not have the capacity to deal with the call-outs it is receiving.  Fatalities may be inevitable.<\/p>  <p>  We need a new ambulance unit in Carrick-on-Shannon and extra personnel to manage the fleet there.  People in rural Ireland are losing confidence in the ambulance service, which is a pity because, as all Members know, its staff are dedicated, committed and very helpful.  I am sure that the families of several Members have called 999 seeking an ambulance - I know mine has.  It is sad that the staff are losing confidence, but it would be very sad if the people who need the service also lose confidence.<\/p>  <p>  The ambulance stationed in Carrick-on-Shannon serves south Leitrim and north Roscommon but at times may be as far away as Monaghan, Mayo, Tullamore or even Mullingar, leaving no ambulance cover in its primary area.  It is very alarming that there are only ever two ambulances on call for the entire County Leitrim.  Those ambulances may not be available if an emergency call comes in as they may be covering for other ambulances in urban centres or responding to other emergency calls.  What is more alarming is the lack of action on the part of the Government, which seems unconcerned about this issue or the fact that elderly people may have to wait from two hours to five hours for an ambulance.  People have contacted me with concerns and I have passed on those details to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that there is no short-term cover available for ambulance staff, meaning ambulance cover may be dropped if staff members are out sick as the minimum required number of staff members would not be met.  That is the sad reality.  Ambulance staff work around the clock, with a 20-hour shift not being unheard of for staff in the north west.  That is completely unsatisfactory and it is dangerous.  I am sure the Road Safety Authority does not condone unsafe practices such as the hours being worked by ambulance drivers.  I know exactly what I am talking about on this issue and the people who have been affected.  The current practice is wrong.  Those people are worn out.<\/p>  <p>  Access to out-of-hours health services in County Leitrim is extremely limited.  The HSE promised to implement measures in terms of new personnel, ambulances and first responder schemes in Leitrim and north Roscommon as advised by the 2015 capacity review that was published in 2016 for the National Ambulance Service.  Some 24 new recruits to the ambulance service were passed out quite recently, but all of them were posted to major urban centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200028#AA00100","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1554222300,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the very important issue of the ambulance service in the north-west region on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I thank Deputy Scanlon for raising it.  I am pleased to inform the House that 12 additional staff have been approved for deployment in the north-west region for 2019.  These staff will provide additional emergency capacity to the region in the coming year.<\/p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service has furthered several developments in order to address the issue of response times and ambulance cover in the north west.  In Border counties, the National Ambulance Service works closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in order to provide a more responsive service for patients.  An EU-funded pilot of a new community paramedic model of care in Border counties has been completed.  Community paramedics safely and effectively provide care in Border counties, with a consequent reduction in unnecessary ambulance journeys to emergency departments and hospital re-admissions.  On resources in the north west, under the first phase of the programme two community paramedics were assigned to Buncrana, County Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity review published in 2016 identified particular difficulties serving rural areas such as the north-west region.  It indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary community first responders, CFR, schemes.  The National Ambulance Service continues to work with local CFR groups across the region to enhance services.  I am pleased to state that the Government is fulfilling its commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the number of CFR groups year on year.  In the north west, 19 CFR groups are currently linked to the National Ambulance Service and 14 other groups there are in training to provide first response in emergency medical situations.<\/p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years and there have been several important service innovations and developments.  A single cohesive strategic plan for ambulance services, entitled Vision 2020, has been developed by the National Ambulance Service.  It sets out the actions necessary to implement the various recommendations and to address the range of other demands facing the ambulance service.<\/p>  <p>  The national emergency operations centre has been established and is the location for the receipt of emergency calls and dispatch of emergency resources.  The National Ambulance Service has visibility of all available paramedic resources and vehicles in real time, ensuring that the closest available resource is dispatched to an emergency.<\/p>  <p>  Other recent developments include the development of alternative pathways to care.  The \"hear and treat\" clinical hub went live in the national emergency operations centre in March last year.  It diverts some lower acuity patients away from busy emergency departments and frees up emergency capacity.  It is anticipated that such initiatives will help to improve the availability of ambulance resources nationwide, including in the north west.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, additional investment has been directed towards the National Ambulance Service.  This year, its budget increased to an unprecedented &euro;168.6 million, which will support it in continuing to deliver a high quality service throughout the country, including in the north west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200028#AA00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1554222300,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I welcome that 12 new recruits will be coming to the north-west region.  The current situation could not be allowed to continue because it is neither acceptable nor safe.  I have previously raised the first responder scheme in the House because it makes sense to roll it out in the north west.  Fire fighters in Dublin are trained to paramedic level, meaning that paramedics are available 24-7.  This should also be the case in the regions.  Last year, vital discussions on this issue took place between the National Ambulance Service and the national directorate for fire and emergency management.  I welcome the information provided by the Minister of State in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity review published in 2016 indicated that community first responder schemes are a practical way to improve first response times in rural areas.

As the population of the county is widely dispersed and because the ambulance based in Carrick-on-Shannon may be called upon to provide services to nearby centres such as Monaghan and, in particular, Mullingar, possibly to cover for an ambulance which may have been moved to Dublin, it is crucial that a second unit be based in Carrick-on-Shannon in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200028#AA00300","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1554222900,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.

It concerns Shannon Heritage and how it is enabled to run tourist attractions in County Clare, particularly Bunratty Castle and Folk Park.  The latter is an important component of Shannon Heritage and attracts international and national visitors throughout the year, numbering up to 350,000 annually.  Therefore, it is one of the leading attractions in Ireland.  It is the jewel in the crown of Shannon Heritage.  Shannon Heritage has a difficulty in regard to how it can fund the development of the attraction.<\/p>  <p>  Shannon Heritage is part of Shannon Group, which consists of Shannon Airport, Shannon Heritage, Shannon Commercial Properties and the International Aviation Services Centre, located at Shannon Airport.  Bunratty Castle and Folk Park is just one of the attractions that Shannon Heritage manages and develops.  It also looks after King John's Castle, Limerick, Craggaunowen, County Clare, Knappogue Castle and Walled Garden, and Dunguaire Castle, Kinvara.  It has expanded beyond the region to develop other attractions, including Malahide Castle and Gardens and the GPO Witness History heritage experience.  Therefore, Shannon Heritage has a broad portfolio.  It has to be commercially viable to exist.  This is the difficulty.  It has to generate income from its own resources, yet it is looking after many historical sites dating back centuries.  It has to maintain and develop these attractions with income it generates with very little State support, particularly from the museum service.  It is a custodian of historical sites but it is limited in its capacity to develop them.  The Government, therefore, needs to recognise the cultural significance of the portfolio Shannon Heritage looks after.<\/p>  <p>  Shannon Heritage currently has an &euro;8 million development plan in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The former will provide &euro;3 million and the latter &euro;5 million.  Shannon Heritage does not have the money for new acquisitions, yet it has to develop its own sites.  I ask that the State play a more active role in supporting Shannon Heritage as a custodian of our historical sites, the treasures of our country, and develop them into modern tourist attractions.  Bunratty Castle and Folk Park is running into difficulties and does not have a modern element.  It needs to be upgraded to attract visitors.<\/p>  <p>  Shannon Heritage is intimately connected to Shannon Airport.  Through the development of Shannon Heritage sites, we can increase the throughput in the airport.  As the Minister is well aware, Shannon Airport has the capacity to increase its numbers.  It has about 1.8 million visitors at present, and this number could be increased to 4.2 million.  Shannon Heritage is a component of how one can improve the number of passengers going through Shannon Airport.  I would like the Minister to respond to these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200029#BB00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1554222900,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Harty for raising this important matter.  I understood Shannon Heritage was flourishing and I believe it is flourishing.  From what Deputy Harty is saying, I understand it needs more support, not only to be the custodian of the portfolio he has so eloquently described but also to develop and encourage more tourism and ensure greater numbers of tourists.<\/p>  <p>  In line with its tourism development remit, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is responsible for developing and promoting the tourism potential of the various counties and regions of the country.  It does this primarily in line with the relevant tourism experience brands, which provide the overarching context for related marketing, enterprise supports and tourism product development.  <\/p>  <p>  Having just debated another issue with me during Priority Questions, the Deputy is probably a little bit tired of me saying somebody else is responsible for what he feels I should be able to do.  We have deliberately put in place State agencies to keep me and other Ministers semi-detached from the power to give grants and supports so they may be given in a way that cannot be interpreted as politically motivated.  What I have to say does not mean there is disinterest on my part in setting policy, which I do, but it is qualified by the fact that my unwillingness to identify and give direct support to a project is because political motivation might be suspect and I might be thought to be yielding to pressure from the Deputy in doing so.  God forbid that would ever happen.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Shannon Heritage, one of the companies owned by Shannon Group, is also heavily involved in the operation of tourist attractions at Bunratty and in the surrounding region.  Such attractions provide reasons for visitors to come to these parts of Ireland and for the Irish public to enjoy their own important sites and attractions.  Accordingly, Shannon Heritage's ability to attract visitors to the region is an important driver for the tourism sector, which, as we all know, is a key employer in our rural economies.  We are all indebted to Shannon Heritage for its contribution to Irish tourism and its enthusiasm and ability to attract visitors.  Since Shannon Group's establishment in 2014 as a commercial State body, I understand it has undertaken a significant restructuring of the Shannon Heritage company, invested some &euro;5 million in improving assets and heritage attractions, and managed to double visitor numbers over the same period.  It is a good story.<\/p>  <p>  I understand Bunratty Castle and Folk Park is Shannon Heritage's anchor attraction.  Since 2014, I am informed that the company has invested around &euro;2.5 million in upgrading the facilities at this site and has just commenced the planning phase for a major upgrade of the park, on which it has been liaising with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority.  In this regard, I am pleased to note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland awarded a stage one development grant of &euro;200,000 for this project under its large grants scheme &mdash; for technical assistance support.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that, in 2019, Shannon Heritage plans to continue to invest further in the heritage assets operated by the company, building on the work undertaken in previous years addressing the historical underinvestment prior to 2014.  I am pleased to learn that the company is working closely in partnership with Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland &mdash; particularly with the visitor attraction teams working on the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East &mdash; in addition to the local authorities, to enable further growth to visitor numbers to the mid-west.  I welcome the fact that Shannon Heritage is also collaborating with Clare County Council on its new tourism strategy.  It is the first time a local authority has partnered with another State company to create a tourism strategy, one which is focused on the dispersion of visitors around Clare to benefit all areas.  Working with all these partners, I am informed that Shannon Heritage's vision for the future is to be recognised as Ireland's leading operator and developer of tourist attractions, attracting 1 million more visitors annually by 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200029#BB00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1554222900,"counter":248,"content":"<p>We all have a lot to say on this issue and insufficient time to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200029#BB00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1554222900,"counter":249,"content":"<p>The Deputy has only two minutes in which to say it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200029#BB00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1554222900,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I understand that the Minister is involved in policy rather than the minutiae of developing tourist attractions.

Unfortunately, no copies of the full document were made available to public representatives of the neighbourhoods adjoining the park or to residents' associations.  I persuaded the awfully nice parks staff to give me a loan of a copy.  I know that a representative of the Navan Road residents' association has also got a loan of a copy.  I do not know what has happened in the OPW, but documents like this have simply not been made available.<\/p>  <p>  I have a number of suggestions to put to the Minister of State.  They could make the whole process much better and lead to very good consultation between citizens and the people who have been putting forward these proposals.  First, given that the two-week extension announced by the Minister is not enough, especially as the overall consultation period encompasses St. Patrick's Day and Easter, I suggest that the period be extended until the end of May so that this 200-page document can be examined in some detail.  Second, I suggest that copies of this document be placed in libraries and community centres in the areas surrounding the park.  This would give the public an opportunity to look at it.  Third, I suggest that the authors of the study meet and consult the public, residents' associations and others who are interested in the park.  The engineers involved in BusConnects, which was initially a computer desk-based survey, would confirm that the consultations which have been held in that instance have helped them to understand local geography and topography in various parts of Dublin.  I think a similar approach should be taken in the case of the Phoenix Park.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the document's description of the OPW as one of the stakeholders in the park because the OPW has been looking after the park for many years.  The document also suggests that the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is a stakeholder.  I do not know where the Department comes in.  The other stakeholder mentioned is F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The people of Ireland, including the residents of the areas of Dublin adjoining the park, are not mentioned on the list.  Given that the Government is all about spin and communication, it should appreciate that the Phoenix Park belongs to us all.  What is the Minister of State's vision of the purpose of this document?  Where is the budget provision for it?  There are many good proposals in it.  I have advanced many of them previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200030#CC00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1554223500,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Maybe we will hear what the Minister of State has to say about the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200030#CC00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1554223500,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Some of them, like the Magazine Fort project, have been undertaken or have been under way for a couple of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200030#CC00800","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1554223500,"counter":259,"content":"<p>The Phoenix Park is Europe's largest city park, comprising 1,752 acres.  It was first opened to the public in 1747 as a place of enjoyment for all the citizens of Dublin.  Today, the park is enjoyed by 10 million local, national and international visitors each year.  It plays a central role in the life of Dublin city.  It is a sanctuary from the city, an important sports, recreation and public amenity and home to a range of institutions, including &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, Dublin Zoo, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na headquarters and the US ambassador's residence.  As the world's urban population doubles from 3.5 billion to more than 7 billion over the next 40 years, parks and open spaces will become even more critical elements in the creation of vibrant cities and healthy communities.  Therefore, the Phoenix Park will be central to how Dublin city continues to evolve as a great place to live, work and visit.  From the local to the global, the Phoenix Park is beloved by Dubliners and international visitors alike.  This was borne out recently when it won various awards, including the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>best local attraction for 2019 and a gold medal at the 2018 world urban parks awards.<\/p><p>In 2018, with funding from its strategic partners F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Office of Public Works, OPW, commissioned a review of the visitor experience in the park.  The Phoenix Park visitor experience strategic review proposes a roadmap for how this amazing resource can make a greater contribution to the tourism economy through sensitive enhancement of visitor infrastructure, along with the preservation of its unique heritage features.  In this plan, the OPW seeks to realise the park&rsquo;s potential as one of the truly great parks of the world, while also ensuring the unique features which make up the park will be conserved and protected for the enjoyment of generations to come.<\/p> <p> Through a competitive tender process, Denis Byrne Architects was awarded the contract to undertake the review.  Its objectives and requirements were to review the future tourism development potential of the Phoenix Park, to prepare a development plan for the Phoenix Park visitor centre and to prepare a development plan for the Magazine Fort.<\/p> <p> The draft Phoenix Park visitor experience strategic review addresses the first objective, namely, to review the future tourism development potential of the Phoenix Park.  The review examines five zones in the park, considering themes of welcome, history and heritage, activity and well-being, as well as of identity, biodiversity and connectivity with the city in the context of the current and future potential visitor experience at the Phoenix Park.  The report sets out 29 recommendations which, if implemented, would increase the park&rsquo;s contribution to the tourism economy, while, at the same time, ensuring the unique character of the Phoenix Park is conserved and protected for the enjoyment of generations to come.  All recommendations will be subject to an OPW review, funding allocation and the statutory planning process.<\/p> <p> The second objective in the brief is to prepare a development plan for the Phoenix Park visitor centre.  The existing visitor centre complex is over 25 years old.  Up to 1.7 million visitors were recorded at the complex in 2018 and the existing facilities are no longer fit for purpose.  A new visitor centre is required which will provide interpretation of the park, caf&eacute;, retail and welfare facilities.  Sustainable transport and parking facilities will need to be provided to include buses, cars, cyclists and pedestrians.  Any developments or redevelopments proposed will be subject to the statutory planning process.<\/p> <p> With regard to the third objective, to prepare a development plan for the Magazine Fort, it is proposed to conserve the fort and open it as a living history experience unique in Dublin.  As part of the review, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Waterways Ireland and Dublin Zoo were consulted.  Currently, the public is being asked for its observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200030#CC00900","speaker":"1363","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554224100,"counter":261,"content":"<p>While the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposed extension is welcome, it is entirely inadequate.  In his response, the Minister of State never once mentioned the people of Dublin and the people of Ireland whose park this is.  Instead, he spoke about development which includes retail.  Why does the Phoenix Park need retail?  It is our premier environmental and ecological gem.  Is the Minister of State proposing that it will be turned into some kind of shopping centre for a visitor experience for people stepping off cruise ships?  People around the park do not want that.  We want artisan caf&eacute;s which employ local people and use Irish products.  We do not want large multinational companies dominating the significant tourism offering of the park.  Neither do we want it to cancel out the rights of Dubliners and the rest of the country who use the Phoenix Park.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will know some of the many songs associated with the park such as the &ldquo;Zoological Gardens&rdquo; and what one is likely to see at certain times.

It provides for interaction between the redress bodies and the National Archives to determine which records should be disposed of and which should be retained.  It also provides that on the dissolution of the bodies, their records are deemed to be records of the Department of Education and Skills and transferred to the custody of the National Archives; that on their transfer to the National Archives the records will be withheld from public inspection for a period of not less than 75 years; that access to the records may only be possible at that point when regulations are made by the Minister; and that a number of provisions of the National Archives Act 1986 will not apply to the records.  This mainly covers the disapplication of provisions that govern access by individuals and Government Departments.<br\/><br\/>The historical context for this Bill is important.  It is almost ten years since the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse published its final report, popularly known as the Ryan report.  The commission was established in an atmosphere when the scale of abuse in the residential institutions was only becoming known.  However, without the benefit of the commission&rsquo;s work and the testimony given to it, the truth of what happened in these institutions might never have been made public.  <br\/><br\/>The commission and the Residential Institutions Redress Board, which was established to provide financial redress to survivors of abuse, are key elements in the State&rsquo;s response to institutional child abuse.  The Ryan report is an exemplary work which rigorously charts the history of the residential institutions.  It exposes the scale and systemic nature of the abuse which was perpetrated within them and the failings of those who managed and supervised the institutions in allowing this abuse to continue to take place.  While those institutions no longer exist, it is important that the history of institutional abuse is preserved and not forgotten.<br\/><br\/>It is also important that those who suffered abuse were provided with redress.  As I have said, the Residential Institutions Redress Board provided financial awards to those who suffered abuse, while the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee provided for the independent review of such awards where applicants so wished.  The redress board has virtually completed its work, with just a very small number of cases yet to be finalised.  Some 16,650 applications to the redress scheme were accepted, with 15,600 awards offered to survivors or their families.  Costs of &euro;1.25 billion will have been incurred under the redress scheme, including awards, legal costs of applicants and administration costs.<br\/><br\/>The national counselling service and the family tracing service provided by Barnardos are other important elements of the State&rsquo;s response and are available to former residents.  Funding of &euro;12.7 million was provided to the now dissolved Education Finance Board to enable it to provide grants and supports to former residents and their relatives to assist them in accessing educational services.  The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, which operates under the name of Caranua, was established in 2012.  Caranua administers the fund of up to &euro;110 million pledged by the congregations as part of their contribution to the costs of redress.  To date, it has expended some &euro;91 million, including administration costs, engaging with and funding supports for survivors.  It has received more than 6,500 applications and more than 5,000 individuals have received support.  <br\/><br\/>In addition to these measures, my Department has engaged professional facilitators to support the planning of consultations with survivors on their experiences of redress and on how they might be supported into the future.  My Department has also convened an interdepartmental committee to examine how existing State services can support the needs of survivors.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the nature of the records to which the Bill refers.  These are highly sensitive and personal documents.  The records of the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the review committee are essentially the applications for redress made by individual former residents.  These records would include much personal data, including, for example, detailed family information regarding the individual applicant and perhaps others such as parents, siblings, spouse or children.  They could include details of the circumstances leading to the individual being placed in a residential institution and details of the abuse suffered in the institution and its impact, etc.  Detailed medical and psychological reports regarding the individuals which may also be on file.  The views, if any, of the relevant management body on individual applications made to the redress board may also be included, together with papers regarding the determination of a redress award.  The records are also likely to include information regarding alleged perpetrators of abuse, based on the information provided by victims.  This information was not contested and the individual against whom an allegation was made may not be aware that such information exists in the records.<br\/><br\/>The records of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse contain the papers of both the commission&rsquo;s investigation committee and its confidential committee.  This includes personal testimony of former residents, members of congregations and other individuals who testified before the commission.  Again, this testimony contains details of abuse of various forms and committed by various persons.  It was certainly the view at the time of the establishment of the commission that, without assurances of confidentiality, it would have been very difficult to persuade people to engage with the commission.  Without that engagement, the light which the Ryan report shone on the abuse would have been dimmed significantly.  <br\/><br\/>It is, I hope, apparent from this summary of the very sensitive and highly personal nature of the records in question why mechanisms to ensure confidentiality, including the disapplication of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts, were enshrined in the legislation establishing the bodies.  The Acts in question are the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.<br\/><br\/>The ultimate protection provided in the Acts was for the disposal and destruction of the records of the bodies once they had completed their work and prior to their dissolution, which is also provided for in the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  However, it is also the case that, with the growing state of knowledge about institutional abuse, to which the work of the commission and redress board made a significant contribution, concerns arose in relation to the destruction of the records.  In this regard, a motion on the Ryan report, which was adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12 June 2009, noted &quot;the desirability that, in so far as possible, all of the documentation received by and in the possession of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is preserved for posterity and not destroyed.&quot;<br\/><br\/>The Ryan report is a comprehensive account of the extent of the abuse that was perpetrated and its impact on the individuals concerned.  However, even in some 2,500 pages, it could not tell the many personal stories of those affected.  Retention of the records will ensure that these stories are kept.  The records also contain testimony from those involved in the operation and supervision of the institutions.  This is information which is also of great significance in understanding this dark period in our history.  These are, therefore, historically important records which could, in time, become primary source material for historians and family members seeking to undertake genealogical research or simply to understand what their father, mother or other relatives suffered while in an institution.  <br\/><br\/>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the current legislation, which would see the records destroyed, to establish a new Act, which would seek to balance the need to retain the confidentiality that was promised to those who provided personal information with the need to preserve what are important historical records.  There is no doubt that the question of destruction of the records - the current <i>status quo<\/i>- or retention is complex.  The timing of release is also significant.  On the one hand, it requires weighing in the balance the original assurances of confidentiality, the associated provision for the destruction of the records and the sensitive and personal nature of the records.  On the other hand, due consideration must be given to the wider public interest in ensuring that the history of child abuse in the residential institutions is preserved.<br\/><br\/>I am aware that when the draft scheme of the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny, there was significant concern about what would be the impact on individuals if the records were released.  Some of those concerns have been amplified by the coming into force of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Cognisance of those concerns has been reflected in the drafting of the Bill and in the context of the data protection impact assessment which my Department will publish in due course.<br\/><br\/>I am also aware that there is a spectrum of views.  Some favour disposal of the records, some want their immediate release and others support retention for varying periods and-or release with redaction.<br\/><br\/>These matters required careful consideration and that consideration has been given in the development of the Bill before the House today.  The Government has been supportive of the intention behind the D&aacute;il motion and has been anxious to give that intention effect in a way which takes account the sensibilities and rights of those persons who are named in the records.<\/p><p>The result of that consideration, which includes significant legal advice, is that the records should be retained and transferred to the National Archives, but that they should be withheld from public inspection for a lengthy period.  This period is specified in the Bill before the House today as being at least 75 years.<\/p> <p> I will now address the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill is short and contains only 11 sections, a number of which are standard provisions.  I will now outline them.<\/p> <p> Section 1 defines the terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides a mechanism for the disposal of records not requiring to be retained.  As would be expected in archival processes, not all the records of the bodies will warrant preservation.  For example, there will be routine administrative records on file.  Decisions in regard to the disposal are, in my view, best left to the bodies themselves with the director of the National Archives having the final say in the matter.  Under this section, the bodies will certify that particular records or classes of records are not required to be retained and the director, on being satisfied that the records in question do not warrant preservation, may grant an authorisation for their disposal.  Records must be disposed of confidentially.  These provisions are similar to those in section 7 of the National Archives Act 1986 and reflective of the normal practice the National Archives would go through when assessing records for preservation.  The section also provides for the inspection of records by the director and for the making available to the director by a body of records for the purposes of the section that may otherwise be prohibited from being disclosed.  This provision is required in order to overcome the restrictions on access set out in existing legislation.<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides that the records of the three redress bodies will, on the dissolution of the bodies, become records of the Department of Education and Skills and be transferred to the National Archives.  The records will then be withheld from public access for a period of at least 75 years.  Release of the records will be contingent on regulations being made under section 6 of the Bill.  It is important to note that if no regulations are made, then the records cannot be released.<\/p> <p> As the records will come under the scope of the National Archives Act 1986, it is necessary to provide that the definition of \"archives\" in that Act should include a record transferred under section 3(1) of the Bill.  Section 4 makes provision for this.<\/p> <p> Section 5 provides that a number of sections of the National Archives Act 1986 will not apply to a record transferred under the Bill, while other sections will not apply during the sealing period.  This is to ensure the integrity of the confidentiality provisions.  Essentially, any provision of that Act that provides for access to records is being dis-applied.  For example, under the 1986 Act, a Department could retain a copy of a record transferred to the National Archives or could requisition records back from the National Archives.  This will not be possible in the case of these records.  Once records are transferred to the National Archives, they may not be disposed of during the period for which they are sealed.  The existing right of persons to inspect archives in the custody of the National Archives must also be dis-applied.  As the Bill contains provisions regarding the disposal of records and the transfer of records to the National Archives, the existing provisions set down in sections 7 and 8 of the National Archives Act are being dis-applied.<\/p> <p> I mentioned earlier that access could only take place if regulations are made and section 6 makes provisions for this.  Such regulations can be made no earlier than 12 months prior to the expiry of the 75 year period and following consultation with the director of the National Archives.  The regulations do not prescribe the specific issues that should be addressed in the regulations as it is not possible at this remove to specify what those issues might be.  As I mentioned earlier, the regulations will consider arrangements in regard to the release of the records based on the circumstances prevailing at that time, and not now.  However, the regulation making provision requires that the Minister of the day, when proposing to make regulations, must have regard to the impact that any resultant disclosure of information may have on the well-being and emotional state of persons alive at the date of the making of the regulations.  This enables any concerns that there may be that the release of the records may have an effect on persons still alive at that time to be taken into account.  Positive resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas are required before any regulations are made.<\/p> <p> Sections 7 and 8 provide for the removal of the existing power of the redress bodies, set down in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, under which the bodies would determine or make arrangements for the disposal of their records.  Other amendments to those Acts are also being made.<\/p> <p> Section 9 continues the existing restriction of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to records transferring under section 2(1).  Sections 10 and 11 are standard provisions dealing with expenses, citation and commencement.<\/p> <p> When the draft scheme of this Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny, the substance of concerns raised related to: the right to privacy; the right to a good name; and the issue of legitimate expectations of confidentiality.  I must stress again that these issues were given detailed consideration.  That is reflected in the measures in the Bill in respect of: the duration of the period of retention and the provisions in respect of the timing of the making of regulations; and the requirement to take into account the impact of release of records on persons alive at the time of the making of the regulations.<\/p> <p> Questions have also been raised as to why the existing provisions of the National Archives Act 1986 would not be sufficient.  I acknowledge that the National Archives Act 1986 provides for a certification process to limit access to records that could potentially be open for access after 30 years.  However, this provision does not give sufficiently robust assurances regarding the treatment of the records.  This is especially the case when account is taken of the fact that their retention represents a substantial change of approach relative to the process of destruction that is provided for in the existing legislation governing the bodies.  It is precisely for this reason that the lengthy withholding period is being proposed.<\/p> <p> I should at this point make it clear to the House that the records which are already extant in my Department in respect of industrial schools and reformatories do not come within the ambit of this Bill.  They will be treated under the general provisions of the National Archives Act as they apply to departmental records.  In addition, certain personal records of persons who were committed to industrial schools are held by my Department and are accessible under freedom of information.  That position remains unchanged under the Bill.<\/p> <p> Questions have also been raised as to whether the records might be released on an anonymised basis and consideration has been given to this approach.  However, it has a number of deficiencies which are as follows.  First, it would rob the records of much of their historical significance.  The Ryan report itself already presents an anonymised, or, to be strictly accurate, pseudonymised, account of the residential institutions and the abuse which took place within them.  Therefore, relative to that report, anonymising the records would take away much of the additional significance of the records themselves.  Second, anonymising the records would not be without risk that personal information could be revealed, either through an administrative error or by inference from the remaining content.  Lastly, the anonymisation of the records would represent a massive and costly undertaking, given that there are in excess of 2 million individual records involved.  This, of itself, would not be reason enough to rule out this approach, but in light of the other drawbacks I have alluded to, it must also weigh on the considerations.<\/p> <p> As I have said, there are arguments on both sides in favour of destruction or retention and on the timing of release of the records.  It is unlikely that those arguments will be conclusively resolved given the differences of view which have been expressed on the matter.<\/p> <p> The Government is, however, anxious to respond to concerns from survivors that their experiences will be forgotten.  That is why, on Committee Stage, I intend to bring forward a proposal to provide for a review of the operation of the Bill after 25 years.  While not being prescriptive, I envisage that such a review will provide an opportunity to look at the situation of survivors and at any developments in relation to the history of the various institutions in which abuse took place - a so-called \"archipelago of institutions\" which, regrettably, extends beyond those comprehended by this Bill.<\/p> <p> The Ryan report recommended that a memorial to survivors be erected.  Unfortunately the proposals for the erection of such a memorial on a site adjacent to the Garden of Remembrance on Parnell Square in Dublin failed to receive the requisite planning permission.  Memorialisation is a recurring theme for survivors of institutional abuse and while I would like to move forward with memorialisation in relation to the residential institutions for which my Department had responsibility, I see merit in taking a whole-of-government approach to memorialisation, especially given what we now know about the interconnectedness of these institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200031#DD02200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554225300,"counter":284,"content":"<p>The Minister will have to leave it there because he is out of time but we will be coming back to him, obviously, to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200033#FF00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1554225300,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I am sure there were important points the Minister was to make.

So much has been revealed in the past 25 years or so about child sexual abuse, particularly in the church and institutions, as well as some sporting bodies.  It must be stated that while it was revealed in the past 25 years, I have no doubt there was an acceptance in society for some of this.  People knew what was going on and turned a blind eye due to inappropriate deference to certain authorities, particularly the church and the State.<\/p>  <p>  We are really discussing the consequences of the Ryan report today.  That report showed that a failure on the part of the church and the State led to the systematic institutional abuse of children, with lives destroyed, maligned or ended as a result.  It is vital for future generations that the experience of those who suffered at the hands of those in positions of power is not lost.  Long after the victims have died, their testimonies will bear witness to a stark period in our country's history.  I know there has been some discussion about the merits and demerits of the Bill.  However, the fundamental merit of the Bill, and the reason we support it, is that these records will be publicly available.  Up to now, that has not been the case.  The Bill, therefore, represents a step forward.  In some ways, it implements the D&aacute;il motion from 2009 put forward by the Taoiseach of the day and subsequently accepted by all parties.  It sought that records would not be destroyed and this Bill allows the preservation of those records, which is important.<\/p>  <p>  We also recognise that the Bill comes about because of learning after the fact.  We also accept that the Bill brings challenges and compromises.  Having discussed the matter with officials and looked at the record of previous Ministers dealing with the legislation and the pre-legislative scrutiny, there were a number a compromises.  The Government is acting in good faith with the Bill.  I am not wedded to every aspect of the Bill and every time limit but I accept that the Government gave careful consideration to the matter before coming up with its proposals.  I am willing to listen to the debate to see what points can be made before we make a final decision.  We will certainly support the Bill on Second Stage and want it to move to Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, after the then Taoiseach, former Deputy Brian Cowen, met victims, the Government brought forward a motion to the effect that, where possible, the documentation of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse should be preserved.  Certainty with respect to these records was not guaranteed at the time due to legal advice.  The interviews and other records of these inquiries had been given in total confidence, and we must bear that in mind.  They were not initially intended for use in other forums, and that is why the Minister is bringing forward this required legislation.  These circumstances mean that we are in a difficult position and that the passing of this legislation will be difficult.<\/p>  <p>  The records held by the State were gathered for a particular purpose, which was to establish the facts in the inquiry, which did a fantastic job in that respect.  It brought this horror to our attention.  Let us be honest, however, as some of the facts that were in the report were quite well known to people in different communities where some of this abuse was taking place.  There is absolutely no doubt that the country turned a blind eye to it in that regard.  The records of the commission were originally to be destroyed following the completion of its work, as is standard.  However, following the findings in the report, there was broad acceptance that the testimonies and records provided in the creation of these reports were of vital historical significance.  The Ryan report is of vital historical significance.  I accept the Minister's point that the Ryan report goes into considerable depth and detail in what it describes of the horror and the historical position.<\/p>  <p>  After the Ryan report and following a meeting of the then Taoiseach and the victims, as well as the D&aacute;il motion, there was significant support for the retention of records.  Everybody in the House agreed that the records should be retained, and nobody stated that the original position should have obtained.  We will change that with the legislation, which is significant, and it should be acknowledged that this part of the Bill is not controversial and should be welcomed.  It is a positive decision to retain records, as if we do nothing or the legislation stalls, these records will not become public at any point.<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned the historical silence and the blind eye that was given to these scandals, so it would run counter to everything we have learned to destroy those documents.  It is vital that they be recognised as part of a history that some people may wish to forget; we should never forget it.  The question then becomes how we can achieve this while respecting the wishes of those who shared their experiences in total confidence so we could learn the truth.  We must put in place measures to ensure records of such importance are preserved, while simultaneously respecting the real stories and deeply personal testimonies of the individuals engaged with redress bodies.  I have been informed that the documents contain a number of allegations and that if they were published prematurely, the allegations might not stand the test of court action.  This is an avenue into which the Oireachtas should not lead the State.  Reopening matters with the accidental release of unredacted or incorrectly redacted information would be a grave disservice to all those who gave their time to this report and investigation.  Furthermore, in situations where survivors who participated in these investigations do not wish to disclose their personal experiences, we must respect and protect their wishes.<\/p>  <p>  I see some merit in the suggestion from certain campaigners that the records should be released in anonymised form.  I am willing to listen to the arguments for that, although I am also willing to listen to the counterarguments that the Minister might address if he is not willing to agree to that suggestion.  If I were making the decision, the first consideration would be the cost.  I presume any amendment put down in this respect would be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle because it would be a substantial cost to the Exchequer.  I wonder who would do the job in a confidential way, as it would be an absolutely massive undertaking.  Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to listen to the arguments on this but my initial instincts are not supportive.  Nevertheless, we can work collaboratively to get the right result in the end, or at least the best possible compromise.  Essentially, we are compromising on the legal advice.  The more information the Minister can give on that legal advice relating to the 75-year period, the more helpful it would be for the debate.  I know that, as a matter of course, the Government does not issue the advice of the Attorney General.  However, it would be extremely helpful for the Minister to go into as much detail as possible in that regard, either in his reply or on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has apparently raised concerns about the security of information if such a project of anonymisation was implemented and I share such concerns.  I also accept the point that the Ryan report goes a considerable distance in covering this matter, although it is not by itself the full record of the evidence taken in the process.  The Department has also raised concerns about the scale of the project and mistakes that could be made in the 2 million sealed records.  This is very understandable but, again, I am perfectly willing to listen to counterarguments, particularly on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has explained to us that the proposed 75-year limit is aimed at achieving the retention of these records and the protection of those who gave testimony, essentially ensuring that those involved will have passed away when the information is released.  The length of time in this legislation in no way diminishes the findings or the work of the commission, the residential institutions redress board and the review committee.  I pay tribute to those involved in that difficult work.  I will approach the legislation by understanding that this is an issue of compromise and everybody in this House wants to do right by the victims.  I would certainly be extremely cognisant of any legal advice that the Government has described in good faith for the 75-year period.  I know from various interactions that there are different views on this.  Some people representing victims can see the point while others totally disagree with it.<\/p>  <p>  We have already started the debate.  We will have a much more detailed debate on Committee Stage.  I look forward to that.  We will engage in the process in as constructive a fashion as is possible, with the needs of victims and history in our mind.  History has an awful habit of repeating itself.  We may all be horrified by child sexual abuse in this country but more people seem to pay no regard to what happened in Nazi Germany, for example.  Those lessons of history about that particular evil should be remembered and the lessons of history in this country about child sexual abuse should always be remembered.<\/p><p>There are so many competing reasons for the debate that will take place in respect of this Bill but first and foremost, it must be about the victims of this terrible abuse and ensuring it never happens again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200034#GG00100","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554226500,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  When debating it this evening, we need to be mindful that what we are discussing are the records of people's lives.  They are the records of hurt, abuse, violence, marginalisation and fear.  We need to be very careful about making decisions without adequate outreach to the survivors of abuse, their families and the advocacy groups that speak on their behalf.<\/p>  <p>  We obviously have concerns that without new legislation, the records will be disposed of with the dissolution of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee.  However, at the same time, to seal and withhold these records from public access for a period of 75 years raises question marks.  It seems an unreasonable period of time preventing any access.  I also worry about the reference in the Bill deeming the records to be the records or possession of the Department of Education and Skills and the proposal to transfer those records to the National Archives.  These records are the horrific lived experiences of the residents in all these institutions who suffered at the hands of this State.  They belong to the survivors and families and nobody else.  We must never forget what went on in these institutions or white wash them from our memory or that of future generations.  It is part of the past and we must acknowledge and face that.  We must remember that generation after generation will remember the pain and suffering caused at the hands of church and State.  Are we not doing this by locking these testimonies away for 75 years?  Are we nearly repeating the negative history all these people suffered?  We have had redress and the various schemes and apologies.  Are we now saying to these people that these records will be sealed for 75 years?  I know nobody wants the records to be destroyed.  That is fairly obvious but there must be some happy medium or way of meeting in the middle.  I know the Minister said there are mixed views or stories but I would say that the majority of survivors or certainly those from whom we have heard are very concerned about this and concerned that they are being failed again at the hands of the State.  They were obviously failed in the worst way possible but here we are in the same boat.  Some common sense must be applied here.  We need consultation with the survivors' groups and families and to look at whether there is some way of meeting in the middle.  A period of 75 years seems extremely excessive.  We do not want to cause even more hurt and add even more insult to injury to people who have already suffered so horrifically.  We will have more discussion on Committee Stage.  I welcome that but we need to look seriously at this to see if there is some way that we can avoid leaving it for a full 75 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200035#HH00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1554226500,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I want to express my very serious concern over this proposal to seal the records from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse for 75 years.  The Ryan report very clearly called for this valuable information to be preserved and not destroyed and that is correct.  On the back of that, there should have been widespread consultation with survivors and their families to reach some sort of consensus as to the future of these files.  As far as I can see, that did not happen and instead we are told that the Government is going to seal this material in the National Archives until almost 2095 thereby making it inaccessible for future generations.<\/p>  <p>  There is clearly an option that would involve either redacting or anonymising these files so that no individual can be identified.  How did the Government explore this?  I do not buy the excuse we saw reported recently in the media where the Department of Education and Skills claimed that anonymising these files would rob them of their historical significance.  The files would not be permanently altered.  Anonymised versions can be released and the full files released at a later date.  I do not see how releasing anonymised versions of the files could in any way undermine the right to privacy and confidentiality of those who engaged with the commission or the redress board.  I saw one survivor quoted in the media as describing the sealing of these files as another cover-up.  This person says she is aware of some survivors who want their files released after their deaths so that their families know what they went through.  She also notes that some survivors may have a very different view but they should at least have been asked.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister when he says it is essential to ensure that we never forget the abuse that was perpetrated against innocent children and that future generations can be made aware of and understand what took place but I fail to see how completely sealing these documents for the rest of the century and even after that and only making them available for scrutiny under very strict conditions in any way achieves that.

The Minister acknowledged that 75 years is a lengthy period of time.  It is a long time.  We have collectively acknowledged that those records should not be destroyed.  There is agreement on that.  I note the previous suggestion of colleagues that we should try to move towards some form of consensus because I think that might be possible.  In the period between now and Committee Stage, the wise thing to do might be to engage with survivors' groups because the survivors are concerned that this is an attempt by the State to cover up.  We should bear in mind that these people bear the scars of repeated cover-ups by the State and those who ran the institutions in which these people lived.  These people lack trust and for good reason.  This is nothing to do with any individual in this House.  History shows these people that where it is possible to cover up, a cover-up can and will happen.  We must remember that what is contained in these records are deeply personal stories of hurt, abuse and people who were treated horrendously at the hands of the men and women running these institutions.  While they may not be able to talk to their families about it while they are alive, they want their stories be available so that their families can understand what they went through.  There is a value in us having those stories to refer to.  It is really important that we never forget what happened and that those records would be available in a format that is sensitive to the needs to the survivors, be it in an anonymised or redacted format however that can be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in position is clear.  We will not oppose this legislation going on to Committee Stage but it is our intention to table amendments and to engage on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister to engage with the survivors' groups in the intervening period between now and Committee Stage.  I understand the Department does this in any event.  I also urge the Minister to examine what can be done.  He has heard the concerns of the people here this evening.  I ask him to examine what can be done for the survivors.  Some of them have taken to the media but the vast majority could never do this.  They are at home, they are worried and they believe they will be white washed out of history again.  That is a genuine concern so I urge the Minister to use the time between now and Committee Stage to engage with survivors and look proactively at what options can be explored in terms of making this information available and ensuring people's stories are not hidden or covered up, which neither the Minister nor anyone here wants to do.<\/p><p>There must be a way to handle this sensitively.

I am talking about Christine Buckley, who was in the Goldenbridge orphanage along with many other girls.  Anyone who knows the history of Goldenbridge knows that the children there were treated horrifically.  There was an ordinary day school beside it, and it is still there.  It is a very good school and is beside St. Michael's Estate in Goldenbridge.  In fact, one of the founders of Fine Gael is buried in the graveyard adjacent.  The second person I wish to mention is Mary Raftery, a very fine RT&Eacute; journalist who died far too young, as Christine Buckley did, and who played a key role in the production of the RT&Eacute; documentary series \"States of Fear\".  A number of other people wrote books about this.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin, when I was a small child and until about 20 or 30 years ago, if a little girl was bold she was warned she could end up in Goldenbridge, and if a boy misbehaved he was told he might go to Artane.  I think there are other Deputies here who know about this.  I recall that when I was first elected to the D&aacute;il some years afterwards, the question of what had been happening in these institutions became a public affair.  In the case of boys, the stories about Artane and the boys' band started to tumble out.  Of course, people took great pride in the band every all-Ireland final day.  There was the question of what happened in places such as Daingean and in Letterfrack.  All these institutions and many others besides were bywords for appalling savagery to children.  The children were beaten and starved.  Then, to add to all that, the revelations of sexual abuse gradually came out.  This is the background to the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  When I was in government, I recall advising the then Taoiseach that in no circumstances should the records be destroyed, that they are the lived history of all the people who lived in the institutions.  I therefore welcome the Bill.  At that point, however, the key was to ensure that the records were saved because, frankly, many people, for reasons of defence of the institutions involved in the abuse, wanted the records of what had happened and the evidence that had been given destroyed.  I therefore welcome the fact that the Minister and his Government have agreed to hold onto the records, but 75 years is too long.  It is so important that the stories and the information we know are passed on to our children and grandchildren in order that never again as a country will we live through this abuse and never in any of our names will it happen again.  I remember being amazed when all this information came out in the D&aacute;il that so many Members had simply never heard of the institutions.  They did not know.  I suppose they came from nice middle-class families.  The only institution middle-class people might have been put into was a psychiatric hospital.  Enough people were put into those as well.  We as a State institutionalised people.  The records are incredibly important as a testimony of the things that went wrong in Ireland as well as the many wonderful things and wonderful people.<\/p>  <p>  I really hope the religious orders are not acting as some kind of mental block on this information being revealed because, of course, not all the nuns and priests were abusers.  Many of them actually helped and looked after children and probably saved their lives.  However, there were many who beat, starved, disrespected and abused the children.  There are two sides of this story and we need to remember that.  It is not pleasant going back into it.  Many of the people who were personally affected are now much older and passing on, but from one and all I have heard, \"Please ensure that the records are not destroyed.\"<\/p>  <p>  I remember when the commission was set up.  It was a horrendous experience for many of the people who went to it in its first few years, particularly many of the men because they genuinely had never told anyone.  I think the women may have shared their experiences in the institutions a little more than the men did.  Of course, many of the boys who were in institutions, particularly if they were musical, found careers in the Army.  Many of the people who have served with such distinction in our Defence Forces got into the Defence Forces having left one of the institutions.  This is therefore a very complex history.<\/p>  <p>  Part of this opened up when children came back from America as young adults in the 1990s looking for their information because they had been adopted from Ireland and taken to America, and we now know an awful lot more about that.  They came to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I was Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development at the time and Dick Spring was both T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Essentially, with the help particularly of the civil servants in the Department, but also of the people in the National Archives such as Ms Catriona Crowe, those records were saved.  They could have been put in a skip and just lost.  Those people in many cases therefore got access to their records.  We know from the story of Philomena and her son how difficult a process this was.<\/p>  <p>  We are living in a different era now, and the Minister is right to be cautious because these are people's very personal data.  I honestly put it to the Minister, however, that the period of 75 years is excessive and uncalled for.  The National Archives provide for a period of 30 years.  Personally, I would go for a period of 25 years.  I also believe that an anonymised project could be done.  I heard Deputy Thomas Byrne, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, say he was very worried about the potential cost of this.  Fianna F&aacute;il - Bertie Ahern and Michael Woods - did a deal with the religious orders.  How much did that cost us and how does that cost compare with the cost of looking at the records and making them anonymous but making the stories available?<\/p><p>The Minister referred to that matter and it is mentioned in summaries of the Bill.  In the early years of the previous Government there was a proposal to have a memorial to people who lived this experience and to the survivors.  That recommendation was not accepted.  Other recommendations, however, have come from all over the country suggesting there should be memorials and a museum.  People could go there to grasp the experience, just as they can go to a museum to experience what it was like living in a Dublin tenement or, indeed, being Jewish in Berlin.<\/p> <p> We need somewhere like that.  There are already a number of locations in Ireland and in Dublin.  I refer to former laundries in the centre of the city which could be utilised to tell the story of what happened to people.  I support the Bill, as do others.  On Committee Stage, however, I will move to have the period these records are sealed reduced.  I understand others will do the same.  The Minister should be guided on this by the people who are alive and who lived in these institutions.  He should also be guided by the many people who wrote about their experience in the institutions.  All the people I have met want the story told so we as a people will never be tempted to be involved in something similar again.<\/p> <p> We do of course have our own dilemmas regarding children, not least homelessness.  We are not stating this generation is fantastic.  We are struggling to get things right and we can acknowledge people then may have struggled as well.  What happened to people, however, was dreadful.  It left long shadows and deep scars.  The commission eventually began to work in a much better and more respectful way in dealing with the people who gave evidence.  Later commissions of inquiry have shown much more respect to people recounting what happened to them.<\/p> <p> I welcome this Bill and the Labour Party will support it.  We will, however, also seek to have the period the records are sealed reduced.  We will do that in a spirit of listening to the survivors and what they want.  They want the records kept and we all agree with that.  It is good that is secured.  The survivors also want a memorial to what happened and we can discuss further how that might be done properly.  In addition, they want this material made available in an appropriate and much shorter timeframe.  They do not want it made available in 75 years.  Catriona Crowe has suggested the material could be made available on an anonymised basis.  I would be perfectly happy with that.<\/p> <p> I do not think the cost can be anything close to that of the redress scheme.  I refer to the deal struck by former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the late Minister and Deputy, Dr. Michael Woods, of Fianna F&aacute;il in the dying days of one Government and the start of another.  We could move to have proper respectful remembrance and memorials similar to those commemorating dreadful events in other parts of the world.  Children and visitors could learn and hear the story of what happened.  We have since heard more stories, such as those from Tuam and the homes in Cork and Roscrea.  I refer also to what has been happening more recently with St. Patrick's Guild, which involved tens of thousands of children being adopted.  This Government, unfortunately, has still not been able to provide adopted people with access to their records.  That is another issue that needs to be addressed.  I am glad this Bill has been published.  We will support it but we would like the Minister seriously to consider changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200036#JJ00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554227700,"counter":295,"content":"<p>The preservation of the records of the three inquiries would be welcomed by everybody.

If those records are buried, that will fulfil the worst expectations people have regarding a cover-up.<\/p><p>The National Archive Act 1986 provides for officers of Government Departments, with the consent of the Department of the Taoiseach, to certify that the release of departmental records which are more than 30 years old in some circumstances:<\/p><blockquote>(a) would be contrary to the public interest, or<br \/><br \/>(b) would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty, or a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence, or<br \/><br \/>(c) would or might cause distress or danger to living persons...<\/blockquote><p>That clause already exists and it is adequate to protect any information or any person in need of protecting.  The excuse, therefore, of why we need this gagging order inserted does not hold water.  The sensitivity and interests of the people who might be damaged regarding information they gave in confidence is already protected under the legislation to which I referred.  Why, therefore, are we doing this?  What is being gagged?  We do not know the wishes of the people who gave the testimonies.  We know some are deeply distraught at even the mention of this legislation.  Can the Minister state what percentage of the people who gave evidence before the commissions wanted the records sealed for 75 years?  Were the survivors consulted about this proposal?  Were alternatives considered and given?  How many people were asked or given options about how to preserve their records?  Do they have a copy of their own testimonies?<\/p><p>We know people who gave testimony to the mother and baby homes commission have not been given a copy of their own testimony.  I do not think that is adequate or fair.  The former head of the National Archives, Catriona Crowe, has already been quoted here.  That is appropriate and not an accident.  I am going to quote her again because she is the foremost authority on archives in this State.  Archives are the public's information and part of our history.  Ms Crowe recently stated there was no clear reason why people should be denied access to copies of their own information.  Such access would be entirely in keeping with modern data requests.<\/p><p>Ms Crowe gave the example of the Military Pensions Act 1924, and related Acts, that required applicants to submit detailed information on military actions in which they were involved from 1916 to 1923.  A copy was given to the applicant in every single one of those cases.  Why are the survivors of abuse not given the same respect?  The survivors themselves have asked that question.  The files created under the Military Pensions Act dealt with serious conflicts, including the 1916 Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War.  Those conflicts involved many sensitive issues but they were not subject to a gagging clause.  There was no problem with them at all.<\/p><p>Even after the controversy around the Boston tapes, nobody mentioned imposing a 75-year rule.  In those examples nobody saw fit to have a 75-year rule, yet there is to be a different set of criteria for the victims of industrial abuse.  This is the story of those people's lives.  They have been treated differently and disrespected all of their lives and the same will apply to their records after their deaths.  It is the final insult for so many people.  <\/p> <p> Catriona Crowe raises very important questions about the legality, or lack of legality, of the proposals because the legislation will, in effect, disable parts of the National Archives Act 1986 and place records beyond the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  This is a step which will weaken citizens' rights to access vital information about themselves and which, in the era of the GDPR, is potentially illegal.  As other Deputies have said, this clause will obviously have an incredibly negative effect on public discourse and will reinforce a culture of silence and shame with regard to issues of child and sexual abuse.  It cuts across educational and cultural awareness of these issues.  In that sense, it is incredibly regressive and unbelievably disproportionate.  I cannot see any logic in it whatever.  <\/p> <p> It is ironic that this Bill is being dealt with shortly after the UN special rapporteur on child and sexual abuse made statements in which she singled out the damage that can be caused by the culture of silence.  We are perpetuating this culture in this Bill because one of our last dirty little secrets will be locked up for 75 years.<\/p> <p> Let us consider the reasons we keep archives and why they are so important.  In the first instance, we keep archives to ensure that our knowledge of the past and of human social life in all its varieties - good and bad - remains available for the future.  It is very important that records are preserved and we welcome that part of the Bill.  However, withholding them for 75 years instead of the standard period is not justified given that, as other Deputies noted, records can be anonymised and sensitive material redacted.  Furthermore, the legislation also provides a safety valve, as I mentioned.  <\/p> <p> The 30-year rule is now considered too stringent.  The United Kingdom has passed legislation to transition to a 20-year rule by 2022.  It is absolutely inevitable, with or without Brexit, that Ireland will follow suit with regard to that clause.  We have to do so in the interests of academia and scholarly access to information.  Ireland will follow and have a 20-year rule because researchers and students need to have archival access at the same time.  Otherwise, there will be an imbalance and a bias in historical research that will not be helpful for humanity across Europe.  It is inevitable that the 30-year period will change.  Despite the move towards a 20-year rule, we are adopting a 75-year rule for this special situation.  We should not engage in limiting our understanding of history or our research options.  We should be trying to manage our archival resources in a thoughtful manner on a par with our European neighbours, rather than resorting to excessive gagging legislation which will hinder future research.<\/p> <p> To hold back particular records for a much longer period than is the norm sets a very worrying precedent and arouses justifiable suspicion.  Many of the survivor groups already feel there has been an incredibly inappropriate delay in dealing with the conditions their members experienced and addressing the criminal activity that took place in the institutions.  Those conditions and that activity were ignored and covered up and these people had no recourse to the justice system for most of their lives.<\/p> <p> In the UK, an escape clause is used to block the release of archives after 30 years.  Where do these exceptions normally apply?  In Britain, they are applied to files relating to matters such as the Westland affair, the Gibraltar killings and the Falklands War.  In other words, they are applied to files relating to incredibly controversial events.  Most of us believe that these files are being gagged beyond 30 years because the British State has something to hide in respect of these matters.  That is the reason.  Does the same reason apply in this case?  Is that why we are doing this?  It looks very much like that is the case because there is no other logical explanation for this approach.  Survivors see it as a cover-up.  The only precedent relates to extremely controversial international events in respect of which the State has something to hide.  There in no other precedent.  Unless the Minister can give me a good reason not to do so, I will strenuously oppose the Bill.  This is not just important for the victims but also for history and future generations.<\/p> <p> The Cambridge historian, Richard J. Evans, who is coincidentally speaking in Trinity College this evening, was a key expert witness against the racist anti-Semite and falsifier of history, David Irving, in an historic trial in April 2000.  Irving falsified the history of the Second World War in many of his books in order to deny the Holocaust.  Evans testified against him as an expert and his expert witness testimony systemically traced the false footnotes and misleading references cited by Irving to their archival sources.  Through that process, he was able to discredit Irving's false history of the Second World War.  It was an incredibly important case and a lesson for all of us.  If those resources and archives had been gagged or buried, it would have allowed charlatans or racists like David Irving to present their warped view of history unchallenged.  Historical scholarship has to have the ability to reach reasoned conclusions on the basis of careful examination of written evidence.  That is all we are asking for.  We cannot engage in obstruction of the historical record, which is what this looks like.  We need to have the capacity to know what happened to all of these people when they are no longer around to tell us themselves.  That is absolutely vital.  To impose any special clause on that is to do them, their families and their testimonies an enormous disservice.  I am very unhappy about this.<\/p> <p> There is a certain irony in discussing this legislation in the era of fake news and the rise of the far right.  Accuracy and truth are hugely important.  Burying the truth causes major problems.  It is something that we, as a society, cannot afford to do.  As we have done here many times before, I salute the efforts of the victims and those who had the courage to speak up, speak out and come forward to testify against the perpetrators of violence and sexual abuse.  Many of those perpetrators remain unaccountable for the heinous crimes they committed.  To call for an exceptional seal on those records for 75 years creates the impression that something is being hidden.  It is a case of shame and stigma all over again and it is not helpful for healing.  Critically, it has no basis in Irish archival law.  <\/p> <p> I indicated earlier that in her report to the Human Rights Council last month, the UN special rapporteur heavily criticised Ireland for what she described as a culture of silence around issues of childhood sexual abuse and exploitation.  She had not even seen this legislation.  Wait until she does because she will add to her report.  She also highlighted the reason she singled this issue out as a cause for concern.  She said that historical precedents impact on the situation today.  That is absolutely the case.  If we do not learn lessons from the past, we cannot move forward into the future.  We know the State's response to the legacy of sexual abuse, incarceration, forced adoption and mother and baby homes has been a disappointment to the survivors.  Instead of support, redress, and access to justice, the State has engaged in denial, delay, gagging survivors and limiting the scope of investigations.  It has left people behind in respect of Bethany Home and the Magdalen laundries and has given indemnity to many perpetrators, including St. Patrick's Guild and the like.  It has let religious orders off the hook for the financial bill and traumatised many of the victims all over again through the establishment and mismanagement of Caranua.  This is part of that process.<\/p> <p> It did not have to be this way.  That is what really sickens me.  Other countries in which similar abuses took place, including Canada, the UK and Australia, did not deal with the issue in the way in which we are dealing with it - or not dealing with it as the case may be.  They moved faster and were more compassionate.  They issued apologies and dealt with redress.  They accepted the state's role in the abuses, held their hands up and allowed people to move on.  In this country, the permanent government has decided to dig in, protect the State at all costs and, I suspect, protect some of the religious orders as well.  This Bill is another part of that process.<\/p><p>The sealing of records has already taken place in terms of, for example, adoption records.  It helps no one and causes a lifetime of grief.  We cannot have that.<br\/><br\/>The Government is being disingenuous about the sensitivity of the files.  I do not mean the Minister personally, but that is the only conclusion I can draw from the legislation before us and the fact that the State has never acted in the interests of survivors of abuse or their families.  We have seen that time and again in the form of the Magdalen redress scheme, Caranua, Bethany Home, illegal adoptions and so on.  The State's approach in the first instance is to protect itself, not the survivors.  That is the hallmark of every option it takes.  It should be the victims who make the call to draw a line under something, not the State.<br\/><br\/>Catriona Crowe has done a great deal to highlight some of the institutional abuses that took place.  Her curiosity was raised when she found files that originated in another jurisdiction.  That led to her taking a closer look and discovering 1,500 documents relating to the illegal adoption of children to the United States.  Apart from the heartbreak of the families involved, the startling aspect of her uncovering of those historical records was the fact that the State, through officials in the then Department of External Affairs, had facilitated the illegal export of children.  It is no wonder that people are suspicious of the Government's intentions in sealing records, but the truth will out no matter how great the attempt to bury it, which is what this Bill is doing.<br\/><br\/>I will quote Catriona Crowe's remarks on this legislation in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>last week:<\/p><blockquote>The existing provisions of the National Archives Act are more than adequate to cover access to these records ...<br \/><br \/>These records are vital for an understanding of the policies and operations of the commission, and there is no reason at all why they should be closed for 75 years.<br \/><br \/>We should all remember that survivors should be the primary consideration with regard to these records.<br \/><br \/>They were brave enough to give testimonies about their shocking treatment to the commission, and the emphasis now should be on establishing what they want, and as far as practicably possible, meeting their wishes.<\/blockquote><p>I have not met a survivor of these institutions who wants this legislation.  Survivors want the truth to come out, justice, a full acknowledgement, an apology and redress.  They do not want a continuation of the culture of silence that led to them being incarcerated in these institutions for so long and to so many people not being called to account for what happened.  I hope that we will see sense and, while preserving these documents, ensure that they are subject to the normal protections that exist as opposed to this special gagging clause.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200037#KK00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554228900,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I appreciate their tone as well.  We are all very aware of the sensitivity around this matter.  I am also conscious of the legal responsibilities.  I have listened to individual contributions tonight, as I want to get this right for the people who have suffered and endured lives that, in many cases, are difficult to imagine.  Collectively, the House has that responsibility and duty.<\/p>  <p>  I will reiterate the competing imperatives in this legislation.  There is a legal onus, a legal interpretation and issues of confidentiality.  Many of the witnesses' contributions were given in confidence.  This is one of the competing imperatives for me.  The records contain findings of fault against individuals.  Due to the assurances of confidentiality, those allegations were not tested in the way they would have been in a court of law.  This is why there are serious concerns about the right to privacy, the right to a good name and legitimate expectations of confidentiality.  As a result, the legal advice is that early release of the records could be open to legal challenge from survivors and alleged perpetrators of abuse.  That is one argument.  Other arguments have been put relating to, for example, the period of time being too long, but there are competing parts.  For example, people have given information and testimony.  There are parents who have not informed their children about what happened but who, due to the structure of confidentiality, were comfortable and prepared to give this information.  I am very conscious of that aspect.  The lengthy period is to minimise the possibility of traumatising individuals who might be traumatised by the release of their records, for example, parents who never told their children about their experiences and people who had to go into detail about the abuse they suffered.<\/p>  <p>  I re-emphasise the importance of the Ryan report and memorialisation, matters that were raised by a number of Deputies.  The report is a very revealing history of institutional abuse and contains many stories of abuse - not just sexual abuse, but abuse in its many forms.  We must ensure that there is a continued awareness of the report, its contents and its findings.  I am anxious to consider further how best to achieve the memorialisation of the entire institutional experience.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding anonymisation, these records are fundamentally personal ones and, as such, the removal of all personal information would rob them of their true meaning.  The possibility of error is real and the accidental release of information could cause real trauma again.<\/p>  <p>  Issues with the consultation were raised.  Copies of the Bill were sent to groups.  At all times, officials and I were available to engage.  Officials are happy to meet survivors of abuse at any time, even between now and Committee Stage.  I take on board Deputy O'Reilly's comments about achieving consensus.  We have to try to work hard on achieving consensus.  These people have had to endure such suffering down the years and I do not want to add to that trauma through the words that we use in this House.  I am conscious of my own words.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has been flagged for a number of years.  There was pre-legislative scrutiny of it in 2015.  Survivors provided their comments to the committee.  It was a mixed response.<\/p>  <p>  In many respects, Ireland is further advanced in terms of investigating child abuse and related redress schemes.  Therefore, there is limited international experience on which to draw.  Deputy Clare Daly stated that the period was \"unprecedented\".  She referred to Australia.  Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse recently completed its work.  It appears that its records will in due course be transferred into the custody of the National Archives of Australia and will not be open for access for 99 years.  Regarding the Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, a restriction order was made prohibiting access to the inquiry's records for a period of 100 years, with some limited exceptions.  I sat down with my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  She had difficulty with the period of 75 years as a continuum.  As such, she suggested a review after 25 years.  I will be happy on Committee Stage to build that review period into the legislation.  Whoever is in government in 25 years' time will have a decision to make.<\/p><p>The Government of the day may decide to look at this in a different way.  That review at 25 years is being built in as a response to the 75 years in the legislation and it does exactly what it says on the tin.  It not only feels like a long time, it is a long time and does give the appearance - the optics - that there is something to hide here.  There is nothing to hide.  We, as a country, over the past 15 or 20 years have started to open our dark past and we must continue to talk about and articulate that.  We must ensure the next generation knows about our dark past.<\/p> <p> It is regrettable that child abuse may occur in a variety of situations and, notwithstanding the demise of the industrial schools and reformatories, it is vital that we have a strong and robust child protection system in place.  Deputy Burton made the point that we cannot sit back on our laurels and think it is okay today, it was bad in the past and it will be okay tomorrow.  That is not the case.  There are 3,700 children in emergency accommodation.  We still grapple with these issues today in a way that leaders grappled with issues in the past through their different constraints.<\/p> <p> The child protection guidelines which were first introduced in 1991-92 have been progressively strengthened, specifically in relation to child protection arrangements in schools.  The Department of Education and Skills issued guidelines to schools in three phases - 1991-92, 2001-04 and again in 2011.  The Department's procedures for responding to child protection concerns that are brought to the attention of staff employed by the Department were updated in February 2016, having been first issued in 1995 and revised in 2007.  Garda vetting is now on a statutory basis with the commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 and the application for the new vetting procedures in the educational sector has been expressly provided for in the Teaching Council Acts.  The Children First Act 2015 was signed into law on 19 November 2015.  All remaining provisions of the Children First Act commenced on 11 December 2017.<\/p> <p> As part of my Department's ongoing work to improve child protection measures across the education sector, the inspectorate introduced child protection and safeguarding inspections in February 2019 as a new form of specialised child protection inspection.  The child protection and safeguarding inspections enable the inspectorate to promote best practice in the implementation of child protection arrangements in schools, monitor the implementation of the child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools 2017 in a sample of primary and post-primary schools annually and publish written reports on the implementation of child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools 2017 in the sample of schools inspected.<\/p> <p> The story of our residential institutions and the abuse which took place within them is a vitally important part of the history of our nation.  This story has been captured in the Ryan report which will stand as a testament to that abuse and the suffering that children endured.  I re-emphasise that Mr. Justice Sean Ryan did not call for the records to be released.  It is critical that as much of that history as possible is preserved intact.  In line with the spirit of the previous motion of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, this requires that the records of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board and its confidential committee be retained and not destroyed, as originally envisaged.  At the same time, it is incumbent on us to have due regard to the highly sensitive and personal nature of these records and the consequent risks and impacts which would be incurred and felt if they were released in the short term.  As I have said, the Retention of Records Bill strikes a carefully considered balance between these competing imperatives and I commend it to the House.<\/p> <p> The House must get this right.  It does a further injustice if it does not.  If there is something that I or the officials are missing, we are open to it.  Deputy Thomas Byrne set the tone tonight by saying that if there are things we can do here to do justice to the people who were served a grave injustice, we must be big, brave and open enough to do that.  I am willing to do work that needs to be done between now and Committee Stage if there is something we can do.  However, the competing parts here are very difficult.  The built-in 25-year review takes away from the length of the 75 years and the optics that something might be hidden here.  Nothing is being hidden.  We need to fully embrace our past.  People on all sides of this House, for example, are talking about reviewing history: this is part of our history and it is why it is so important to have this information and topic on the desks of our students for the next generation because I will not allow this to be swept under the carpet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200039#MM00200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1554229500,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Retention of Records Bill 2019: Referral to Select Committee","time":1554229500,"counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200040#NN00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1554229500,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><p>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Education and Skills pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200040#NN00400","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1554229500,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2019: Message from Select Committee","time":1554229500,"counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200040#NN00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1554229500,"counter":305,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimate for public services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2019: Vote 29.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200040#NN00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1554229500,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 7.07 p.m. and resumed at 8 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Autism Support Services: Motion [Private Members]","time":1554230100,"counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200041#TT00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1554230100,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:acknowledges that:<blockquote>&mdash;

Should the motion pass, the next critical and urgent step is to work together to establish the committee.<\/p><p>As our party spokesperson for education there are a few key points I would like to make in my contribution.  The equal right to education for all children is not being upheld at present by the State and the Government.  We know that under the Education Act 1998 schools are under statutory obligation to provide education to students appropriate to their abilities and needs.  The failure to make diagnoses in adequate time for school applications and the lack of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and available places for autistic children is a denial of a child's right to education.  These factors create a two-tier system in our education system.<\/p><p>I am positive that all Deputies will have encountered parents concerned about the wait for diagnosis for their child, or that their child has yet to receive a place in primary or secondary school or, indeed, that their child has been asked to leave a school as a result of the child's needs not having been met.  We need a review of the method by which the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, process the establishment of autism spectrum disorder classes in schools and how these classes are staffed.  We need to get to the bottom of why so many autistic children are not in school.  We need to find solutions to the barriers facing autistic children gaining places in schools and address the fundamental issues as to why schools are reluctant to open autism spectrum disorder classes.  Until we are honest and open about all of these influencing factors and take action these problems will simply compound year on year.<\/p><p>Our schools must be resourced adequately to provide equally for all children who attend, with or without additional needs.  All schools need to acknowledge that diagnostic rates are increasing among our population and we must deliver for that changing demographic.  Teachers must be supported through this process.  Schools cannot simply state they will not open an autism spectrum disorder class without justification when there is clear evidence of need.  If a parent feels his or her child needs additional supports, and that child has been diagnosed to verify this, that parent must be heard.<\/p><p>We also need to address the issue of social stigma.  We must be cognisant that the potential to institutionalise, intentionally or not, remains a reality and this must be acknowledged in our schools.  A child with additional needs is as entitled to an education and equal opportunities as any other child, to become a fully participating citizen with access to education and employment should he or she wish.  Families and parents must be supported in their efforts to achieve this.  Of course, there are many varying points on the autism spectrum and a situation that may be accepted by one child without problems might be found completely overwhelming or challenging by another.  This is why individual education plans are crucial to a child's development and progress in a school.<\/p><p>In the motion we call for consultation with disability groups and educational stakeholders on the full implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004, which would be undertaken at the earliest opportunity.  Second level students with additional needs throughout the State are being denied access to particular subjects on a teacher's evaluation of his or her readiness for that subject.  Parents have told me this happens regularly and they are denied input.  School boards of management need to step up to the plate and request the relevant supports from the Department of Education and Skills, and the NCSE where needed, so teachers feel supported in this situation.  It is pointless to advocate policies on inclusiveness unless these policies are implemented and monitored in a standardised and consistent way.<\/p><p>We have come a long way from the dark days of the immediate institutionalisation of anyone deemed different, or any woman or child who did not fit in the accepted social norms.  If we are to learn anything from that dark part of our past it should be that all of our citizens should be cherished equally.  This right must begin at birth and carry throughout every child's journey in our education system.  If our shared hope is that we grow as a compassionate and tolerant society we must practice what we preach and work to ensure every child has a place in a school in his or her local community.  This is not an issue for parents to fight alone.  It is the responsibility of all of us.  If we have failed even one child then we have failed, and I urge all Deputies to vote in favour of the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200041#TT00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1554230100,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I commend the motion to the House.  I ask that all parties and Independents support the asks contained within it, which have the capacity to transform the lives of the autistic community in Ireland.  It is heartening to see the Visitors Gallery so busy, with visitors from the autism community, advocacy groups and families in attendance.  They are very welcome.  C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of services and supports to persons with autism is not fit for purpose.  The autism community in Ireland is way ahead of where the thinking of many politicians is at in demanding their rights to inclusion and requesting acceptance of the condition.  We must all recognise that autistic people have unique skills and intellect that need to be embraced and allowed develop to their full potential and not marginalised as, all too sadly, has been the case for many years.<\/p>  <p>  The motion is different from others that have preceded it, in that it is the first real attempt at looking at a future for the autistic community in Ireland from a more social approach rather than being medically or clinically led, as so often has been the case.  Since last June, we have reached out to the Irish Society for Autism, South East Autism Action, DCA Warriors, Autism Assistance Dogs Ireland and AsIAm.  They are all represented here this evening and I thank them for their input and suggestions in putting the motion together.  We also studied international strategies in Canada, Scotland and Malta when framing the approach.  Last August, I organised a Sinn F&eacute;in delegation from North and South to visit the Middletown Centre for Autism in County Armagh.  I acknowledge the fantastic work they have done since being established in 2007.  I again record my thanks to all involved for their time and welcome.<\/p>  <p>  All of these contributions and meetings have contributed to the initiative before the House but the hard work starts tomorrow.  We have had motions passed previously, particularly in the area disability.  Unfortunately, while the Government supported the passing of those motions, the asks contained in them remain undelivered.  This cannot be the case in this instance.  Two attempts I know of have been made to legislate for an autism Bill in the past.  Both attempts failed and both of the Bills were criticised for being too medically focused.  I understand there is support for the motion before us from the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il.  This support is very welcome but it must not, as I have said, end here.  We ask for the establishment of an all-party committee to be set up and strictly mandated to develop an autism empowerment strategy within a six-month period.<\/p><p>Today Sinn F&eacute;in wrote to the Ceann Comhairle seeking his support for that endeavour and asking him to work to make it happen as early as possible.<\/p> <p> I again refer to the representatives in the Visitors Gallery.  They are the experts.  They need to be part of this process as it develops.  I hope that all of the groups they represent will be invited to present to the committee once it is established.<\/p> <p> I cannot finish without referring to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Sinn F&eacute;in remains utterly frustrated by the slow rate of progress of the implementation of the rights contained within it.  Similarly, we believe the optional protocol should be ratified without delay.  The argument that all legislation must be brought up to speed before it is ratified does not stand up.  In the past two weeks, I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, regarding the holding of Report and Final Stages of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and in response I received only a bare acknowledgement.<\/p> <p> I wish to again commend the autism community in Ireland.  On World Autism Awareness Day 2019, they deserve the absolute commitment of all parties present to deliver on this motion.  They have been waiting and marginalised for far too long.

It is appropriate for it to be discussed in the House on World Autism Awareness Day.  It raises an issue that has come to the fore in recent years.  The reality is that we are behind the curve in Europe on this issue.  Many states have an autism strategy in place.  Such a strategy is needed in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  A study by the NCSE estimates that one in every 65 students has a diagnosis of autism.  This condition affects a very large number of children.  Although I accept that there has been an increase in autism spectrum condition, ASC, places and supports, it is simply nowhere near the level required.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, I have been contacted by dozens of parents who are upset and worried that their child who has autism cannot get a place in the local school.  Children are waiting very long periods to be assessed and in the meantime are not getting the supports and access to therapies that they need.  There are many young and growing communities in Dublin Bay North and finding a place in a local school is tough at the best of times.  However, finding a place in a local school for a child with autism is next to impossible in some areas.  That is wrong and unfair.  It is a failure by the State to meet the needs of its citizens that we cannot ensure that children with autism get the supports they need in their local school.  The State has an obligation to ensure that every child meets his or her full potential.  To do that, appropriate supports must be in place.  No child should be left behind simply because he or she has additional needs.  I commend the motion.  I hope to see the establishment of an all-party committee which will finally deliver an autism empowerment strategy for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200042#UU00200","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1554230700,"counter":312,"content":"<p>In the constituency of Dublin Mid-West which I represent, a high number of children and young people with autism and other special needs are on particularly lengthy waiting lists for support services.  There are some fantastic services in the area such as Rosse Court in Lucan and schools such as St. Peter the Apostle junior and senior schools in north Clondalkin that provide world-class supports for children and families.  Unfortunately, too often such services are not adequately supported by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  It can take up to 18 months for a child to get a diagnosis from the local CAMHS service.  When the child gets a diagnosis, he or she may have to wait a significant period before being able to access services.  The most recent updated figures provided to me by the Minister for my local HSE community healthcare organisation area indicate that more than 50 children were waiting for a place on the early bird programme, 173 for psychological support, 203 for speech and language therapy and 231 for occupational therapy.  However, the real scandal is the length of time for which they must wait.  Children were waiting 18 months or more for the early bird programme and psychological support, 23 months for speech and language therapy and 24 months or more for occupational therapy.  That is three or four years of a young child's life during which his or her development is actively being held back by the failure of the Government to invest in adequate services.  Indeed, when I asked a mother from my constituency who has two young boys on the autism spectrum what was the single worst thing about her experience of the system, she did not refer to the length of time she had to wait for a diagnosis.  Rather, she stated it was when, on the day she got the diagnosis for her first child, she was given a 50-page information booklet and sent on her way.  She said it was the most difficult moment of her life and that the one thing she would seek today, in addition to increasing resources for support services, would be that parents be given greater support at the time of diagnosis to enable them to navigate their way through that very difficult, traumatic and, at times, bureaucratic system.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the comments of other Members on schools and school placements, particularly senior school placements in Dublin, and on social welfare anomalies such as the taxing of carer's allowance - unlike domiciliary allowance - which places an unnecessary burden on parents.  <\/p>  <p>  I very much hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who is present, is listening to what Members say on this issue.

Bringing up a child with autism can be challenging for parents, particularly when other people do not understand the issues involved.  Parents often find it more difficult to get their child access to educational and other services because of perceived issues related to the child&rsquo;s condition.  Unfortunately, this can lead to further social isolation and frustration for the child and heartbreak for the parents.<\/p>  <p>  On many occasions, Sinn F&eacute;in has, through its spokespersons on education, disability and health, raised the issue of the serious lack of special school places and autism spectrum condition units throughout the country.  I can attest that that lack of services is very evident in Dublin North-West.  It is particularly acute at primary and secondary school level.  My constituency office is currently dealing with several such cases.<\/p>  <p>  The parents of a child with autism whose case I am currently dealing with are in the Visitors Gallery.  Such parents are a credit and an example to us all.  The problems they face in accessing proper services for their son, Se&aacute;n, seem insurmountable.   Se&aacute;n has a dual diagnosis of Down's syndrome and autism spectrum condition.  His parents continue to fight for him because, as his mother stated, he is being deprived of an appropriate school placement that can provide him with the necessary supports that will result in him performing to the best of his ability.  She states that there is a severe lack of appropriate places for children like her son in the north Dublin area.  He currently attends a mainstream school but has had a difficult time because the school was not following recommended strategies or was not able to provide him with the supports he requires.  This has proven very stressful and frustrating for Se&aacute;n and his family, and Se&aacute;n has become increasingly introverted.  His parents are finding it very difficult to secure an appropriate school placement for him within their catchment area, while he is placed bottom of the list for places outside their catchment area.  As a result of the lack of resources and services for those with autism, Se&aacute;n is effectively being deprived of an appropriate school placement and a placement in an ASC unit.  Such appropriate placement in or school or an ASC unit would provide Se&aacute;n with the necessary supports to allow to perform to the best of his ability.  It is what a parent would want for his or her child.

I agree with many of their points and acknowledge the work they have done on disability over the years.  I thank the Deputies for tabling this motion during world autism month and on this day, the 12th World Autism Awareness Day.  I welcome the opportunity to restate this Government's commitment to supporting people with autism and their families.  Like my colleagues, I welcome all the advocates, parents and families in the Visitors Gallery.  The more who attend, the more the motion is strengthened and the greater the political will to develop autism services.<\/p>  <p>  Autism spectrum disorders are a group of life-long neurodevelopmental conditions that are estimated to affect between 1% and 1.5% of the population.  Autism is a complex condition and sometimes results in physical, sensory and social difficulties that can cause distress for individuals and their families.  When properly supported and understood, however, individuals with autism can thrive, flourish and maximise their full potential.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching principle governing the planning and delivery of services and supports for adults and children with disabilities, including autism, is that they should be integrated as much as possible with services and supports for the rest of the population.  The Government's agenda in this regard is set out in the current national disability inclusion strategy, which I launched in July 2017.  The strategy takes a whole-of-Government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities and aims to create the best possible opportunities for people with disabilities to fulfil their potential.  It reaffirms established Government policy that public services should include and serve people with disabilities.  This is underpinned by the Disability Act 2005.  A wide range of Departments are included in the strategy and its remit encompasses both mainstream and dedicated disability services.  The strategy, which sets out Government policy on disability until 2021, takes a non-condition-specific approach to the delivery of public services and emphasises the importance of cross-departmental working and stakeholder consultation.  The strategy included the development of a specific programme of additional actions in regard to autism, designed in conjunction with the National Disability Authority, NDA.  In line with the Government's mainstreaming agenda, the Department of Justice and Equality has responsibility for providing a focal point for the promotion and co-ordination of disability policy, including autism.<\/p>  <p>  The programme of actions on autism recognises that a greater understanding of autism across the public sector is required to address the needs of those with autism on the same basis as others with disabilities.  This increased awareness has informed the Government's approach to policy development and service reviews, ensuring that detailed consultation with service users and representative bodies is the norm.<\/p>  <p>  This approach, with a keen emphasis on consultation, was adopted in 2015, when the NCSE brought forward policy advice that specifically examined issues relating to the education of children with autism.  The council consulted a wide range of stakeholders, including parents and children with autism.  The council reported that consultation groups acknowledged that generally the education supports in place are the correct supports and work well for students with autism.  Its policy advice sets out a range of recommendations which are currently being developed within the Department of Education and Skills.  Alongside this consultative approach, there has been a significant increase in cross-departmental and interagency working.  This has resulted in improved services for people with autism.  Deputies may be familiar with the quotation, \"Autism doesn't come with a manual; it comes with a parent who never gives up.\"  I recognise that, all too often, the efforts of parents have had to be directed towards the providers of services that have not been meeting the needs of their children.  This has begun to change but further work is needed.  I totally accept that fact.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased the Department of Education and Skills has moved towards providing educational supports to children based on the needs of the pupils rather than on a particular diagnosis of disability.  This recognises that there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every category of special educational need, whereas an allocation model strictly based upon diagnosis does not capture these distinctions.  To date, this approach is working well and is consistent with international approaches.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8 billion being spent annually, which is about &euro;1 in every &euro;5 of the education budget.  This includes an allocation of over &euro;300 million towards providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools.  The greater proportion of children with autism attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required.  Special class placements are provided in mainstream schools for students with autism and more complex needs where it has been demonstrated they are unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day, even with appropriate supports.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2011, the number of special classes has increased from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which almost 1,200 are ASD special classes.  Special school placements are provided for other students with autism where their needs are more complex.  I note the Deputies' concerns regarding wider commencement of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  While a number of sections of the Act have been commenced, including those establishing the NCSE and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs, there are a number of sections which have not, which I accept.<\/p>  <p>  Under A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government has committed to consulting stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.  Consultations have taken place on a range of policy reforms, including the new model for allocating special education teachers.  Significant progress has also been made in orienting our health and social care services in a direction that is more appropriate for users with autism.  Deputies will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Health, has requested that the HSE carry out a review of health services for people with autism and identify examples of good practise that can be replicated more widely in the health service.  Again, there was strong emphasis on consultation with stakeholders and service users.  Following the publication of this review, the Minister for Health requested that the HSE establish a programme board to implement the recommendations of the review and publish an autism plan this year.  This commitment is reflected in the HSE national service plan for 2019.  An initial meeting of the programme board has now taken place and work is under way to ensure people with lived experience of autism are represented on it.  That is a major step in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  Several actions by the HSE are planned or under way.  These include the development of guidance for clinical practitioners working in the field of autism, standardising the autism assessment process and the planning of a communications public awareness campaign.  Standardising the assessment process, in particular, will be an important step in improving access to services for people with autism.<\/p>  <p>  Under the programme for progressing disability services for children and young people, children's disability network teams are being reconfigured so that all children with a disability, including autism, and their families will have access to services according to their needs.  The HSE's national service plan recognises the need for further investment in additional therapies and assessment for children and funding for a further 100 new therapy posts is being provided over the course of 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to rolling out a national access policy that will provide for a clear pathway in terms of access to primary and specialist network teams for children, young people and adults with autism.<\/p><p>The HSE is committed to rolling out a national access policy, which will provide for a clear pathway of access to primary and specialist network teams for children, young people and adults with autism.  Additionally, the HSE and Tusla have been rolling out a joint arrangements protocol for the co-ordination of services for children and young people with disabilities.  Many children and adults with autism spectrum disorders who have support needs can be effectively supported within mainstream child and adult health services.  Most children with developmental delay will access therapy services via primary care.  The Government is committed to the expansion of primary care.  This is reflected in the roll-out of primary care centres across the country.  There are 127 operational centres, with further centres scheduled to open this year.  In addition, another 80 sites are at various stages of development.  Our intention is to drive forward the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda, as set out in the national disability inclusion strategy.  The Government will not oppose this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200043#VV00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554231900,"counter":318,"content":"<p>What about the bit before that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200044#WW00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1554231900,"counter":319,"content":"<p>The Minister of State did not read it all out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200044#WW00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1554231900,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I did not get to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200044#WW00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1554231900,"counter":321,"content":"<p>The Minister of State skipped over it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200044#WW00500","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1554231900,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for introducing this motion.  I do not often agree with Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, but I am fully behind them on this occasion.  I welcome the people in the Gallery.  I would like to extend a special welcome to Patricia O'Leary, who has travelled all the way from Ballinascarty to be here this evening.  I would like to publicly acknowledge the Trojan work she does in the field of autism.  I would also like to acknowledge the presence of the Dublin 12 campaign group which works very closely with my colleague, Senator Ardagh.  Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to support this motion on World Autism Awareness Day.  More importantly, we support the values that underpin the motion.  The complexities of an autism diagnosis should not preclude any person from the right to a fulfilling life.  In that regard, the introduction of an autism empowerment strategy can provide for achievable, effective and sustainable intervention programmes.  The motion before the House proposes the establishment of an all-party committee on autism, which would \"hear directly from autistic people and their families\" to gain practical and actionable insights into their thoughts and aspirations.  This is very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, I had the pleasure of opening the Re-Thinking Autism conference in Cork.  The attendees were a diverse group of adults with autism, parents, families, caregivers, employers, educators, professionals and advocates.  I believe this mix is important because far too often, policymakers tend to discuss autism with just some of the stakeholders.  We often neglect to include everyone.  That said, it is necessary to point out that progress cannot be made with a strategy unless the HSE service plans that have been promised are put in place.  We all know that early intervention is vital.  In that regard, it is imperative that the full capacity of children's disability network teams is put in place without delay.  Fewer than half of the 129 teams are in place at this stage.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions.  I was told the new teams would be in place by the end of 2018.  Clearly, this has not come to pass.  Not enough children's disability network teams are in place.  Moreover, the amount of time that a child must wait to receive a first assessment for occupational therapy is truly shocking.  Over 6,500 people under the age of 18 have been waiting more than a year for such an assessment.  The number of occupational therapists employed in the HSE disability services remains below the level required to ensure services are not understaffed.  Aside from anything else, the right to an assessment is set out in law.  The Disability Act 2005 provides that an assessment must commence within three months of an application and must be completed within a further three months.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill mentioned in the motion, which Fianna F&aacute;il supported during its passage through the Seanad, will not make a difference unless the Government lives up to its responsibilities.  Thankfully, there is a growing realisation in Irish society that we need to find ways of accommodating people with autism, particularly children.  It is great to see shops, cinemas and football stadiums offering places where people with autism can rightly take part in everyday activities.  I am particularly proud of Clonakilty, which is in my constituency of Cork South-West, because it has been designated as Ireland's first autism-friendly town.  Corcaigh Thiar Theas is leading the way again.  In order to attain this honour, which was awarded to Clonakilty by the AsIAm organisation, the town had to comply with a rigorous process.  Participants in this initiative include businesses, volunteers, schools, public services and healthcare professionals.  Organisations that are signed up to this initiative are known as autism-friendly champions and are recognisable by a sticker displayed on the front door of their premises.  Each of them also displays a \"service dog friendly\" sticker.  This shining example of how to make our communities more inclusive can be replicated throughout the country.  In that regard, funding needs to be in place so that supports can be readily available.  I hope the Government will take some meaningful and concrete steps to make progress with the concepts outlined in this motion.  I call on the Minister of State to accept the motion.  I am glad he has indicated he will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200044#WW00600","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1554231900,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I am grateful to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony for giving me a minute and to Deputy Donnelly for allowing me in.

Until and unless one lives with it and sees it happening in one's own family, one does not really realise it.  No matter what one reads in motions or elsewhere, one has to see it happening in front of one's own two eyes.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to make four brief points.  First, in some parts of this country, services for adults with autism are almost non-existent.  Second, in many parts of the country, very limited summer provision is offered to primary or secondary school students when they come out of school for the summer.  Third, we should encourage school boards to have among their members the parents of autistic children.  Fourth, there is a serious lack of support for autistic people when they leave school.<\/p>  <p>  There are many things we must change.  I fully commend this motion.  Like many people, I got a message on Facebook yesterday morning from a mother who runs the My Boy Blue page.  It is shocking and disgraceful that she has had to go to court to fight for her son's educational rights.  It should not be happening.  We should think of her family and all the other families that have been placed in this position.  I commend the motion and I support it.  I am glad that Deputies on this side of the House will support it.  There should be no vote on this motion.  It should be unanimously agreed by everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200044#WW00700","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1554231900,"counter":324,"content":"<p>As Deputy Murphy O'Mahony has said, Fianna F&aacute;il will support this excellent motion.

Senator Reilly explained that legislation relating to a national autism strategy, which was passed by the Seanad, \"now lies dormant\".  I remind the House that in the words of Senator Reilly, \"the early interventions that [children] should be having, which they are not having, will impact on them much later in life\".  Tonight we have an opportunity to begin to right that wrong by making sure this country has sufficient numbers of doctors, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and the many other professional support people who are needed.  Tonight we have a chance to make sure there are enough special needs assistants and that places in ASD units do not suddenly disappear when a child goes from primary school to secondary school.

She has a wonderful son, Liam, who has autism.  He has been an inspiration for her and many other parents who, together, have established and developed the Cavan Autism Parents Support Group, CAPS.  Since Bernie founded CAPS, she has noticed a remarkable increase in the number of families attending the support group.  It has gone from 20 to 67 families and includes 77 amazing children.  The group is organised by parents, carers and volunteers who, together, run activities such as sibling workshops, Easter and summer camps, Saturday clubs, day trips and many more activities for families.<\/p><p>Parents are frustrated.  To be fair, they are not asking for much when one sees how much they achieve for themselves.  As they know only too well, every day is a struggle.  Bernie Nelson described how the State had supported her in her quest to provide services:<\/p><blockquote>If I had the Minister in front of me, what would I say?  I would tell them to come with me, for a day.  I would walk them side by side through all the work we do, so they could see the good it has for both the children and their families.  I would want the Minister to see what it takes each day to work with these children, getting them onto the bus, and then I would want them to come back to me and try say &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t deserve better funding&rdquo;.<br \/><br \/>I am fed up.

Children with autism need to have the same chance as every other child.<\/p>  <p>  The Cork-Kerry region accounted for 40% of the country&rsquo;s overall waiting list disability assessment waiting times.  Within that figure, a significant cohort are waiting for ASD assessments just to start the process.  While there is a three-month statutory limit, very few, if any, will realistically achieve it, with 80% of cases held back.  That, in turn, wipes out any chance of an early intervention.  After that, it is all about catch-up.<\/p>  <p>  Services are overwhelmed, but that pales into insignificance when one looks at the overwhelming challenge with which parents are faced in having to fight the system, as well as dealing with their children's needs.

The situation in counties Cork and Kerry, as described, is a national scandal.  In my area children are waiting between two and three years for an autism assessment.  At the end of it, if they receive a diagnosis, there is still no holy grail.  There simply are no services available.  Once a child is put on the autism waiting list for an assessment, the HSE completely washes its hands of him or her.  There is no longer any early intervention and he or she no longer receives any speech and language therapy or occupational therapy.  He or she is on the waiting list of the service provider and the HSE is shot of him or her.  That is the reality in counties Cork and Kerry.  It is a scandal.<\/p>  <p>  We have made progress in providing ASD units, but we do not have enough special schools.  Home tuition is no substitute because there is no social interaction and it is a huge imposition on the entire family in question.  Later in life, there are no residential places available.  I have raised this as a Topical Issue matter before.  It is a scandal, with a never-ending waiting list for residential places.  Elderly parents are caring for adult children with profound disabilities, including autism and they do not know what will happen when they pass on because there is no likelihood of obtaining a residential place for them.  We are failing them and it is not good enough.  All any parent of a child with autism wants is that his or her child can be the best he or she possibly can be.  We are not delivering in that regard.

In the past ten days I have had two families from two schools in my constituency inform me that their children have been sent home at noon each day, three hours earlier than the rest of the school population, simply because the schools cannot cope.

Providing notification of funding for community health organisations, CHOs, and students in May is much too late.  It does not give them enough time to contact their service providers to have the proper services in place before September.  I recommend notifying all parties involved 12 months in advance to ensure they will be able to provide the proper care services to ensure a smooth transition to adult services.  The timelines, as well as the numbers receiving timely adult care, must be improved on.  In addition, I want to bring to the Minister of State's attention three specific cases which I have asked him to examine previously.  The first is that of Lisa Pollman-Daamen who is receiving part-time care in Camphill Community Dingle and seeking full-time care.  Lisa's parents met the Minister of State a few weeks ago and had a positive meeting with him.  Despite this, the HSE is still claiming it does not have funds available to provide full-time care.

As we know, without such an assessment, children with autism cannot access basic services such as speech and language therapy or obtain extra support in schools such as special needs assistants.  Approximately 600 children are born with autism annually.  Behind statistics are real-life stories of families who find it very difficult to cope and who are incredibly frustrated.  Evelyn, mum to four and a half year old Charlie, told me of her sense of disbelief, anger, frustration and complete and utter desperation.

She has done sterling work in this area.  It is appropriate that we discuss this issue on World Autism Awareness Day.  Awareness is crucial to understanding.  In the past, autistic adults were institutionalised, marginalised and, at worst, hospitalised in this country.  Thankfully, society's approach towards people with autism has improved and there is more inclusion and understanding.  It has been autistic people themselves and their families who have changed misconceptions about autism.  Their life experience and testimony has given us a better understanding of autism.<\/p>  <p>  There are still enormous barriers in society for autistic people in employment, education and support needs.  Autistic people can live perfectly productive lives.  Many of the barriers which autistic people face come from how society responds to them, which is quite inadequate.  Early intervention is crucial to children and the current delays in diagnosis can have an enormous impact on a child's development.  Many children find themselves in very long queues for crucial supports.  Families are forced to seek private services or else face waiting years for early intervention.  The Disability Act 2005, which provides that children be assessed within three months, is failing so badly that families are bringing the Government to the High Court for breaking its own legislation.  It is extraordinary that parents must drag the Government through the courts to secure early intervention.  It is incredible.<\/p>  <p>  We can have very good speeches in this House and the Government can say that it is doing its best, but the figures speak for themselves, as others have noted.  They are damning of this Government and its predecessors.  In 2008, 1,143 applications for an assessment of needs evaluation were not completed within the statutory three-month period.  By 2017, the figure had risen to 2,154, and by October 2018, 3,662 were overdue.  Potentially thousands of families could bring the Government to court because it is breaking its own laws.  It is an extraordinary position in which the Government has placed itself.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude on a positive note.  Today, one of the most inspiring activists of our time wrote on Twitter that she was \"proud to be on the spectrum\".  Most people will know this young Swedish school student, Greta Thunberg, who has been campaigning for climate justice.

It should not be necessary that we would have visitors in the Gallery to pressurise the Government to do what is right.  I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies for giving me the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I come from a city and a county where services for people with autism are practically non-existent.  I became aware of a review, which I will return to shortly, in December 2018 when the Galway Autism Partnership, which provides a service to 200 families, appealed to all local Deputies to do something because it was about to close.  It relies on voluntary workers, almost 200 of them, and provides an enormous range of supports.  Its unit, which is based in Athenry and serves Roscommon and Galway, had no service at all for people with autism for the whole of 2013.  Report after report was produced on that but the service got worse.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's predecessor conveniently avoided telling us when the report was commissioned, when it was published and why there has been a delay.  I became aware that the report had been commissioned in early 2017 and was completed at the end of that year.  It has ten recommendations and nine themes.  The whole of 2018 passed and it seemed the report had not been published until we in Galway asked questions.  The common themes which emerge in the report are the lack of clear pathways, there being no support, no training and so on.  The most important thing is that an implementation body would be set up to implement the report.  It is only being discussed tonight because Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward the motion.  In three paragraphs in the Minister of State's four-page or&aacute;id, which was not very helpful, there was a distinct failure to talk about the report and why it was not implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The report refers to many other reports. Although I will support the motion, the last thing we need is for another committee to sit on the issue and for there to be more reports.  What we want is implementation, and if this motion helps with that, it will certainly have my backing.  To quote one respondent in the report, however, \"Not another review into services for individuals on the autism spectrum [...] it will probably make access to supports and services more difficult than they are at present\".  Another said: \"Adult services are unidentifiable or non-existent.\"  It refers to six reports but I have added a seventh, namely, the report of the Galway Roscommon autism spectrum disorder service from November 2016.  None of its recommendations was implemented.  In fact, through parliamentary questions I have learned that the waiting list for services at the Athenry unit has increased.  It is now at 31 months for intervention and 27 months for assessment.  The non-existence of these services is why we are here tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200046#YY00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1554233700,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion.  I reiterate the crux of the motion, which states that many of the barriers people with autism face are a result of how society responds to those with the condition.  We would do well to remind ourselves that our duty as public representatives is to break down those barriers and provide the necessary supports so that anyone, regardless of disability, can participate in daily life to his or her full potential.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the current Government has placed more impediments before people with autism trying to achieve their full potential.  The main impediment has been a chronic lack of funding during and since the recession.  Legislation and strategies are all well and good but will go nowhere without adequate funding for existing and new supports for people with autism and their families.<\/p>  <p>  I will concentrate my comments on one service that I have been in touch with, a community support service in lnishowen in my constituency of Donegal and one the Government is no stranger to due to the number of times the Department has refused to assist it, despite numerous meetings.<\/p>  <p>  Inishowen Children's Autism Related Education, iCARE, was set up in September 2000 by a small group of visionary parents of children with autism.  In 2006, they opened a centre to provide respite care for these children and their families.  It is a community-led provider of high-quality personal and social services in Inishowen and its funding mainly comes from the community via various fundraising initiatives.  All its services are delivered by volunteers, some casual part-time staff and four T&uacute;s childcare workers.  However, sourcing funding has been a chronic problem for iCARE and a source of great frustration for all involved with the service provider.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke with Ms Angela Tourish, the chairperson of iCARE, about this ongoing struggle.  The group received &euro;36,000 from the HSE last month, despite a costed request for &euro;100,000.  This will soon run out, yet demand for its services increases.  Eight referrals were made in the past six weeks and, in an ironic twist, most of those children were referred to them informally by the HSE and Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Donegal charity faced closure after it lost out on funding from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, will recall that he had allocated &euro;16 million in funding to 27 projects under the Ability programme, half of which were located in Dublin.  Only one service in Donegal received an allocation but that was not to iCARE.<\/p>  <p>  Ms Tourish said something to me that stuck out and represented what the charity is going through.  She stated that closure is always around the corner for them.  It means they cannot make projections or plans for the future and they are living month by month with this hanging over them.  Despite this, they provide vital services with referral from the HSE and Tusla.  This is what we force them to do.<\/p>  <p>  Services such as iCARE should not have to live with closure around the corner.  iCARE can provide that model of community-led care much needed in Donegal and elsewhere.  Community-led services work for children and adults with autism as they provide care within the local area where they can thrive within their own communities.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to consider continuity of care and service provision throughout the life cycle of an individual with autism.  First, supports and outlets need to be provided for those aged 18 and over or as soon as they leave school.  Second, there continues to be a lack of ASD special class places at second level.  These classes do not receive a cent in year-on-year funding while primary schools receive &euro;680 in additional capitation per student per year.  This needs to be equalised so that children with autism can have continuity of care and support throughout their lives.<\/p>  <p>  I qualify everything stated in the motion by calling for a commitment from the Government to provide multi-annual State funding to services such as iCARE and to provide an adequate budget for both State and community-led services with the potential for many more services to open up and deliver for people with autism throughout their life cycle and within their own communities.  It is vitally important so that the Department starts to support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200047#ZZ00100","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1554233700,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Ag bogadh ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; na Rural Independents, who are sharing time with Deputy Butler.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1554233700,"counter":339,"content":"<p>First, I thank most sincerely the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies for bringing this important matter before the House, I acknowledge World Autism Awareness Day, and I welcome each and every person who has come here this evening for this important debate.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the waiting time for children to be assessed is one of the biggest problems that I find in the county that I am elected to represent.  Another is the lack of respite care for families.  Funding for home support respite is needed.  I see that at the coalface, the same as every other Member and every councillor around the country.  Elected representatives are dealing with families who are struggling trying to get access to the vital services they need, whether it is getting the assessment in time or the funding for the supports.  That is what we are trying to highlight here this evening.  Autism-specific adult services are not available at present.<\/p>  <p>  Extra resource hours are needed for schools.  I thank from the bottom of my heart the teachers and SNAs for the work they do throughout the country.  They are a valuable treasure, as the Ceann Comhairle will be aware in his own constituency.

It means that we have to give the person with autism the resources that he or she requires to get the most out of himself or herself.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, there is a lack of funding for Autism Assistance Dogs Ireland.  I acknowledge how valuable it is when a child receives such a dog because assistance dogs, as the organisation itself states, are changing \"the world for children with autism\".  That means so much because that is exactly what they are doing.  They are like a lifeline.  It is like giving them a little person to be with and to grow up with and it is so nice to see it when it is working well.  I acknowledge that great group.

At present, the waiting lists for a child to be assessed are up to two years, and during this period, no supports are in place for families such as an occupational therapist or a speech and language therapist.  I have met a family at first hand in west Cork in the past two weeks who had no other choice than to go away and get a private assessment done, which cost them &euro;1,700.  This was an ordinary family on a basic wage and it was a struggle for them.  From where does the Government think families can come up with such sums?<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure that the Government realises the vital importance of earlier intervention for children under six years.  It is proven that a child's brain is developing at this age.  If early intervention is provided, the child will have a better chance of going on to live an independent life, and has a greater chance of attending mainstream school, which would greatly reduce the need for more unit places.  Surely, this would whet the appetite of the Government, if it thought it could make a cost saving because, in all honesty, the Government has no compassion for families with children with autism and there is no point in appealing to the Government on emotion as all it cares about, sadly, is money.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past few months, I was involved in a local fundraising, \"Lip Sync\", in Bandon to raise much needed funds for Jack &amp;amp; Friends Support Centre in Bandon.  This wonderful centre is run by local parents, such as Claire and Samantha, and is a wonderful amenity to the people of the town and surrounding area.  What many may not realise is that the centre is wholly funded through fundraising and receives no State funding whatsoever.  The centre has running costs of up to &euro;22,000 a year and they are relying on the generosity of the people to keep the centre opened.  In the past five months, this centre applied twice for a grant to kit out its sensory room for the children and on both occasions it was turned down.

My late brother was a paediatrician who was dedicated to issues such as autism, dyspraxia and dyslexia and I learned much from him.  We have learned much over the years.<\/p>  <p>  I salute all the families, all the guide dog associations and all the school special units.  In my own area near the town of Clonmel we did not have a national school.  We had a wonderful preschool.  A year and a half ago, my own national school in Newcastle, and, indeed, Burncourt national school set up two units, but people have to travel that distance from the town.  This year, Clerihane national school has decided to take two rooms and wants to set out the principles.  The teaching staff and the parents' council, and everybody else, including the board of management, have bought into it.  We need more of those.<\/p>  <p>  We need more early diagnosis.  People should not have to pay large sums to go off and get diagnosis.  It is a shame and a scandal to have young people presenting with different symptoms, waiting for assessments and having to go private.  That is blackguarding.  It is not fair to the people.  Families have enough to deal with.  With other siblings and everything else, it can be challenging.<\/p>  <p>  I salute the parents and everybody involved.  I hope we can make better strides here because earlier diagnosis is vital in any of these cases, especially those with autism.<\/p><p>They must be able to move on.<\/p> <p> Holy Trinity national school in Fethard decided in 2017 to go ahead with a unit.  Again, it was agreed by parents, teachers, the principal and the board of management, but because of bureaucracy in the Department, the project must be retendered.  That should not have to be done when the community wants to buy into the idea.  The system should support those schools, as it should support families when it does not.  Families need that help and it must be given to them.  The Minister of State has much serious examination to do and many blackspots must be sorted out.

The inconsistencies that exist in accessing services for autism in the State must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak to one issue, which is the waiting time for a child to be assessed.  Delays in getting assessed result in delayed interventions, and this can ultimately affect the development and well-being of the child.  Every Deputy in the House will say that this is what they are met with every day of the week, with parents coming in who know their child needs an assessment but who have to wait two to three years for it.  Parents have enough on their plate when looking after children with disabilities to have to fight the State and bring a court case so their child can get the required intervention.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2018, there were almost 3,600 children waiting longer than the three months put down in statute.  We need to get our act together.  Children with disabilities and different needs have for too long been forgotten about by the health system.  We are only making this worse for children and their families by delaying intervention.  Every one of us knows a child with autism.  A special little girl visits my house and her name is Tia.  It is so important that every child would get every opportunity to be the best that he or she can be.  The only way to do this is to implement the correct supports.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputies Funchion and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on their work on this matter to date.

I have a vested personal interest as I have a son who is autistic.  Everything I have heard tonight is familiar to me and we have had a typical experience.  We have a lovely young boy, a twin, and Tommy was verbal so we did not really notice for the first few years.  As time went on, we started to notice and we experienced everything I have heard about tonight.  It took us three or four years to get a diagnosis and we had to go private in the end to get it.  We had to take our son Tommy out of ordinary school as he would never cope independently that way.<\/p>  <p>  We have been lucky since and it is not all bad.  He is in a bloody good school in the Setanta school on the Stillorgan Road.  It is a specialist school.  We must celebrate sometimes when there are facilities.  If we do not recognise them, people might think they do not matter and no budget will be provided for them.  Let us celebrate what is good and what has been done.  Much good has been done and things are a hell of a lot better than 20 or 30 years ago, when we had practically no autism services.  I say that as a parent.  I say this knowing all the failings and having seen all that is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I will share some of my experiences.  Much good comes from parents working together in support groups, for example.  One might learn more from other parents than from the system.  The system does not facilitate communication.  We only found out about the school my son attends through a group called Open Spectrum, where we share information.  It is over coffee beside the running track or whatever that one finds out this information.  The school is only two or three miles from the house and we never knew it existed.  Another parent told us and we suggested it to the authorities, so he ended up there.  Sometimes the parents working together come up with very good things.<\/p>  <p>  I speak about my own area but this does not apply to my son because he will never be able to integrate into an ordinary second level school.  There is a real and acute shortage of second level schools where autistic pupils are integrated.  Dublin 6 is the worst area in the country for this because we are so bloody posh.  The schools are so high in the league tables that they cannot afford to have a school with integrated autistic students.  Those kids in those schools will not grow up with other kids with disabilities, so they miss out on that part of their education.  They may end up with a kid with special needs, and if they have not seen it in school, how will they know about the good and difficulties coming with that?  That must change and every school, including the posh ones in Dublin 6, should be integrated.  Some kids with autism can integrate with others and it would benefit the whole school for them to be there.<\/p>  <p>  There was a great court case taken to defend the rights of autistic children to an education, and the Department's response was that because of its limited resources, once a child turned 18, that would be the end of it.  That is a bit of a pity as there is a real gap when people turn 18.  Last but not least, sometimes we seem to be engaged in a process of getting rid of all institutional community settings.  What has happened to Camphill in recent years breaks my heart as I see it as a brilliant institution.  We were kind of hoping our Tommy might end up in Camphill, and it could have been a perfect alternative home.  We should not disperse everybody into the community and we need some institutional group settings.  Let us check the science and facts about putting everybody into the community.  Some adults are not really able to cope in that way, so maybe we still need some institutional care centres.  That is my lived experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200048#AAA00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1554234300,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that valuable insight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200048#AAA00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1554234300,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I commend Deputies Funchion and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on bringing forward this motion.

There are 14,000 students in the country with an autism diagnosis, which is a significant number.  In the very short time available, I raise again a matter that I have raised on numerous occasions, which is the assessment of needs.  I have raised this with the current Taoiseach and previous taoisigh.  We all know there are major delays with assessments of needs despite the HSE being obliged under statute to commence an assessment of needs within three months of notification and to finalise it within a further three months.  In Tipperary, those assessments of needs take 24 months to commence, and this has been the case in recent years.  There is a further waiting period after this extending to 18 months across Tipperary.  Parents are forced either to go private or to seek assistance from the likes of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The vast majority of children are languishing on the waiting lists for the periods I have described.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the question before but I will ask it again of the Minister tonight.  Why is the HSE allowed to breach the law?  There is a statutory obligation on the HSE to do these assessments within the timeframes specified, but it is being broken daily.  It is a matter for this House and the Minister to ensure the assessment of need is done within a specified timeframe.  I support the motion and regret that I have such a short period in which to speak to it.

We are far behind most European countries in terms of having a clear strategy for people living with autism and we continue to have long waiting lists for assessment and access to therapies.  We still have a significant shortage of ASD places in schools and there are problems with transport.  Every September, I see parents who are beside themselves with worry because of the lack of appropriate school transport for their children.  A constituent of mine with several children who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum condition has told me how she spends ridiculous amounts of time chasing up various State bodies and Department to make sure her children's needs are looked after.  There is no joined-up approach so if she does not do it, her children will not receive the treatment, care and services they need.  One of her children was told last September that there was no school transport place for her and that it would take six weeks to organise it despite her having applied the previous April.  Is this supposed to be acceptable?  Is a parent supposed to take time off each morning and afternoon for six weeks or is the child supposed to stay at home for six weeks?  Sadly, this is not an isolated incident.  There are many other cases I could mention.  <\/p> <p> The State needs to recognise and support the needs of people by setting up an all-party committee to deliver an autism empowerment strategy for Ireland.

I thank Deputies Funchion and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for bringing forward this motion, which is incredibly important and long overdue.  Many of us have met stakeholders since we were elected.  This is a progression of what we were trying to do.  There is not a single one of us who has not experienced people coming to his or her constituency clinics in a desperate state whether it is about looking for a school place for their child, services or assessments.  The situation, which involves children waiting, is criminal.  The Government is obliged to see them within a specific timeframe but it does not do so.  It is a scandal.  I do not have to tell the Minister of State that early intervention is key for people with autism.  I know that given the right support, many people with autism can participate meaningfully and make a valuable contribution to society due to a different way of seeing and understanding the world.  When identified early, important supports can be put in place to ensure people are enabled to develop strategies that make their lives easier.  Early interventions also aim to develop skills in communication, social interaction and imagination that underpin adaptive function to provide the person with the highest possible quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that adequate resources are in place for people with autism to ensure they get the support they need in the classroom and areas like speech and language therapy.  Schools at all levels from private preschools up to secondary schools need to ensure they have the resources in place to make it as easy as possible for people with autism.  These schools must ensure they are open and welcoming to people with autism and provide for their needs.  I echo the comments of Deputy Eamon Ryan.  It is not just Dublin 6 that has posh schools.  They include schools all over the State and my own city is particularly bad in that regard.  These schools want to be top of a league and exclude children with disabilities, children with autism and Traveller children.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  They do it non-stop.  The Minister of State knows that the Minister for Education and Skills will not insist that local primary schools that are feeder schools for these secondary schools take these children.  We will not stop that unless we look at that issue as well.  The current range of services are not consistently available across the State.  When people try to access them, it is really difficult.  <\/p>  <p>  The motion calls for the establishment of an all-party committee on autism with input from people with autism, which is crucial, and their families.  I would particularly like the committee to look at the supports that need to be developed in our workplaces to give people with autism the full range of supports needed to enable them to participate in the workplace.

The current situation, where we have no strategy, is crazy despite such a strategy being in place in most European countries.  That we must go to this length and table a Private Members' motion to get something so basic for those families in the Public Gallery and those listening at home shames this House.  Like others, I have had families come to see me.  The system in my constituency is broken.  There are 11 units in the primary school sector.  There are no suitable secondary schools.  Perhaps I am not great on maths but where do these children go?  The parents want to know where to send their children.  Does the Minister of State have an answer because the parents are looking for answers and that is why they come to my office?  They have nowhere to send their children in the secondary sector.  There are 18 suitable secondary schools in Dublin.  People across Dublin are asking where they should send their children.  It does not add up.<\/p>  <p>  We know from the last census figures that the population is growing.  As we are getting better at identifying these issues in children, demand will grow and we need to put resources in place.  When I ask questions, the only thing I hear is that 100 workers will be deployed in this area.  When I asked about the unit that is supposed to be established in the CHO 7 area, I was told that there is no team manager, the post of staff grade educational psychologist has been vacant from 14 December, there is no staff grade psychologist or occupational therapist and many other key positions are vacant.  Clearly, children are going into the system but it is going nowhere.  A reply from the HSE informed me that the waiting time for the school-age team, SAT, is 42 months and growing monthly because the team does not have the capacity to safely take on additional cases and that there has been no movement on the waiting list in the past 12 months due to the volume of children who are transitioning from early intervention services, the capacity case load of team members, delays in filling vacancies and maternity leave positions not being filled.  The system is broken.  What do I do?  I write to the Minister of State, the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills, and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, and they all tell me it is not their area but somebody else's area but at the end of the day, where do these families go?  I am encouraging families to take court cases to get their rights.

Wonderful steps forward are being made in terms of recognising the strengths of autistic people but we desperately need to focus on addressing how to manage and support the significant challenges faced by so many autistic people.

Both personally and as a Minister of State, I want everyone with additional needs, including those with autism spectrum disorder, to have access to necessary supports in every aspect of their lives to enable them to achieve their full potential, maximise their independence and live rich and fulfilling lives.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the cross-departmental nature of the supports required by people with disabilities, in 2017 the Department of Justice and Equality published the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.  The strategy takes a whole-of-Government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities, both in a practical sense and in creating the best possible opportunities for people with disabilities to fulfil their potential.  It is intended to make a significant difference over its lifetime in the position of people with disabilities in Irish society.  Under the strategy, the Government is committed to ensuring people with autism will be empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society.  The strategy is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.  It was informed by a comprehensive consultation process that took place during 2016 when an open call was issued to people with disabilities, their families and disability organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The actions included in the national disability inclusion strategy generally relate and apply to people with disabilities, but it also contains specific actions in respect of autism.  The programme of actions on autism is in keeping with the cross-disability, whole-of-Government, social model of disability approach set out in the national disability strategy implementation plan.  It also recognises, however, that an increased understanding of autism across the public sector is required to ensure the implementation of the plan will address the needs of people with autism.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Department of Justice and Equality established the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which is responsible for monitoring implementation of the strategy and comprises representatives of key Departments, the NDA and the disability stakeholders group.  As outlined previously, the HSE is  implementing some major policy initiatives in children's disability services.  The policies have the common goal of improving service delivery for all children with additional needs, including those with autism.  We want to ensure there is equitable access to services, that waiting lists will be reduced and that all children will receive the supports they need when they need them.  The planned publication by the HSE of an autism plan later this year further shows the Government's commitment to improving services for children and adults with autism.<\/p>  <p>  Inclusion of children with special educational needs, including those with autism, has been and continues to be a priority for the Government.  The move towards allocating supports based on need rather than diagnosis is mirrored in disability health services.  This is a really important policy as it reflects the diversity of individuals and the multitude of needs that can hide behind a common name.  The Government will continue to strongly support provision in special education in order to ensure an inclusive model of education which will have regard to the policy advice of the NCSE and be informed by what is appropriate in meeting the educational needs of children in schools.  The NCSE is undertaking policy advice on educational provision in special classes and special schools.  In the course of preparing the advice the council will consult widely with stakeholders.  The policy advice is to be completed next year.<\/p>  <p>  I again thank Deputies for highlighting this important issue on World Autism Awareness Day.  I reiterate the Government's sincere and ongoing commitment to the improvement of services and supports for all individuals with additional needs, including those with autism.  The national disability inclusion strategy provides the blueprint for improving services and it is by working together across Departments that we will make a difference for all people with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200050#CCC00100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1554235500,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Deputy Louise O'Reilly is sharing time with Deputy Funchion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200050#CCC00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1554235500,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Yes and with two other Deputies.<\/p><p>The Minister of State did not answer the specific question he was asked.

It is the Government patting itself on the back and stating it does not need to take any action because everything it is doing is grand.  However, everything it is doing means that parents in my constituency have to wait 36 months, or three years, for services.  They have to wait 18 to 24 months just for an assessment.  The Minister of State has talked to mothers in my constituency; he should talk to mothers in his own.  It is a battle.  That is the word they use.  They battle with the system and the Government and they battle and fight for their kids, yet the Minister of State has come here with a script that states, &quot;it is not proposed to pursue legislation or an Oireachtas committee on autism&quot;.  That is precisely for what the motion calls - the establishment of an Oireachtas committee.  It is supported by every other party and Independent Deputy, but the Government has come here and not been honest because the Minister of State left out this line from his speech to the House.

We have heard fine words all evening for people who are dealing with autism and the system.  We have spent the entire evening talking about how they deserve to be treated better.  However, the message coming from the Government is that it is going to say fine words, but, in truth, it is not going to do anything.  I really regret that the Minister of State did not move to clarify the Government's position and I think the people in the Visitors Gallery probably do too, although they will just add it to the list of things they regret because every single day they deal with what the Government is doing to people with autism and their families in the battles they have to fight.  <\/p><p>I had a script - I was going to focus on health issues - but I am extremely angry that the Minister of State has not addressed the issue raised with his colleague, An Teachta Finian McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200050#CCC00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1554235500,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I commend Deputies Funchion and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on bringing forward the motion.  As a society and certainly as a state, we are failing people with autism.  Every child deserves a chance to develop and grow to achieve his or her full potential and every time the State and society fail to provide services, assessments and supports, it becomes that bit harder for a child to reach his or her full potential.  As a society, we are failing children with autism and nowhere is this more true than in Cork.  There are many statutory funded schools and organisations that do great work, including Scoil Triest, St. Gabriel's, Sonas, the Brothers of Charity and Scoil Cara which I have mentioned in this House on many occasions when discussing multidisciplinary teams.  However, despite the efforts of these agencies, we have inadequate services.  We have the worst waiting lists in Ireland, with the number of assessments awaiting completion in Cork city and county at the end of last year at over 1,000.  When assessments are not carried out quickly - invariably they are not - services are slow to follow.  They are slow to follow in any event.  What Deputy O'Reilly said registered with me having regard to what I hear from parents.  It is a fight.  Everything is a fight.  If one needs services for one's school, it is a fight.  If one needs services at home, it is a fight.  Everything they get and whatever they get which is usually a long way short of for what they might ask or require comes following a fight.<\/p>  <p>  We are fortunate that in many instances community and voluntary services have stepped up to the mark.  I highlight, in particular, the Rainbow Club which is based in Mahon Community Centre in Cork.  It was started in 2015 by Jon and Karen O'Mahony.  It has since grown to operate at full capacity of 623 children.  There is a waiting list of more than 226 families.  People are often referred to it by the HSE when they cannot access other services.  It is incredible to me that a voluntary service would have a waiting list of this scale.  It says to me the State is failing when a voluntary organisation has had to step in.  <\/p>  <p>  I also commend Tony O'Donovan from Togher who has piloted autism-friendly shopping days in many shopping centres.<\/p><p>Those are voluntary efforts, however.  The Government needs to step forward and show the same initiative as those voluntary organisations.  That is what we need and that is what this motion is calling for.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200050#CCC00400","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554236100,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le mo chomhghleacaithe, na Teachta&iacute; Funchion agus &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in fa choinne an r&uacute;in seo chun comhairle a &eacute;ileamh ar an Rialtas.  We have heard many stories from people recounting their experiences of children and adults with autism.  We have heard much support for the motion.  I also listened to the Minister of State and his comments on what the Government is doing and how it is supporting this motion.  It was disingenuous, however, to stand up, deliver a ten-minute speech and leave out the two lines which indicate the position of the Government on this issue.  The Government is not going to legislate and is not going to set up a committee.  Children with autism are literal.  When they hear the Government is supporting this motion, they expect it to follow through, establish the committee and legislate.<\/p>  <p>  It is a terrible slight on them and their parents.  We have heard about the slog, the difficulty, the challenges and the fighting required all of the time to get different services.  We have also heard of the anxiety and worry waiting for an assessment and what the results will show, then follows the repeated fight for resources for therapies and access to all of the different supports that should be there to help.  It is a case of fighting the system, however, rather than being comforted by it.  One issue the Government has not acknowledged is that the current system is failing children in myriad ways.  I refer to delays in assessment, the lack of supports available, the lack of educational supports and the lack of available places.  All of that is failing children.  The motion seeks something simple.  It asks that we get together as legislators who want to see, recognise and value the unique way in which children and adults with autism see this world.  Let us come together and develop a strategy and let us underpin it with legislation.  The Minister of State should do the right thing and support the motion tabled by Deputies Funchion and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. It deserves the support of all of us in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040200051#DDD00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1554236100,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank all colleagues, from my party and the other parties, for their support, comments and personal stories.  I refer to Deputy Eamon Ryan, in particular, for his personal insight.  I thank everyone who told their own story.  As can be seen, we all know the situation.  Everything is a battle.  I refer to everything from before getting a diagnosis, to securing school places and occupational therapy all the way through to becoming an adult and trying to transition into adult services where there is a lack of respite and day services.  The list is endless and the battle is constant for parents.<\/p>  <p>  Whether the Government decides to support the motion or sit on the fence, we know we have the support of the majority of Deputies in this House.  We will call a vote if we have to and we are not giving up on this issue.  I appeal to the Ceann Comhairle.  We have majority support and we will ask him to set up the all-party committee.  I believe that is within the remit of the Ceann Comhairle and we have always found him to be fair and reasonable.  We appeal to him to support that as we have the majority.  I state that because the committee is needed to develop a strategy.  We do not have one and we need one.  All these problems are not going to go away.  The important thing about the all-party committee is that it will deal directly with people with autism, parents and advocacy groups.  All of the people watching from the Public Gallery will have an input.  That is crucial.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague mentioned some of the groups earlier but I want to also briefly mention Enough is Enough, particularly Linda and Vanessa, for the work done and their input into the motion.  I thank them for the support and advice they give me.  I also want to mention one of the first cases I ever dealt with.  I will not mention the name, but his parents will know who I am talking about.  He is an amazing, fantastic teenager failed repeatedly by this State who has not had the opportunity to finish his education.  The responsibility for that lies at the door of the Government.  We are not giving up on this issue.  I want to make that clear.  We are going to keep fighting until we get the committee and that strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, behind the scenes in all of this are staff who worked hard in helping to draft the motion and deal with people like me.  I thank Dee, Avril, Kaniah and Michael for all their work on this issue.  I again sincerely thank those in the Public Gallery.  I reiterate our commitment to them.
