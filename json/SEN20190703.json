In January 2018, briefs of requirements were received for five stations, including Ballinspittle.  The OPW undertook a technical assessment of all the buildings to ascertain the scope of works needed to reopen each of the stations.  It compiled indicative costings based on information supplied and the relevant scope of works.  It wrote to the then acting Garda Commissioner in April 2018, providing details and indicative costs for each of the six Garda stations, highlighting key issues and decisions to be made.<\/p> <p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote to the Department of Justice and Equality in July 2018 outlining their requirements, suggesting possible solutions and seeking a capital provision of &euro;2.56 million for the programme and approval to proceed.<\/p> <p>In July 2018, the OPW received confirmation from the Department of Justice and Equality that funding was available and that the OPW was to proceed with the implementation of the reopening of the six pilot Garda stations.  The OPW fully engaged with Garda estate management to agree the definitive project brief for each station.<\/p> <p>The OPW commenced by undertaking technical surveys on the Ballinspittle Garda station building.  Garda estate management forwarded a revised brief of requirements in August 2018.  A revised crime prevention report and telecommunications report were received in September 2018.

I express my sincere thanks to him for making the long trek from west Cork to Belmullet in north Mayo last Monday to engage with staff and patients in Belmullet District Hospital.  They found it a fruitful experience.  I genuinely thank the Minister of State for making the effort and recommending the preservation of the 20 acute beds in the hospital.  It was an excellent decision, for which I express my thanks.<\/p> <p>I was contacted by Councillor Michael Sheehan from Wexford about the reduction in services at New Houghton Hospital in New Ross and other community hospitals.  What are the Government's plans for the future of the district hospital network in the light of unprecedented overcrowding in the acute hospital sector?  We spoke about this issue the other day and Councillor Sheehan contacted me about New Houghton Hospital, formerly a fever hospital that has been lauded for its quality staff and delivery of care in the community.  In the past few years, like many other district hospitals, it has become a care centre for patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease and those suffering from chronic illnesses.  At its peak, it accommodated approximately 80 patients, but with new HSE regulations and guidelines, it has been downsized to 50.  However, in the past few months, I understand the HSE has not permitted the admission of any new patient.  There are around 30 in the hospital.  My understanding is a significant number of beds are available in the hospital that could be used to alleviate pressure in Wexford and Waterford, including in other acute HSE hospitals.  The staff have been recognised as doing an excellent job, but, of course, I would expect them to be worried about the future of the facility, given the inability to admit new patients.  <\/p> <p>HIQA has noted the poor quality of the approach road and the green areas immediately around the hospital as limiting capacity for the residents, but it has also stated the care provided in the hospital is excellent.  Given the cuts made by the HSE to local facilities, I am concerned that the hospital will be downgraded.  The public in the locality is concerned about an even worse outcome, that it might eventually be closed.  That would be a devastating blow to many families in the locality, employees and patients, particularly after the local community raised much-needed funds through Friends of the New Houghton Hospital to provide extra services, equipment and amenities such as a sensory garden.  <\/p> <p>The HSE claims that there is no demand for the 20 unoccupied beds and that any demand for services has been met by private organisations locally.  The question is, as the Minister of State is aware, as we have spoken about the issue, why pay private facilities when HSE beds in the locality are available?  It sounds suspiciously like the possibility that elderly healthcare services in the area will be privatised.  <\/p> <p>I have spoken about the district hospital network since I was elected to the Seanad.  The Minister of State knows how passionate I am about it.  The hospitals play a vital role in the delivery of a modern healthcare service.  Any reduction in the services provided at New Houghton Hospital would be counter-intuitive and counter-productive and fly in the face of Government policy.  As the Minister of State is aware, the district hospital network prevents admissions to the acute sector and facilitate discharges.  Without a lot of investment but with appropriate investment, the district hospital network could provide extra services and prevent people, particularly the elderly, from having to travel long distances to avail of services.  In doing so they often have to depend on a public transport system that is inadequate in certain parts of the country or the road network.  Lateral thinking is needed.  As I said to the Minister of State on Monday, outreach clinics to provide, for example, cardiac or respiratory rehabilitation services, could be held in these facilities.  <\/p> <p>I seek an update on the posittion at New Houghton Hospital.  How does the Minister of State feel about the expansion of the district hospital network nationally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#B00300","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his welcome and comments about my trip to Belmullet.  It is always nice to see a familiar and friendly face when one goes on such a trip and to meet a medical officer with whom I am familiar.  I thank the Senator for the courtesy he showed me during my visit.<\/p> <p>Residential care is provided through a mix of public. voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the net budget for long-term residential care in 2019 is &euro;985 million and that over 23,000 clients, on average, at any one time will be in receipt of financial support.  Public residential care units such as New Houghton Hlospital in New Ross, County Wexford are an essential part of the healthcare infrastructure.  In total, they provide about 5,000 long-stay beds, amounting to approximately 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds nationally.  There are also about 2,000 short-stay community public beds.  The standard of care delivered to residents in these units is generally very high, but we recognise that many public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modem context.  Without them, however, many older people would not have access to the care they need.  It is important, therefore, that we upgrade the public bed stock.  That is the aim of the five-year capital investment programme for community nursing units which was announced in 2016.  It provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  <\/p> <p>The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including the facility at New Houghton Hospital.  HSE Community Health Organisation 5 which includes County Wcx lord is committed to delivering services for older persons through a community-based approach that supports older people to live in their own homes and communities and, when needed, residential care centres such as New Houghton Hospital.  The hospital which dates from the 1970s is registered with HIQA as a residential long-stay unit, with a maximum of 42 beds.  Services provided include long-term care, dementia care, rehabilitation, convalescence and respite, palliative and end-of-life care services.  The HSE has informed the Department that the hospital has an excellent reputation locally as a care facility, that the welfare of residents is a priority for staff and management and that they are deeply appreciative of the support the hospital receives from families and the wider community.  However, the HSE has also informed my Department that demand for beds at the hospital has decreased, in part because of the availability of residential beds in new facilities in the New Ross area.  I have requested more detailed information from the HSE in that regard in order that my officials can properly evaluate the situation.  I will be happy to update the House again in due course.  <\/p> <p>In addition, the HSE has experienced challenges in recruiting and retaining required staffing.  As a result and to continue to provide quality care, while at the same time providing additional personal and communal space for residents in line with regulatory requirements, in recent months the number of operational beds in the hospital has decreased to 31.  In line with usual processes, the HSE will continue to review all of its services to ensure the continued provision of high quality, value for money residential care, with the older person at the centre of all decisions made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#B00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

We must ensure that these children, like others, achieve their full potential.<\/p><p>Over the past year, one would think that these families were asking for something to which they are not entitled.  They have been wronged by this State and we need to ensure that proper supports are put in place for these children.  I have been working with the chief health officer in area 2, Mr. Tony Canavan.  At that time, I asked questions of the HSE, as part of the Department of Health, and the Departments of Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

In April 2011, the HSE published the report of its national audiology review group, NARG.  The group developed recommendations to address inconsistencies and inadequacies in audiology services.  Arising from the recommendations of the review group, the HSE appointed a national clinical lead for audiology and four assistant regional clinical leads to deliver a modernisation programme and to implement new care pathways and improved clinical governance.  The newly appointed HSE assistant national lead raised concerns about the standard of audiology assessments and hearing aid management provided in Mayo-Roscommon.<\/p> <p>Following on from these concerns, the HSE commissioned a look-back review of paediatric audiology services in Mayo-Roscommon during the period 2011 to 2015.  In June 2018, the look-back report was finalised and shared with the families of 49 children who were identified in the report as needing follow-up care.<\/p> <p>Since then the HSE has provided a comprehensive programme of services, where required, to all 49 children identified in the report.  In addition, the HSE has assisted parents in accessing necessary educational and social protection services.  The implementation of the programme of supports and services has been led by the chief officer in HSE west and has been facilitated by a dedicated named point of contact based in the HSE west primary care office.  These services include occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, psychology, counselling for parents, ophthalmology, funding for lT, audiology equipment, and aids and appliances.  A HSE liaison contact person has assisted families in many areas, including completing applications for services and communicating with other Departments and agencies.  Families have been reimbursed where they have had to source services privately and for expenses associated with attending audiology related appointments. These services include play therapy, art therapy, educational psychology, and private ear, nose and throat consultant appointments.<\/p> <p>Nine families have contacted the Department of Education and Skills.  A review of the educational supports available to these children has been completed.  The Department has contacted schools and parents or guardians, as appropriate, on the outcome of its review.  The educational needs of these children have been assessed and appropriate supports and assistive technologies have been provided.  Domiciliary care allowance applications have been allowed in respect of five hearing loss related applications, one has not been allowed after appeal, and one is going through the appeal process.  The chief officer of HSE west has chaired a number of meetings with families.  These meetings have been attended by senior officials in other Departments and agencies.<\/p> <p>The HSE has apologised to all of the families for the inadequate services provided to all of the children concerned during the period in question and is ensuring that appropriate follow-up facilities are put in place.  It is important to remember that the failures in question came to light through various initiatives to improve the quality of service, first by the commissioning of the NARG report to set standards of care, second, by the appointment of the new assistant regional audiology lead to assess the level of services provided in Mayo-Roscommon against the standards and recommendations contained in the NARG report, and subsequently by the commissioning of the look-back review to investigate the concerns raised by the new audiology lead.

Indeed the HSE has warned that it would be almost impossible to deliver the planned, multi-billion euro investments in new healthcare facilities in the coming years because of the cost overruns at the national children's hospital.  A recent report showed that the overrun means healthcare will need an additional &euro;107 million in 2020, &euro;120 million in 2021 and &euro;150 million in 2022.  The HSE has been concerned for some time, apparently, that the &euro;11 billion funding arrangements for new hospitals, nursing homes, ambulances and equipment under the Ireland 2040 capital development plan are not balanced and that most of these large-scale projects are pushed out to the last ten years of the plan.<\/p> <p>The HSE stated that the issue, along with having to deal with cost overruns from the new children's hospital in the years 2020 to 2022, \"has made what was a very difficult situation now almost impossible\".  I understand the Cabinet was told last December that a number of health projects might have to be curtailed and others might have to be suspended completely due to the soaring costs of the children's hospital.<\/p> <p>A letter to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, dated 3 May, from then acting director general of the HSE, Ms Anne O'Connor, outlined growing concerns about the capital funding position of the organisation and the emerging impact of the children's hospital on its overall capital programme.

The HSE has advised that projects to deliver a primary care centre and an upgraded mental health residential unit on the St. Davnet&rsquo;s campus in Monaghan town are under way.  The north Monaghan primary care centre will be developed by way of a major refurbishment of Blackwater house at St. Davnet&rsquo;s campus in Monaghan town.<\/p> <p>The appointed design team is engaging in pre-planning meetings with Monaghan County Council's planning department.  The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.  In addition, the HSE is extending and refurbishing a building on the St Davnet&rsquo;s campus to provide accommodation to allow for the decanting of services that utilise some of the space in Blackwater house.  This upgraded residential mental health unit is under construction and is a key enabler for the primary care centre development project.  These developments will enable staff to deliver optimal quality care and treatment in facilities which afford dignity, respect and privacy to all.<\/p> <p>Funding for these development projects in Monaghan has been included in the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative, announced last year.  This provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care.  The delivery of these projects and programmes, including developments in County Monaghan, will result in healthcare facilities that allow for the implementation of new models of care and for the delivery of services in high-quality modern facilities.<\/p> <p>The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a vital and much-needed project and the Government has examined the funding pressures associated with delivering this important project.  In meeting these funding pressures, the Government has examined all projects and programmes across Government and has made adjustments to ensure that the much-needed new children's hospital will be delivered and will facilitate the delivery of the overall investment programme as set out in Project Ireland 2040.  The Government provided an additional &euro;75 million of capital funding in 2019 towards the increased costs of the new children's hospital.  The summer economic statement provides a capital expenditure reserve of up to &euro;200 million in 2020 to accommodate the funding requirements for the new children's hospital and the national broadband plan.  This will allow my Department and the HSE to finalise a multi-annual capital plan.<\/p> <p>The health capital allocation in 2019 is &euro;642 million for the construction and equipping of health facilities.  This represents an increase of &euro;224 million on last year's capital provision for the public health sector.  This Government will continue to invest in the public health sector and will deliver the new children's hospital and a wide range of health capital projects in hospitals, social care and the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#D00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and I look forward to the delivery of the primary care centre and other health projects on time and without delay in County Monaghan.

Clearly, projects will not go ahead because of the cost overruns and I would imagine that building new hospitals to deal with elective surgery would be one of the projects that will not proceed.

Next year, there is a &euro;200 million additional reserve included in the summer economic statement to allow for any increased costs associated with either that or the national broadband plan, so there is no reason for us to challenge and question continually the validity of the building programme.

A report by the living wage technical group proposes that the living wage should increase by 40 cent.  The challenge relates to the supply of affordable housing to buy or rent.  The Mercer annual cost-of-living survey highlighted that Dublin remains the most expensive city in the eurozone, primarily due to its high rents.  According to <i>daft.ie<\/i>, single people in Dublin spend 58.8% of their net take-home pay on rent while those living in towns pay 33% of their income on rent.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is not a criticism of the Government as such, but we all acknowledge that the cost of housing has gone up so much that it is unaffordable for first-time buyers in Dublin, in the commuter belt generally and in other cities and towns.  The Government is doing a certain amount in terms of supply, but we cannot underestimate how much supply is needed.  It is crucial that we take action without delay in this regard.<\/p><p>I refer briefly to the nomination of Germany's defence minister, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, as President of the European Commission.  When the news emerged last night, some of us thought she might be a relative of Senator Leyden.  However, there is no \"d\" in her surname, so there is probably no connection after all.  Ms von der Leyen has been a staunch supporter of Britain's remaining in the European Union.  Her description of Brexit as a loss for everyone is something with which most of us in this House concur.  Brexit is, above anything else, a lose-lose situation.  I hope she will be successful in her term as President.  We will have statements later today on the EU-Mercosur trade deal, which is very important in the context of Brexit.  We are looking at the possibility of up to 99,000 tonnes of additional beef coming into the EU market at a time when Britain is leaving, or potentially leaving, the Union.  It is a huge challenge for us and I welcome the debate.<\/p><p>We heard yesterday from the Minister for Health of further overspending in the health service.  The additional expenditure of &euro;13 million in April brings the overspend for the first four months of the year to &euro;216 million.  While I wish Mr. Paul Reid, former chief executive of Fingal County Council, all the best in his new job as director general of the Health Service Executive, we must have an examination of how these moneys are being spent and why expenditure is going over budget continually.  A particularly pressing issue is the situation of the 6,000 people seeking home help hours.  If that provision were granted, people would be able to move out of healthcare facilities and return home.  It is a no-brainer in terms of the HSE's budget because the more home help hours are provided, the fewer people there are in hospitals clogging up the system.  Those people neither need nor want to be hospital, but they cannot go home in the absence of home help provision.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House to explain how he is managing the budget or, more accurately, not managing the budget as well as we would like him to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#G00700","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>The next speaker indicating is Senator Lawless, who represents the diaspora.

Once told might be enough in this instance.  I welcome my family and close friends from Chicago who are in the Gallery today.  Last week I welcomed the announcement by the Government of its intention to publish the scheme of a Bill to facilitate a referendum on whether members of the diaspora should be entitled to vote in presidential elections.  We have already seen the emergence of a number of myths designed to instil fear in an electorate that has shown itself time and again to be brave enough to ignore such misinformation and say &quot;Yes&quot;.  I am confident that this generation we will see through the scaremongering that has begun.  One letter writer to <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>last weekend was concerned that the sheer number of Irish voters living abroad could &quot;distort any election result&quot;.  What does this person mean by &quot;distort&quot;?  Did those who came home to vote in recent referenda distort the vote on those occasions?  Did their willingness to catch boats, trains and planes home to express their democratic view on issues affecting their nation amount to a distortion of our values?  I say, &quot;Absolutely not&quot;.<\/p><p>Before the referendum, I urge Irish people to ask themselves what type of person is likely to turn up at the Irish Embassy in Washington or London to have their say in who should be the next President of Ireland?  Is it someone who does not care about our nation or about what it means to be Irish in the 21st century?  Or is it someone who actively wants to remain part of the Irish community even when not living on this island?  The evidence from overseas is that those who take the bother of going to their embassy or exercising a postal vote are people who are actively interested in what is happening in their home country.  It was recently reported in Australia that of those living abroad who were eligible to vote in recent elections in that country, just 16% chose to do so.  If passed, this referendum will allow all eligible citizens to vote in Irish presidential elections.  That opportunity will be taken up by those who engage in the campaign and with the presidential candidates vying for their vote and setting out a global image of Ireland.<\/p><p>We are among just three EU countries having a directly elected president which do not allow emigrants a say in elections for that office.  I am extremely proud, as an Irishman and a European, that since joining the Union, Ireland has always championed its relationship with its diaspora as more than just one of economic transactions but, rather, as one comprising a community of ideas and nations.  We should bring ourselves in line with our fellow European citizens who freely move and work across the Continent and allow their emigrants a vote in elections.  Twenty-four European Union countries already do this.  What is there to fear in our doing the same?  Imagine the message we will send to the world if we say &quot;Yes&quot; in October just as our neighbour is shutting down its borders and making an historic mistake of catastrophic proportions?  In Britain's scheduled exit from the Union, we will have an opportunity once again to show how broad are our shoulders and how open are our minds to what it truly means to be an Irish man or woman in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#H00300","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank those who took part in the Dublin Pride demonstrations at the weekend.  Unfortunately, I was speaking in Kells and could not attend.  I definitely had a case of FOMO - fear of missing out - looking at the pictures on Instagram and seeing how special the parade was, as it always is.  Considering the origins of Pride as an active protest movement, it was great to see the grassroots activist group, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, ACT UP, leading the parade and putting at the centre of the day's events its incredibly important message that, due to health advancements, persons on active HIV medication cannot pass on the virus to sexual partners.  I welcome the news that the HIV preventative medication, pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, will soon be available free of charge through the HSE, thanks in no small part to the incredible advocacy of organisations like ACT UP.<\/p> <p>In the context of the huge and visible support for the broader LGBT Pride parade in Dublin last weekend, I draw Members' attention to what will be a smaller but no less important demonstration, namely, Dublin's Trans Pride parade, which takes place this coming Saturday from the Garden of Remembrance.  Ireland has an incredible record in recent years of increasing the acceptance and visibility of the transgender community, most notably through the Gender Recognition Act, which is one of the few laws in the world that allows for legal self-identification of gender.  Our colleague, Senator Humphreys, deserves credit for advancing that legislation during his time as Minister of State.  However, transgender people in Ireland still experience disproportionately high levels of marginalisation and discrimination.  The demonstration this Saturday is about highlighting and opposing all forms of transphobia.  Gender identity must be recognised within our anti-discrimination laws.  In particular, we need hate crime legislation that encompasses all types of racial and LGBT hatred and which specifically recognises gender identity.  Access to gender-neutral bathrooms must become the norm in all public spaces, including in Leinster House.  We must do much better on access to healthcare for trans people.  This is a minority community with high levels of health needs.  We must ensure that hormone replacement therapy, speech therapy and surgery are available and accessible in a timely manner.  I welcome the decision by the Minister, Deputy Harris, to set up a working group alongside activists such as Noah Halpin.  However, I hear reports today from the This is Me transgender healthcare campaign that the only surgeon in the country, who does top surgery, is due to retire and there are no plans to hire a replacement.  This is an example of where improvements can be made for a community that needs support from the State.  These are issues requiring urgent attention and I ask the Leader to bring them to the Government.

They are not wrong, as we learned yesterday again with the launch by Ulster Bank of yet another sale of mortgages.  Ulster Bank is selling &euro;900 million worth of loans, including loans in respect of 3,200 family homes.  Nevertheless, we give those funds charitable status in case they would have to pay any corporation tax.  Fine Gael has ushered in the golden age of the vultures.  Deputy Noonan told us many years ago that we needed them desperately.  We absolutely do not.  Why do we not give the discounts the banks are giving to the vulture funds to the 3,200 family homeowners and others?  Why are we not reaching deals with them?  We would rather reach deals with the vulture funds and give them major haircuts on the loans.  For distressed borrowers, it is the age of despair.  The people who are supposed to control the vultures and stand up for what is right are instead feeding them.  AIB is a State-owned bank but it is writing to customers to threaten them with vultures.

Currently, they have no pathway to residency.  Colleagues may recall that in the autumn, we tabled a Labour Party Private Members' Bill which would provide pathways to residency for such children.  The Bill was supported by the Migrant Rights Centre and we will certainly move to make progress on it over the coming months.  I hope we will see some movement in that regard over the summer and would like the House to debate the issue in due course.

There is a need to debate with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government where we are going with rent pressure zones and how effective they have been in some areas.  The Leader will have a great interest in what I am going to say about the town of Carrigaline, half of which is in a rent pressure zone while the other half is not.  The metrics formulated in respect of the new constituency boundaries meant the only way it would work was if the northern half of Carrigaline was removed from the zone, which is not appropriate.  This is about looking at rent pressure zones and how we deal with them.  We are dealing with them on a local-election constituency basis but that is to base them on too great a geographical area.  It does not make logical sense to have a rent pressure zone in one local election district.  We need to look at legislation on how we define a rent pressure zone.  A rent pressure zone should include a town and its hinterland.  For example, Kinsale is not in a rent pressure zone.  It is literally 20 miles away from the rent pressure zone in Cork city yet it has the highest rents in Ireland.  We need to do something so that places like Kinsale do not have the extraordinary rents they do and which are increasing on a multiple basis.<\/p> <p>The whole precept of basing rent pressure zones on electoral districts does not make sense.  We need to look at it again and change it.  Carrigaline as an entity needs to be together as a single rent pressure zone.  Kinsale must also be zoned because the pressure is within the town, not its rural hinterland.  The Leader might back me on this.  We need to get the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in here for a serious debate about where we are going to go on rent pressure zones.  People are paying extraordinary rents in some areas and we must ensure we give them the benefit of the security of a rent pressure zone.  For that to happen, we must change how we measure and define things.  We are defining these zones too widely and need to bring them back down to the urban centres where the greatest pressures exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#J00700","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I welcome the family of Senator Lawless to the Chamber and hope they enjoy their day in Leinster House.

There were two speakers, the first of whom was Dr. Helen Rochford Brennan who is a sufferer and a carer for her husband in addition to being chairperson of the European working group of people with dementia and a member of the Irish dementia working group.  She talked about the disease and how 50,000 people, of whom she is one, currently struggle with the disease in this country.  She travels all across Europe promoting more supports for people who suffer from the disease.  Across Europe, dementia is now called the cancer of the future.

We have spoken about Libya and Ireland's relationship, via the EU, with the Libyan coastguard and about the human rights concerns arising from it.  There are also deep concerns about some of the funding that has been provided by Ireland, through the European Union, to rapid support forces in Sudan.  According to many human rights bodies, these forces have strong links with the former military regime.  It has also been suggested that, in some cases, they may have links with the Janjaweed.  These rapid support forces have been engaged in very violent action against protestors and civil society in Sudan.  Given that the African Union has suspended recognition of Sudan, Ireland should question whether we should fund military forces that are not recognised.  I was very inspired by the Sudanese civil society groups that spoke to us.  Young people spoke about picking up paintbrushes, cameras, pencils, and microphones instead of weapons to ensure a peaceful transition to civilian-led government.  That is now the issue.  As a country with experience of peace negotiations, Ireland can, and should, play a useful role in supporting Ethiopia, which is seeking to act as a mediator in ensuring a peaceful transition.  Some of these issues may be covered by the Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  Alternatively the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade may speak about the role Ireland may play in the coming months, over the summer, while the House will be in recess.  I would love it if we could find even an hour on the schedule to discuss this issue before the recess so that Ireland can support this peaceful transition.<\/p><p>Another issue which will arise over the summer is that we will again see many die in the Mediterranean.

Many of us have articulated viewpoints in favour of improving the living conditions of all people.

There is a need to recognise that health is a demand-led service.  It is about people and it is not a bookkeeping exercise, nor should it be.  Earlier Members raised issues relating to home help hours and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which has legitimate claims and advocacy rights.  We need to put in place supports for all people.  I would like to have that debate the Senator called for.  <\/p><p>Senator Lawless mentioned the referendum on the diaspora.  We will have that as part of the debate in this House on the Bill and as part of the campaign.  <\/p><p>Senator Ruane referred to Dublin Pride and the protest.  The Pride event is a form of protest but it is also a day of celebration in recognition of where we have come from.  This year it was fitting that Pride coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, as I said yesterday, and I commend all involved.  Unfortunately, next Saturday I will be away on business concerning the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, but an important march, rally, protest and celebration will take place - the Dublin Trans Pride.  We have a significant journey to travel with our transgender community.  It is important that that we acknowledge Senator Humphreys's tenure as Minister of State in the Department that brought through the landmark legislation.  We have come a long way but we have a journey to go, which is one of the reasons we must continue to be vocal and active on transgender issues and to work with people that require support.  They also require complete healthcare that they are not getting but must battle so hard for.  The Senator made other points about PrEP and others, and HIV.  We will have that debate again in due course.<\/p><p>I join Senator Conway-Walsh in congratulating the appointment of the new American ambassador to this country, Edward Crawford, and wish him well as he begins his tenure.  I thank Reece Smyth for his stewardship in the interregnum when we had no ambassador.  I am sure that Ambassador Crawford will find a huge welcome in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I know from the contribution, record and activity of Senator Conway-Walsh that she will work with others in the House to build relationships with the United States on a variety of issues.  She made a point to welcome the ambassador, which is important.  <\/p><p>On the decision by Ulster Bank to sell off the loans, it is important to recognise a couple of issues.  First, the Government is conscious of the need to protect homeowners.  Second, it has always been a Government priority that the homeowner or mortgage holder would engage and maintain contact and retain his or her full contractual rights regardless of who owns the loan.  Third, it is equally important to recognise that the Government brought in legislation relating to the Consumer Protection Act - the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2018, which has been enacted.<\/p><p>The Senator referred to Deputy Pearse Doherty's Bill.  Independent commentators said that his proposals would be disastrous for the mortgage market, financial stability and have a major negative economic impact.  I cannot say that is correct but that is the commentary of independent observers.

The Minister for Justice and Equality is engaging with the centre and met its representatives last week.  He is willing to explore all legal avenues and solutions in order that there can be a pathway to residency.  Since 2011, 120,000 people have been granted citizenship, including 10,000 last year.  As Senator Boyhan rightly said, our country is enriched by diversity.  I hope that there can be a pathway to residency for the young children who are, because of the illegal status of their parents, confined or caught.  It is important that all avenues be explored.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of rent pressure zones, as did Senator Murnane O'Connor yesterday.  Zones are a legislative matter and is done using a legal criteria.  Senator Lombard made a  point about Carrigaline being divided and that this should be changed given the town's proximity to Cork city, the pressure on housing and the cost of renting.  He made the relevant point that there is no logical divide.<\/p> <p>Senators Swanick, Bacik, Humphreys and Gallagher raised the issue of Alzheimer's disease and I join them in commending the work done by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.

Last week, we had a debate on the summer economic statement.  I will endeavour to have statements before the budget, if we can, as this is an important issue. <\/p> <p>Senator Swanick raised the issue of smoky coal.  Fuel suppliers have threatened legal action who have said they will challenge extending the ban.  The Senator made an important point about the matter.  Equally, the point he made about water safety should be listened to by a wider audience than just here.  Every summer we hear of a tragic drowning or an accident on a farm so we need a more robust campaign on the twin issues of farm safety and water safety and to highlight the need to be safe.  The Senator was correct to raise the issue.  I am happy to talk to him about his Bill and to see how we can progress it as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>Senator Hopkins raised the issue of credit unions and the industry funding levy.

I do not propose to speak at length.  The amendment is an abbreviated and simplified version of the amendment we tabled on Committee Stage.  It would require the Minister for Justice and Equality to review the health and social services available to the Magdalen women under this Act, compare them to the services available to those entitled to a medical card under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 and ensure the participation of the Magdalen women in this review.  We are calling for this review in light of the fact that the first recommendation of the Quirke report, which the Government accepted in full, has not been enacted fully as certain services and therapies accessible to those with a Health Amendment Act, HAA, card have been restricted and are not available to the Magdalen women, despite the fact that Mr. Justice Quirke specifically recommended that the women be entitled to a HAA card standard of care.  It is unfair that these services are not available to these women.  They have gone through enough and should not have to lobby politicians to access what they were promised as part of the State settlement.  I listened closely to what the Minister said in response to our Committee Stage amendment, which was that this is not the place for the amendment, that the Bill is short and technical and that it deals with the extension of health services but, not, apparently, to the ones to which we are referring.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not accept that this is the case.  The 2015 Bill is the legislative enactment of the health and social care recommendations of the Quirke report.  If those recommendations have not been implemented in full, this amendment to the Bill is exactly where such a review should take place.<\/p><p>The Minister claimed the only reason for differences between the entitlements of the Magdalen women and those with an HAA card is that the HAA scheme was specifically designed for those who contracted hepatitis C through contaminated blood products.  Accordingly, some changes were made to adapt the scheme to the needs of the Magdalen women.  He said these changes were \"intended in any way to restrict access, as the focus is firmly on the health needs of the women\".  I absolutely accept the Minister's intentions in this regard and I do not believe the restriction of entitlements is in any way intentional.<\/p><p>Will he provide further clarification that he will examine the entitlements and the restrictions which have, as he said, unintentionally been placed on the Magdalen women?  The practical reality means that, given the way the Magdalen scheme has been designed and implemented, these restrictions unfortunately exist.  It is timely and necessary, therefore, to review the entitlements under both schemes, especially if the intention was never to restrict access.<\/p><p>All we are asking for is a review.  If it is the case that there is nothing wrong and the scheme is operating as intended, will the Minister accept the amendment, conduct a review and show these concerns raised are not founded?  I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#O00300","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.

It is important to acknowledge that the work and the research it carried out on the matter was extremely important.<\/p> <p>We had a relevant incident over the last two years and the current law is that where a body is not recovered, a death certificate cannot be obtained.  One has to wait a period of seven years and that kind of situation happened in the last two years where four people died and bodies were recovered in two cases but not in the other two cases.  It causes its own problems for families.  We have moved on completely to the point of the importance of being able to bring closure.  In these cases, everyone knows the person has died but there was no procedure there to deal with it.  I know there was a provision under the Coroners Act 1962, whereby the Minister for Justice and Equality could write to a coroner and ask him or her to hold an inquest where a body had not been recovered.  In fairness to the former Minister, Frances Fitzgerald MEP, when she was Minister she did that for me in one case.  As a result of a debate here in the Seanad in 2016, a family contacted me and asked me to assist them in bringing closure to them in their family tragedy.  In fairness to the former Minister, she took action.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As this was a drowning, the Garda also took action by taking DNA samples from the family in case the body might have washed up in other jurisdictions.

This approach will be the correct way of dealing with this matter.  It has been up and running in Scotland for more than 40 years.  I thank the Minister again for all the work he did, for making staff available and, indeed, for all of the work they did in making the changes required and working through this Bill with other Government Departments as well.

We are aware, however, that under the global gag rule, for example, we seen an increase in maternal deaths internationally.  Along with steps backwards in technological and medical practices in many parts of the world, we have also seen the restriction of women's rights, medical supports and funding.

The Mercosur agreement reached last Friday was arrived at following 20 years of negotiations.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge just how vital international trade deals are for Ireland.  As a small, open, export-led economy, we very much support balanced international trade.  The key word there is \"balance\".  The Government needs to go through this deal in detail to see if it strikes the right balance for Ireland.  As somebody who lives on a beef farm, I absolutely recognise and appreciate the genuine concerns expressed by our farming community over the Mercosur deal.  The Government hears those concerns and we understand them.<\/p> <p>We need to recognise the positives in this deal for Ireland.  There are significant benefits for Irish exporters in sectors such as business services, chemicals, the drinks industry, machinery, medical devices and the dairy industry with a reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade for these sectors.  In 2018, Ireland exported almost &euro;2 billion worth of goods and services to the Mercosur region.  Trade with the region has grown by almost one fifth in the period from 2010 to 2016.  Against this level of export trade from Ireland to the Mercosur region, we anticipate the EU-Mercosur agreement will allow Irish exporters to expand faster and take advantage of new opportunities.  In this regard, analysis by my Department estimates that a potential doubling of annual goods and services exports from Ireland is possible over the period to 2030.  The deal ensures Irish whiskey and Irish cream liqueur are protected under the EU&rsquo;s geographical indication, GI, scheme.  There are special provisions for SMEs in the agreement.  SMEs benefit most from the simplification of exporting and customs procedures, as the savings accrued are proportionately greater for them.  There are also positives for the dairy sector with tariffs on 45,000 tonnes of product, including cheese, milk powder and infant formula, moving from approximately 19% to zero over a ten-year period, presenting significant opportunities for the sector.  Those are some of the benefits from this deal and it is important to put those on the record here today.<\/p> <p>However, I do not claim that this deal is perfect.  As I said at the outset, I absolutely recognise the concerns of our farmers.  While beef has been in the headlines in recent days, I know there are also very real concerns in the poultry and pig sectors.  Sometimes it is easy to walk into the D&aacute;il or Seanad and criticise the Government and play politics with an issue like this.  I come from a rural community and I have spent all my life on a farm.  The Government fought to achieve the best deal possible for our farmers.<\/p> <p>This is a deal negotiated at EU level.  As a member state, Ireland has raised serious concerns over a long period of time over beef access.  I have raised these concerns at every opportunity at European Trade Council meetings.  I also raised it directly with the trade Commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m.  As recently as 31 May, I again wrote to her highlighting our serious concerns, particularly given the current challenges and uncertainty facing the Irish beef sector in light of Brexit.  There has been a sustained effort across Government on the matter, with both the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Taoiseach also raising it at the highest levels.<\/p> <p>We must remember the South American countries initially sought a beef quota of 300,000 tonnes and the deal on the table offers 99,000 tonnes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While that is still higher than we want it to be, it is important to remember that it is less than a third of what was originally sought.  That reduction is due to the active efforts made by Ireland and other member states.  It is important also to say that 99,000 tonnes will be split into 45% frozen, 55% fresh, and it is carcass weight equivalent, meaning the whole animal and not just prime cuts.<\/p><p>The agreement also ensures there will be equivalent standards.  EU sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, standards will not be relaxed in any way.  They remain non-negotiable.  The highest EU standards will be applied to all imported goods, especially food, so no hormone beef or genetically modified organisms, GMOs, will be allowed.  I want to reassure farmers that equivalent standards are an integral part of this agreement.<\/p><p>In respect of concerns regarding climate change and deforestation, Mercosur, including Brazil, will have to implement fully the Paris climate agreement as part of this deal.  If it does not it is void and the deal falls.  I appreciate when this deal was announced last Friday that it struck fear within the farming community.  It is important, however, to remember this is far from a done deal.  This is an agreement in principle.  It has to go through a legal process which could take up to two years.  It then has to be voted through by a qualified majority on the trade Council.  It also has to go through the European Parliament, where the outcome could be far from certain.  After all that, it is highly likely that more than 40 parliaments, including this House will have their say on it.  It is also important to remember that the quota for beef would be on a phased basis over five years, so we are talking about a deal here today that might not be fully felt until around 2028.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, we are staring down the barrel of a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October which could deliver a serious shock to our economy and which, in particular, would have damaging consequences for the agriculture sector.  In that context, with serious challenges such as Brexit facing us, we need to take a step back here and look at the bigger picture.  That is why my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will now proceed to ensure a comprehensive, independent economic assessment is carried out on Mercosur.  We have the time and space necessary to do that.  The shape Brexit takes and its impact on the agriculture sector will need to be a key consideration of this economic assessment.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach has made it very clear that the Government has an open mind on this deal.  As I have outlined, there are benefits in certain sectors but there are also negatives and we need to determine overall if this is going to be a win or a lose for our economy.  We should not lose sight of the fact that in recent years we have had EU trade agreements with Japan, Vietnam, Singapore and Mexico which are very positive for our agriculture sector and which, in particular, provide for the export of 105,000 tonnes of European beef.  Those were good trade deals for our agriculture sector.  Mercosur is a difficult one.  I accept that.  What we have to do now as a Government is look at this deal in the round.  That is what the economic assessment will do and it will ensure that the Government makes a fully informed decision when deciding what position to take when the ratification process on this deal commences in two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#CC00300","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I think it was Mick Doyle, a famous Irish rugby player, coach and pundit, who coined the phrase &quot;get your retaliation in early&quot;.  I am intrigued to see that the Minister has taken that up today in her opening statement by criticising Opposition Members for playing politics.  I for one have no intention of playing politics or going for headlines, punchlines or soundbites on an issue that is so important to rural Ireland, not just the agriculture sector or the beef-producing sector but rural Ireland in general.  I am a beef farmer so I know what I am talking about in that regard and would never play politics with something so important to a sector that is already on its knees, and has been for several years.  Pre-Brexit, the beef sector in this country was in crisis.  Brexit has added a hammer blow to that crisis and, irrespective of what the Minister says about its timelines, this almost ratified deal seems to me and other farmers to be a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  Even if it is 2028 before we see the consequences for Irish farms, for the meat industry and the beef sector, which are price takers and are almost totally dependent on an export market and on a factory system that we all know has problems, the scaremongering has started.<\/p><p>Like Brexit for the past two and a half to three years, the Mercosur deal will be used and has been used as a scaremongering tactic on price fixing.  Irish beef farmers started feeling the consequences of this proposal the morning after it was announced and the Minister cannot tell me anything different, such is the nature of the industry.  The Minister rightly says, and I am not playing politics because we are almost singing off the same hymn sheet on this issue, that the Government, to judge by commentary in recent days, is opposed to this.  I am aggrieved at the Government's progress in officially opposing it and having any effect on the outcome.  The Minister says, to make it sound good, that the initial proposal from the South American side was for 300,000 tonnes and is almost praising herself for getting that down to 99,000 tonnes.  In 2017, the Government was opposing 70,000 tonnes.  Its brilliant negotiating skills to reduce that 70,000 tonnes has resulted in 99,000 tonnes.<\/p><p>While the Minister says the deal will be bound by equivalence and the Paris Agreement on climate change, there does not seem to be, from my reading of it, and I have not read the entire document, which is extensive, any guarantee that the Paris Agreement on climate change or equivalence in the standard of traceability and production imposed on us by the European Commission will have to be met by the South American countries.  Their carbon footprint for beef production is four times that of ours.  We hear daily when we discuss climate action and climate change the proposal bandied about by most people to reduce our herd and increase our afforestation on the land that would then be freed up.  However, an area the size of Croke Park is turned every minute from rainforest in Brazil to beef production land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#DD00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#DD00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>That is the 99,000 tonnes we will take, on top of the 270,000 tonnes we take already with tariff, because it is produced cheaply due to the methods.  The tariff is paid but the beef remains more competitively priced than Irish and European beef.  There is never a good time for a bad story or bad news for any sector.  We export 90% of our beef and in turn 90% of that goes to the UK.  If there is to be a hard Brexit, as the Minister mentioned, and we lose that UK market, a big part of that beef will have to go to continental Europe.  We have been trying to find markets in continental Europe.  When the damage caused by Brexit is combined with this Mercosur deal, it will increase what is already 102% self-sufficiency in beef in Europe to 116%.  That is based on the European Commission's report on the cumulative economic impact of future trade agreements on EU agriculture, which estimates that the European beef trade will take a hit of &euro;5 billion and a price drop of 16%.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It has been suggested that a &euro;1 billion package will be offered to farmers for the disturbance of their markets.

I emphasise that she should continue to argue that a new report that takes Brexit into consideration should be compiled.  There are now 27 European countries in this deal.  When it was initiated, there were 28 countries.  It is most likely that as we go forward, there will be just 27 countries.  We are losing one of the stronger economies that would have been factored into the initial negotiations.<\/p><p>The Minister spoke about how the deal will be finally ratified.  She concluded by saying it is \"highly likely\" that it will have to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is not very reassuring to me, to anybody else in here or, in particular, to the Irish beef farmers who are watching this debate.  That is a sell-out.  The deal is either going to have to be passed by these Houses or it is not.  There is no veto.  I can say here and now that if the Upper and Lower Houses do not get an opportunity to pass or refuse to pass this deal, it is a sell-out.  The words \"highly likely\" are not very reassuring.  We need this to be clarified immediately.<\/p><p>I have mentioned climate action with regard to Irish beef farmers.  The Minister spoke about the importance of this deal for SMEs.  There are positives.  I support trade deals that break down trade barriers and help to increase employment and exports.  We cannot have a loss in one sector, as this deal will entail, to support other sectors.  During this crash, SMEs in rural Ireland were kept going by the farming sector.  Now that we have turned the corner, we seem to be turning our back on the agricultural sector at every opportunity.  This is a particular problem in those parts of rural Ireland that are most in need of job creation and employment support.  The SMEs that live off farming communities are those most in need of our support.  We cannot sell them out for other SMEs that may or may not be able to tender for export opportunities to South America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#DD00400","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>This debate will conclude at 4 p.m.  Many Senators are seeking to contribute.

We trade right across the world.<\/p> <p>There is a danger that South American countries will drift towards American control and Trumpian ideas.  That was evident during last year's elections in Brazil.  All of this poses a danger to the Paris accord.<\/p> <p>The positive aspects of this deal should be recognised.  The agreement includes an obligation to implement the international organisation of fundamental standards and freedom of associations.  It recognises the right of collective bargaining, which we have campaigned for in this country for many years and has recently been recognised in law here.  The deal recognises freedom of association.  All of these are key elements within the deal.  It is important to raise workers' standards across South America.  Anyone who understands the history of what has been happening in South America will see the fundamental importance of these matters.<\/p> <p>The Paris accord on climate change will not be implemented and regulated by blue helmets.  We are not going to be able to send the UN into Brazil to protect the rain forest.  We have to ensure it is controlled by international agreements, including trade agreements.  I would love to see blue helmets implementing the Paris accord, but that is not going to happen.  It is going to be implemented and regulated by bureaucrats.  Satellite photographs will be used to make sure agreements that are made on an international basis are enforced.  Draft trade agreements include ways and mechanisms to enforce the Paris accord.  That has to be recognised.  There is agreement on the restoration and reforestation of 12 million ha of forest.  That is important because America and Trump have reneged on the Paris accord.  We are tying several important South American countries into the Paris accord under an international trade agreement.  The agreement will fall if they do not meet these obligations.<\/p> <p>The World Health Organization has continually flagged the use of antibiotics in certain sectors of agriculture, including the beef, poultry and pigmeat sectors.  Antibiotics can work their way into the human food chain.  We need to be honest about the fact that the regulations in South America are weak.<\/p> <p>I emphasise that this is only a draft agreement.  We will get the proof of this agreement when we get the detail right and make sure climate change is stitched into it.  These countries must recognise that.  At all stages over recent weeks and months, everybody has been speaking about the importance of climate change.  Practical steps are needed to tie countries into the process.  It is a question of the carrot and the stick.  We can engage in fair trade and open our markets, but if the regulations are not met we can close those markets again.<\/p> <p>It is worth noting that the deal states that food safety standards are absolutely not for negotiation.  A 100% level of compliance with EU food safety standards will have to be achieved.  The deal makes it clear that EU food safety standards are non-negotiable and will be applied rigorously.  It is worth noting that the deal states that the EU Food and Veterinary Office, which is based in County Meath, will be the authority that ensures this happens.<\/p> <p>We can go with the soundbites I have been listening to since the weekend, or we can sit down and start looking at the agreement in detail.  We can selfishly look at how this deal affects Ireland, or we can start looking at our climate and our planet as a whole.  If we want to tackle climate change, we must encourage other countries that have difficulties in coming along with the climate effort.  Some of that will involve doing trade deals.  We have to accept that such deals will not always go in our favour.  As a First World country, Ireland is part of the problem.  We have to help Third World countries to meet certain standards.  That will be done through fair trade deals.<\/p> <p>I hope and pray that the Government will take care when the detail of this agreement is being finalised.  I hope we will protect our environment and workers' rights and assist domestic industries, such as the beef industry, where such assistance is needed.  We need to make sure it receives as much help as possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have a broader obligation to humanity but that has fallen at the first hurdle.  Before the local and European elections were held, every party and the Government said, \"Oh, my God.  The green issue is the issue for the future\".  I have been saying for three years that a price must be paid to get our climate right and these prices must be paid over the coming months, years and decades.  We have to get fair trade correct and must assist Third World countries.  We have to protect our own industries as much as possible but above all, we have a responsibility to humanity and to the planet.  I am sorry to say that too often, over the past three or four days, I have heard sound bites taken straight out of the IFA's handbook.  We must get beyond interest groups and think of the bigger picture.  We have to ensure that we protect the rainforests.  We have to ensure that any international agreements are enforced, which is key if we want to stop the deforestation of the rainforests.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#EE01000","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>\"Disappointment\", \"betrayal\", \"catastrophic\", \"reckless\", \"irresponsible\" and \"devastating\".  These are not my words but all of them have been used in the press by journalists and farm lobby groups to describe the deal in the last number of days.  We should not be surprised because the deal has the potential to cripple the industry here.<\/p> <p>In a former life, I was the president of the Ulster Farmers' Union.  Nearly four years ago we were acutely aware of Mercosur and the risks it presented.  In fact, the deal has been on the table for nearly 20 years.  We were always fearful that agriculture and food would be used as trading or bargaining chips in a deal.  We warned people about the impact the deal could have, the potential damage and the devastating effect it could have on the meat industry and, lo and behold, it has happened.  The risks presented by the deal four years ago are exactly the same now.<\/p> <p>First, granting access to the European market for 99,000 tonnes of product at a reduced tariff is still a major concern albeit a reduction from the initial figure of 300,000 tonnes.  A beef industry under immense pressure on a number of fronts cannot take any more burdens.  There is no question that the deal will ultimately impact on the European market where cheaper product, sourced in South America, will depress the market.  The deal will curtail any improvement in prices.  Most important, the deal will leave our farmers and producers at a distinct disadvantage.  Products will be imported into Europe without the assurances and guarantees that we currently demand from our own farmers.  The products sourced in regions will not be bound by the environmental protections and regulations that we have observe.  Products will be sourced from places where no minimum wage exists, where workers' rights are not protected and where the costs of production are stripped back to the bare minimum.  In reality, when products reach these shores they will be judged as being of equal standing as Irish beef, which they definitely will not.  Will discerning consumers differentiate or identify different production methods?  Will they be willing to pay more for Irish beef?  Will they question the validity of cheaper food?  I think not.  In fact, I know they will not because many consumers cannot afford to do so.  Anyone who struggles to get their weekly spend on food and provisions down may welcome cheaper food but what is the real cost of doing so?<\/p> <p>On this island we have world-leading standards for traceability, animal welfare, food safety and environmental protections, which address all of the concerns consumers may have regarding where their food comes from and how it is produced.  This deal presents a double standards policy and completely discriminates against our own farmers and producers.  However, it must be stated that the deal is not bad for all sectors, as the Minister has indicated.  The dairy sector is set to gain and possibly capitalise on opportunities.  The Minister highlighted the examples of cream liqueurs, cheese, milk powder and infant formula.  I have no doubt that many other sectors of trade and industry will benefit from the Mercosur deal.  The European car industry and many others have openly welcomed the deal but that is of little consolation or comfort to anyone in the Irish beef industry.  Where do we go from here?  What are the solutions?  How will we deal with this matter?  The industry must be given solutions to these problems within the deal.  The deal has been agreed in principle but the end deal will probably look quite similar to what we have in front of us.<\/p> <p>Standards of food production on imported goods must be identified with robust monitoring and examples of malpractice highlighted as was the case in the audit reports performed by the EU Commission in 2013 and 2017, respectively.  The reports clearly identified that Mercosur countries were not complying with the EU's strict sanitary standards or food safety standards.  Furthermore, as regards sustainability, it is imperative that the Mercosur countries are held to account with binding commitments to the Paris climate agreement, under which Brazil has committed to end illegal deforestation by 2030 and restore and reforest 12 million hectares of forest, of which we have seen very little evidence. <\/p> <p>In addition, we must consider mechanisms to ensure viable businesses remain viable.  We must also avoid land abandonment, which could become a reality if margins are further eroded in beef production.  We must ensure that assistance to underpin sustainability and profitability is implemented.  Additionally, we must educate consumers to question food sourcing and integrity, and to place food procurement at a much higher priority in their value set.  Consumers must get all the facts and information to make informed decisions when they purchase.  <\/p> <p>This week has not been a good one for Irish beef producers and many people have likened the deal to the boy who cried wolf.  I urge people to be under no illusion because the wolf is at our door and the threat is real.  The deal has created another layer of uncertainty in an industry facing unheralded pressure from a lack of profitability and environmental concerns, veganism, vegetarianism and alternative proteins, and draws into question its sustainability and future.  The one thing that is for sure is that if we do not protect this industry then we will lose it.<\/p> <p>As has been demonstrated by a number of scientists and academics, livestock production and beef production will be critical components in maintaining a healthy environment and rural landscape, to return nutrients to the soil, to maintain pastures and uplands and will be a vital player in the business of carbon management.  The ideology of a world of vegans and vegetarians that is devoid of livestock but planted with fruit and vegetables has been proven to be unsustainable.  Livestock production and beef production will be part of the mix for a healthy planet.<\/p> <p>In conclusion, we must deal with uncertainty and give clarity.  We must support sustainability and ensure margins.  We have a deal and two years of a legal process before us.  Therefore, we must engage immediately to protect those who will be the most affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#FF00200","speaker":"1439"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the Order of Business today, I propose that we extend this debate and conclude at 4.15 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#FF00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We have forced farmers into a market where the meat factories, supermarkets and corporations dictate the farming model.  Farmers have been forced away from practices that were traditionally organic and environmentally sustainable to an intensive farming model that feeds a corporation-driven food policy.

However, it still has to be turned into a legal document.  This process will take approximately two years and then it will be brought to the Council of Ministers for a vote.  Ireland does not have a veto because voting is done on a qualified majority and not unanimously, but these changes came in as a consequence of the Nice and Lisbon treaties.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposed these treaties, warning at the time of the dangers to agriculture.  Other countries such as Belgium, France and Poland have spoken out against the agreement.  To stop it, Ireland would need them and others to vote against the agreement.  If the deal was passed by the Council of Ministers, it would then go to the European Parliament for ratification.  There is a debate over whether it is a so-called mixed agreement, and therefore needs ratification by the Parliaments of all member states, or whether it can simply be decided upon by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The Government must act to get clarification on all these matters - we really need to know this information - and then act accordingly.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in came in for criticism during the recent European Parliament elections for opposing every treaty.

There are many aspects of it, affecting many parts of our community, not just rural Ireland and the beef sector but other parts of the rural economy such as the dairy sector.  Of course we should be concerned about our beef producers and should protect them.  We need time to examine this deal to see how we can mitigate the impact of 99,000 tonnes more beef coming into the EU market, which we sell into.  However, we also have to look at the positive impact it will have on the drinks industry, machinery and medical devices, an area in which we are a world leader.<\/p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn talks of a sell-out, but there was no sell-out here whatever.  While we might consider the rainforests ours, the people of Brazil might have a very different attitude, as we might if they called the bogs in Ireland \"our bogs\".  The best way to influence people is to negotiate, have a relationship and trade with them, not to ignore them.  <\/p> <p>There is much in this deal that can be good and many thousands of jobs can flow from it, but there are dangers too.  The Minister highlighted those dangers clearly, as somebody who lives in rural Ireland and grew up on a beef farm.  I grew up on a farm in north County Dublin and there are 800 farmers in my constituency.  I am concerned for their welfare but I am also concerned about the climate and am committed to our climate change protocol.  I want to see it protected for our own well-being and for the future of our children, their children and their children's children.  However, we will not do that by refusing to deal with those who are in control of large tranches of our earth, where the lows of the world exist.  Our best chance of influencing them is to try to bring them around to our way of thinking and up to our standards.  This deal makes it very clear that there will be no dilution of standards in beef production.  <\/p> <p>The EU cannot go backwards and this is a deal for both sides.  It is worthy of proper and full examination.  We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as some here intend for us to do, before we have even seen what the deal really means.  There is much time left to examine this.  If it transpires that this Government or the next - there could be an election between now and then - deem it inappropriate for us to pursue this deal, I have no doubt that we will oppose it.

I know from working with her in the constituency of her concern for the welfare of farmers.  I acknowledge, as did my colleague, the potential benefits of the deal.  However, I wish to focus on the potential pitfalls.  At present, beef farmers are experiencing dreadful conditions.  I find it strange that store cattle are making a very good price, and perhaps my colleagues who are beef farming will tell me about it.  The problem is at the fattening stage.<\/p> <p>The Minister stated there will be equivalence of standards and the Government would want to ensure that is the case, but how does one control the quality of meat so that we do not get imports of hormone beef?  The departure of the UK from the European Union could help us in that there would be a greater imperative for the UK to get cheaper beef because of the demography of its population.  How the import of beef will be vetted is a major issue.  We would need alternative markets to meet the market that will be displaced from the import of 99,000 tonnes of beef under the Mercosur agreement.  If as Senator Marshall said it will represent a 16% reduction of farmer incomes, we would have to compensate our farmers directly to make up that loss of 16% of income.  We would have to do that.<\/p> <p>If the economic analysis were to throw up a situation where overall Ireland benefits from this, then we have to focus on our beef farmers and support them in two ways through this.  We would have to make direct payment support and open up new markets.  I know that some new markets have been opened up in recent times.  There would have to be measures to ensure equivalent, hormone-free quality beef.<\/p> <p>Coming from Cavan, I wish to stress the importance of the pig and poultry sectors.  Farms in counties Cavan and Monaghan are not specifically beef or dairy, as they might be in the south.  The small farms in Cavan will rear store cattle, and have a small dairy herd and both need protection.<\/p> <p>My point is that we to protect our farmers through this process.  There can be no diminution of their income, as the income of the small farmers and those engaged in mixed farming is not there and we need to save them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#HH00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins is sharing her time with Senator Norris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#HH00300","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am taking six minutes and Senator Norris must be satisfied with two minutes.<\/p> <p>I have previously spoken in the House on the CETA trade agreement and other trade agreements.  It is important that we are really clear that when we speak about trade it is not a simple matter of those who are pro-trade and those who are anti-trade, those who are protectionist and those who are open.  It is and must always be about what is the best quality of trade deal, the kind of trade that will be constructive and positive and deliver for the citizens that we represent as politicians as well as for corporate interests and that is why we need to review and examine trade policies and strategies on a regular basis.  That is a fundamental point.  Concerns have been raised about regulations around the investment court system and other trade agreement.  We need to think carefully about the ratification of the last part of the CETA agreement because of the investment courts and the chill we have seen from legal challenge, for example the legal challenge that the coal industry sought to bring against the introduction of smokeless coal.  We are at a moment now when we need a new kind of trade policy and a new trade mandate.<\/p> <p>It has been mentioned frequently that the Mercosur agreement has been 20 years in the making and they have been negotiating for 20 years.  Some of that is evident in that much of the proposal is dated.  Twenty years is not something one must accept, but it must be noted that much has changed in the world in that period.  It was mentioned that we may be looking at 27 countries in the European Union rather than 28 but that we are also looking not just at the Paris Agreement but the climate crisis which has necessitated the Paris Agreement.  The Paris Agreement is not the end, there will be further agreements as the climate crisis intensifies.  There will be further standards that need to be added in terms of biodiversity.  Similarly, the sustainable development goals are an internationally agreed blueprint for what sustainable development should look like.  Surely the trade we have globally between countries is part of the picture for sustainable development.  It concerns me that I have seen no reference to the sustainable development goals and the 2030 agenda anywhere in respect of the discussion on this agreement.  If we have an agreed idea of what it means to develop in a sustainable way, environmentally, socially and inclusively, that should be reflected in the trade deals that we mark down for the future.<\/p> <p>The concerns of the beef industry have been raised but there are many industries in other areas that are of concern.  I note that Irish whiskey and Irish cream liqueur were mentioned quite a lot.  It speaks to the fact that the alcohol lobby are very strong but there are more than 320 exceptions.  Are those the only two?  What other exemptions are there?  What about future produce, such as the seaweed production which is now becoming an industry?  What protections have we for the development of high quality produce, which is an area that we have urging farmers to move into as they may move away from beef production for other reasons in the future?  One cannot overlook the fact that President Bolsonaro in his first hundred days legalised 150 new forms of pesticide.  Let us consider that in terms of the impact on biodiversity in what is the treasure box of the world, the rainforests.  Senator Reilly, I note that the rainforest is of global interest and our bogs are of global interest.  When one looks at the incursions into indigenous lands and the dismantling of environmental protections under Bolsonaro, these are very serious issues; simply requiring a planting of trees does not replace the rich biodiversity of the rainforest, which cannot be replaced by commercial planting here or anywhere else.  It is about the millennia of development.<\/p> <p>In terms of pharmaceuticals that were mentioned, of course the treasure chest for pharmaceuticals is the rainforest.  That is where so many of the medications which have saved lives around the world have come from.<\/p> <p>There is a duty on the European Union to ensure that human rights are protected.  We have very serious human rights violations, including for the LGBT community and others that we are seeing in Brazil.  Today, I met advocates who talked about the blood coal from Colombia, the fact that Moneypoint is using 90% of coal sourced from Colombia, in spite of massive human rights issues.  Again we had the EU Colombia Peru trade deal.  We were assured at the time that human rights concerns would always be addressed, yet it seems that advocates have to travel the world looking for justice and not getting it, because of the inadequacy.  These are measures that must be addressed.<\/p> <p>The Minister has mentioned having an open mind about the process.  An open mind is not enough, we need action.  We need an active strategy.  We do not want the Irish Government watching with interest and an open mind.  We need a new strategy, active engagement and we need to know very vitally that it is not enough to say that it is highly likely that we may get to discuss it.  We need a guarantee from the Government that it will go to both Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss it and we will oppose if the European Commission seeks to challenge our right for ratification on this.  We know the European Commission has sought to avoid it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are very practical measures.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#HH00400","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#JJ00200","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I will conclude and pass to my colleague.

I am not just concerned with the beef.<\/p> <p>I am concerned for the planet.  That is why I used bad language on the Order of Business.  I did want to get a soundbite.  I wanted to get something out there and to get the people of Ireland to wake up to what is happening on this planet.  I have been in the Amazon basin and seen the deforestation.  I have heard the chainsaws working and seen the enormous clouds of smoke over the forest.  It is appalling what is going on there.  People are not speaking out against that.  Regarding what was said about reforestation, that is a complete load of nonsense.  The rain forest is a naturally-occurring wilderness in which all kinds of diversity occurs.  It is not possible to replicate that diversity with replanting.  That is complete and utter nonsense as well.<\/p> <p>The Minister stated that she has heard and understood the concerns expressed.

As others have stated, this deal, if passed by the European Council and Parliament, has the potential to decimate the Irish beef market.  I listened to Mr. Phil Hogan, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, on the radio on Saturday morning.  He spoke about a &euro;1 billion displacement fund having been secured as part of this deal.  What farmers really want, however, is a fair price for their produce.  They do not want displacement funds.  They produce beef to the highest possible standards and they want a fair price for that produce.  As the Minister stated, this is not a completed deal.  We need to ensure that EU beef markets are protected, not just in Ireland but in other European countries.<\/p> <p>As other Senators have said, Ireland's predominantly grass-based beef production is one of the most carbon efficient in the world while Brazil removes vast amounts of rain forest each year to enable extra beef production.  This point must also be recognised, as others have stated.  Our farmers, along with other European farmers, must be supported accordingly.  The Minister has stated that the Government will be looking at this deal in detail.  It is important that we ensure better outcomes for farmers, meet the challenges of climate change and protect the integrity of the EU food market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#JJ00800","speaker":"1415"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I welcome this important debate.  I would also like to have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, in the House but I respect all that the Minister has had to say on this issue.  Much of this debate has been pretty surreal or has oscillated between reality and unreality.  Trade is really important.  We are a small, open economy and we like to reward enterprise.  We also see the benefits of people doing so.  There is no objection to that in principle.  Let us be very clear, however, that our beef farmers are being asked to take one for the team.  This deal boils down to that.<\/p> <p>The European Union, which I will call the western world, is dressing up this deal with a smattering of icing around the Paris Agreement.  It is being claimed that this is really going to bring these South American countries into line and all of the developing countries that cannot possibly go in the direction in which we need them to go.  The other unreality is a failure to recognise our position on the planet.  That is absolutely fantastic and I will not take from that.  Let us compare the position and size of our country with the size and position of those South American countries.  Ultimately, we do not need any more beef coming into the European market.  Our farmers are already demoralised.  If they were not demoralised before, they will be now when they see what is before them.  Why is the beef from South America cheaper?  It is not of the same standard.  What about the 270,000 tonnes already coming in?  We are now faced with the prospect of those imports having the same reduced tariff as the 99,000 tonnes to come.  <\/p> <p>Our farmers are increasingly being edged out.  I agree with Senator Hopkins that we do not want a &euro;1 billion rescue package on the premise that we are going to have all of this increased trade, whether in pharmaceuticals, this, that or the other.  I have the height of respect for the foreign direct investment industries operating here.  We are in danger, however, of putting all of our eggs in one basket and forgetting that the champion and leading light in our economic recovery was our agriculture and agrifood sector.  Some 170,000 people are employed in that sector.  I know that not all of those people are working in the beef sector.  We are, however, losing the run of ourselves a bit.  <\/p> <p>Regarding standards, previous speakers have referred to traceability and the use of antibiotics and hormones.  We set up the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and we have rules and regulations for everything to do with farming.  We are now stating that that does not really matter because we will take in beef from somewhere else as long as a few boxes are ticked.  I do not believe that we are going to be in South America monitoring carbon emissions and standards in any way comparable to what happens here.  Farms and farm families have to deal with that real burden.  When we get down to the essentials of this deal, we are talking about farms and farm families.  The way that this is proceeding means that we are talking about changing the face of rural Ireland.  The farmers have to be protected.  That is what I believe.  <\/p> <p>I would like to see not just an economic assessment of the impact of this deal but also an assessment of the carbon emissions, and that has to be based on reality.  I have a question I asked here earlier for the Minister on this area.  Are all of the cars that are going to be sold to South America going to be electric vehicles or will they be diesel and petrol?  Do we have details concerning that aspect of the deal?  Is it the case that the manufacturers will be able to dump all of the vehicles that they cannot sell in Europe in South America?  That will show the hypocrisy and double speak of the green agenda and the western world.  I subscribe to the idea of sustainability.  On a somewhat related matter, however, we can see that cobalt is required for electric vehicles.  Where does that come from?  It comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo where children aged seven, eight or nine years old are down mines all hours of the day.  Is that where we are going to be buying cobalt from?  We are going to crucify our farmers on the back of a green dream that is totally unreal and does not face up to the reality with which human beings are dealing.  In this case, I am referring in particular to farmers and farming communities.  I ask everyone to please wake up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#JJ00900","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>If the Minister wishes to respond she has until 4.15 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#JJ01000","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Senators for their contributions on the Mercosur trade agreement.

I come from a farming community so I fully appreciate and understand the genuine concerns that have been expressed by farmers.  I have acknowledged that the agreement does not deliver all that the Government may have wanted.<\/p><p>I assure Senators that the Government fought hard to achieve the best deal.  I availed of every single opportunity at EU level to raise our concerns, especially in respect of the beef sector.  Senators have no need to doubt that I availed of every chance to mention our concerns.  I will continue to work to ensure that the concerns raised by farmers are addressed.  Other member states had similar concerns to Ireland about the beef sector.  In the period ahead we need to consider ways to work with those parties to see if we can diminish the impact on the agricultural sector.  I assure Senators that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I will explore all avenues in this regard.  There is still a long way to go with this deal and we should not lose sight of the fact that Brexit is a much greater and more immediate challenge facing our agricultural sector.  <\/p><p>Naturally, the focus of many Senators is on agriculture but it is important that we recognise the benefits that Ireland will accrue from the deal.  There will be opportunities for our SMEs in particular with the opening up of the public procurement sector in Mercosur.  This deal will also benefit the dairy industry, business services, the chemical sector and the drinks industry as tariffs are significantly reduced and barriers to trade are lessened.<\/p><p>Ireland exports &euro;2 billion worth of goods, services and trade and the EU-Mercosur agreement should allow us to grow exports further and faster.  The deal was only agreed in principle on Friday last and it must go through a number of different stages before it comes into force.  It will take up to two years for the agreement to go through a legal scrubbing process.  I recall that the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, is a comprehensive document of more than 2,500 pages with 500 pages of legal text and detailed text on each tariff line included as part of the deal.  That shows that the final agreement will take a considerable time to be completed.  In the meantime we will continue to assess the impact of the deal as more detailed information comes to hand.  <\/p><p>Regadring the climate impact, the agreement includes a detailed chapter on sustainable development goals, SDGs.  It recognises the need to address the urgent threat of climate change and the role that trade has played as well as underscoring the importance of both parties implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement.  The Paris Agreement includes, for example, a pledge by Brazil to reduce, by 2025, its net greenhouse gas emissions by 37% compared with the 2005 levels, a pledge to stop illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon basin by 2030 and to reforest 12 million ha, and a pledge by the EU to reduce its domestic emissions by at least 40% by 2030.  There is also a role for NGOs in the oversight of adherence to the deal.<\/p><p>The issue of geographic indicators was raised.  We can only protect geographic indicators that exist.  We have two protected products on the list - Irish whiskey and Irish cream liqueur.  I do not have the full list of 300 products to hand but there is one available and they have all been decided.  Products are protected, particularly products that come from certain areas.<\/p><p>The ratification process has been raised.  As far as Mercusor is concerned, we understand from the Commission that it will be an association agreement.  That means that for the full agreement to come into effect, individual member state ratification procedures are likely to be necessary, including approval by the Oireachtas.  We will only be sure of that when we see the text.  I am taking it that Oireachtas approval will be legally necessary.  I cannot give a commitment on that until we see the text but I hope that will be the case.<\/p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will work to ensure that a detailed, independent economic assessment is carried out to examine the full impact of the agreement on our economy as a whole, including the environmental impact and specifically the impact on the beef sector and the challenges it faces regarding Brexit.  We have the time and space to do so.  I believe that this is the sensible thing to do before determining the Government's position on the deal.  We have time to conduct a detailed examination of the deal and carry out any necessary assessments.  <\/p><p>I thank the Senators for their time and their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#JJ01100","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for extending her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#KK00200","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Will the Minister respond to my question on German cars?

It has a single straightforward purpose - to give effect to the announcement made in the Budget Statement 2019 to establish a new scheme of jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed from November of this year.<\/p> <p>This new scheme will provide a social insurance support to self-employed contributors who lose their businesses and will provide them with the support and breathing space they need to reassess their next steps.  The Bill is very much in keeping with this Government's policy of supporting self-employed people and entrepreneurs<\/p> <p>The new benefit we are introducing reflects the Government&rsquo;s aim of creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurship, including providing an income safety net to employees and self-employed alike.  This Government has sought to encourage enterprise and, in particular, has sought to introduce a new deal for the self-employed when it comes to accessing their benefits.<\/p> <p>Senators will recall that we extended treatment benefits and invalidity pension to the self-employed in recent years to ensure that they reach some parity with employees in the benefits they can access from the social insurance contributions.  The introduction of a new jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme for the self-employed represents the next step in the Government&rsquo;s work to extend PRSI benefits and will provide an income safety net to thousands of small and medium businesses throughout the country.  For the first time, this gives the self-employed access to the safety net of income supports if they lose their self-employment, without having to go through the rigours of a means test. <\/p> <p>Many of the features of the existing jobseeker's benefit scheme, which provides support to employees who have lost their jobs, will apply to this new scheme.  For example, the personal rate of payment of &euro;203 per week will be the same for both schemes.  The duration of payment, for six months or nine months depending on the claimant&rsquo;s social insurance record, will also be the same.  The scheme has been designed to take into account the fact that PRSI contributions by the self-employed are paid by way of an annual lump sum.<\/p> <p>The activation of self-employed workers who have had to close their businesses, and their re-engagement into employment, whether that is again in self-employment or as an employee, will be a priority in my Department.  We are currently examining the activation supports available for this cohort, but in any event, claimants of the new payment will have access to the full range of activation supports currently available to all other jobseekers.  This includes, for instance, referral to group information sessions, one to one interviews and subsequent caseworker support.<\/p> <p>Self-employed people who are operating businesses at low levels of income can continue to access the means tested jobseeker's allowance scheme.  There are almost 7,000 self-employed in receipt of this payment as of today.<\/p> <p>I would now like to briefly outline the contents of the Bill, which contains nine sections in three Parts.  Part 1 comprises section 1, which provides for the standard provisions setting out the Short Title of the Bill, its construction and citations, and commencement provisions.<\/p> <p>Part 2 deals with amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Section 2 is again a standard provision which defines the principal Act used in this Part.<\/p> <p>One of the consequences of introducing the new scheme is that it is necessary also to amend some of the provisions of the Act governing the existing jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme.  These changes are provided for in sections 3 and 4.  Section 3 extends the qualifying conditions for the existing jobseeker's benefit scheme by providing that the first condition to determine eligibility for payment can now be met by having 104 employment or optional contributions, for example PRSI class A contributions, as has always been the case, or by having have 156 self-employment contributions PRSI class S, which is being added.  This positive change recognises that some people will have engaged in both employment and self-employment in their working lives.  By recognising that either form of employment gives rise to entitlements within the social insurance system, this change will help to ensure that an individual will not be at a disadvantage as a result of a move from employment to self-employment.<\/p> <p>Section 4 provides that where a claimant who is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, self-employed, also satisfies the qualifying conditions for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, periods spent in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, self-employed, will be treated as though jobseeker's benefit is being paid.  This is a standard provision to ensure that a claimant does not secure a double benefit.<\/p> <p>Section 5 is the key element of the Bill and provides for the introduction of a new Chapter 12A to the principal Act, which sets out all of the provisions governing the new jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, self-employed, scheme. <\/p> <p>The new Chapter 12A provides for the general qualifying conditions for receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, self-employed, the social insurance contribution conditions, the rate of benefit payable, including reduced rate benefits payable where the average reckonable weekly earnings of the claimant fall below certain thresholds, the increases payable where there is a qualified adult or qualified children, the duration of payment, and the requirement to engage with activation services and disqualifications.  These provisions mirror, to a great extent, the existing provisions governing entitlement to jobseeker's benefit.  I do not propose to go through the detail of all of these aspects at this time, but we will have an opportunity to examine these in greater depth on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#MM00700","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562146200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Section 6provides for a range of amendments to the general provisions of the Act which cover all social insurance schemes and are required to reflect the introduction of the new jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, self-employed, scheme.

As Senators will know, the people about whom we are talking are, in very many cases, engaged in small family-run businesses.  During the recession everyone took a hit, but I particularly remember how small businesses suffered.  Almost overnight, there were fewer vans on the road; many office units shut down and small businesses such as mobile hairdressers literally went out of business overnight.  Now that the economy is starting to hum again, it is positive that we are seeing more and more vans on the road, not that we welcome the queues for breakfast rolls, but it is good to see them on the road, fewer empty office units and more shops with entrepreneurs taking a chance.  That is a great indicator of our national spirit and culture and the recovery is starting to bed in.  We talk a lot about multinational companies locating in Ireland and the welcome jobs they bring to all counties, but the backbone in creating employment is small and medium-sized enterprises which, in the main, are started by Irish entrepreneurs.  By providing for greater fairness and support for these job creators, we can continue to build the best possible environment for growth and prosperity for all citizens. \r\n\r\nI hope to be in a position to introduce a small but important amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage.  It relates to a separate matter from that covered in the Bill.  It concerns the procedures governing appeals in relation to social welfare payments against decisions of deciding officers appointed as bureau officers under section 8 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996.  In practical terms, the purpose of the amendment will be to provide that such appeals will always have to be submitted to the Circuit Court.  The amendment is being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and we will have an opportunity to deal with it in greater detail on Committee Stage.\r\n\r\nI know that I can expect to hear valuable contributions from Senators.

I hope they have a lovely day.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection for introducing this Bill in this House.  As a small business owner since 2006 and as a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator I am very happy to support this Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for the introduction of a new social insurance scheme, jobseeker's benefit, which will be payable as the Minister said, to individuals who lose their self employment and have the required number of PRSI contributions to qualify for the payment.  <\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently supported extending on a phased and on a voluntary basis a full range of social protection supports to self-employed PRSI contributors as part of our commitment to foster an entrepreneurial culture as well as enhancing social solidarity.  As part of the arrangement to facilitate the formation of a minority Government, Fianna F&aacute;il extracted policy commitments under the confidence and supply arrangement to support entrepreneurs and the self-employed.  Fianna Fail therefore supports this Bill and the creation of a social welfare safety net for the self-employed.  However it is imperative that the Government ensures the legislation is enacted as soon as feasible and efforts continue to remove the systematic discrimination against the self-employed.  As the Minister stated, small businesses and self-employed people are the backbone of our economy.  There are currently nearly 250,000 small and medium sized businesses in this country, which account for more than 99% of all actual businesses, according to the CSO.  Many hurdles are faced on a daily basis by job creators who keep delivering for their communities.  The self-employed pay higher income tax and PRSI rates than those they employ while up until this point there has been no equivalent social protection support if the business failed.  This treatment has crippled small businesses and low income earning self-employed persons who are trying to meet their financial responsibilities every week.  Their endeavours need to be rewarded. <\/p> <p>I am a solicitor in practice but I collect more money for the Government each year by way of taxes - I collect stamp duty, VAT, household charge, local property tax, but sometimes one thinks of oneself as a tax collector rather than a contributor.  I am glad to see something is being given back to the self-employed because the are the people who put themselves out on a limb, take the huge risks and ultimately employ other people and give back to communities.  It is the small businesses around the country in small villages who really get things going.  Many small rural and urban communities are only running and viable because of the small businesses that are in the vicinity.  I work in Crumlin village and Tesco and An Post are the two largest businesses in the area, the rest are small businesses ranging from the bike shop, the florist, hairdressers, charity shops.  It is really important that they are acknowledged and their work for the community is rewarded.  Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently supported the extending on a phased and voluntary basis the full range of social protections.  As part of the agreement to facilitate the minority Government, Fianna Fail looked for commitments for the self-employed.  We have succeeded in getting dental and optical benefits extended to the self-employed, which I welcome and I thank the Minister for doing that, while PRSI contributors are now eligible to qualify for the invalidity pension.  It is essential that the Minister continues to eliminate systematic discrimination against the self-employed.  The Fine Gael led Government has failed to meet its commitment under the programme for Government for full equalisation with the PAYE tax credit by 2018.  I hope that is something the Minister can examine.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill and it is essential that more is done to tackle the issue of bogus self employment.  Such situations arise where a working relationship is misclassified as a contract for services or a commercial agreement when it should be considered a contract of service or a contract of employment.  In instances where people are forced to register as self-employed it circumvents basic employee rights in respect of holiday pay, sick pay and pension contributions and deprives the State of PRSI revenue.  The practice needs to be stamped out to protect workers and the State finances.  I hope this legislation does not have a knock on effect of increasing situations of bogus self employment but I am sure the Department is tackling it to ensure bogus self employment is eradicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#NN00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I invite Senator Joe O'Reilly to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#NN00400","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>At the outset I welcome the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty to the House.  I salute her as a reforming Minister across a range of areas, whether it is the recognition of home workers, those unfortunate staff who were abused when their tips were taken and used as part of their wages or now the recognition of the rights of self-employed.  The Minister is humane and brings a breath of fresh air to the Department.  I salute that and I am very proud to do so.  I do not think there is anybody who would challenge me on that proposition.<\/p> <p>During the recession I became very emotionally involved with an individual.  This young man had a business that failed.  As a consequence of his business failing, he could get no social welfare.  The barrier to him getting any form of social welfare was that he had a small plot of land and a house that had a large mortgage as an investment rental property, which he could not get out of it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He had a wife and children, and it was a pitiful sight.  I was so emotionally involved with him at the time and I met him on many occasions because I thought the situation was dreadful.  Such was his trauma arising from this that he let his business fold, almost involuntarily, and went on to become an employee in an area that does not challenge him.  There is nothing wrong with his employment or his employer, but he works in an area where he is not challenged, accepts a much lower income than he is capable of earning and is, I suspect, frustrated.  My point is he developed a fear of being self-employed and of anything entrepreneurial.  His family felt the same and told their dad that they did not want him to be self-employed anymore.  My involvement with him brought the social welfare situation home to me in a big way.<\/p><p>It would be wrong of me not to say that I am here representing my colleague, the party spokesperson on social protection, Senator Ray Butler.  It would not be necessary to mention that were it not for the fact that he has been a pioneer and advocate in this field and a champion of the self-employed since the day he entered politics.  It is his mantra, whether at our parliamentary party meetings or in this Chamber.  He needs salutation and the work he has done to bring about this day merits public recognition.  I am sure he is proud and happy that it is being brought forward by his county colleague.<\/p><p>A few other issues merit a mention.  It is important that we do not lose entrepreneurs or make people afraid.  This cushion will give people the courage to go into business and not be afraid for themselves and their family; it is crucial that that fear be removed.  That is a very important point.  I reference again the fact that they will also be supported in job activation.  The Minister said that ways to support the self-employed in job activation are being looked at, which is important because they have so much potential and ability.  As is recognised in America in a way that it is not here, when people fail in business, it is a significant learning experience and that learning can be brought to another business; that is why they should get the support to once again make the leap.  Similar to the person who starts to drive again having been in a car accident, they need courage, personal development and to be unafraid to get into the driving seat once more and get going.<\/p><p>I am delighted that this is a continued recognition of the self-employed, to the extent that treatment benefits and the invalidity pension are now available to them.  That is great, and this is a further progression of that.  We cannot make Cinderellas of the people who, as the Minister said, sustain our small rural economies that cannot attract multinationals.  It is good that the self-employed will have the same rate of &euro;203 per week.  Why should it be otherwise?  The provisions take account also of the fact that, for PRSI, certain people pay a lump sum at the end of the year.<\/p><p>To go back to my original point, I am very keen on activation.  I am a teacher by background and think that, from day one, there should be support, encouragement and learning to help people make the great leap and go back into business, bringing their brilliance, knowledge and experience to another business to further more job creation.<\/p><p>The Minister makes the point that, because of low incomes and the nature of their circumstances, 7,000 people will get jobseeker's allowance.  That is how it should be and there is nothing to challenge that.  It is reassuring that both Class A and Class S contributions are recognised, for obvious reasons, which is an important dimension.<\/p><p>No matter what way we look at this, it creates fairness and opportunity, supports enterprise and provides a bridge, safety net and soft landing for those in the self-employed sector.  My friend who I knew during the recession was only one of many; I just happened to become involved with that case and there was something very pitiful about it.  He must have felt a shocking level of alienation, unfairness and injustice.  Why was he different?  Why was he scapegoated for having initiative, when he could not possibly but fail in the role he was in?<\/p><p>This is a good day's work, one of many from the Minister, and I laud it.  She said that it will begin in November, but this cannot happen quickly enough.  I would love to know that we will have a good activation programme and will continue to support people who create jobs at a local level.  <\/p><p>Finally, we talk about sustaining rural Ireland.  We can do that only by keeping those who run our small businesses and who create jobs and infrastructure in those areas.  A large pharmaceutical industry cannot be attracted to an isolated rural parish if there is no infrastructure.  Let us keep the people who can keep those communities going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#NN00500","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill and the extension of another social welfare support to the self-employed.  Businesses can fail and, if that happens, it is crucial that we support those who take a gamble on self-employment.  The loss of a business is difficult and lack of financial support can make a bad situation worse.  During the economic crash, we learned that the effect on self-employed people was phenomenal; there was no safety net for them and many of them emigrated or went to the wall.  I treated a lot of them.  There were a lot of mental health issues at the time because there was no income safety net.  The extension of jobseeker's benefit, which will at least assist them financially, is positive.<\/p> <p>In 2017, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection carried out a survey of Class S contributors to find out what they would like extended to them.  It is good that we had that public consultation.  Of respondents, 80% said that the range of social welfare benefits available was quite poor or very poor, and an overwhelming majority said that they would be willing to pay a higher PRSI rate in return for at least one additional social insurance benefit.  The top three benefits sought by respondents were long-term illness, short-term illness and unemployment.  Since the survey was published, the invalidity or long-term illness benefit has been extended to the self-employed, which is welcome.  This Bill will extend unemployment benefit to jobseekers, but the short-term benefit has not been extended and it must be in our future plans to do so.  It is wrong that if people who are self-employed become ill and unable to work, they have no access to any social welfare support, and this needs to be addressed urgently.  <\/p> <p>Recently, a family member of mine who is the earner in the household became seriously ill.  They will recover, but they will be out of work for four months and are relying on the generosity of the credit union and family and friends to keep the household ticking over.  There is nothing for them.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I attended the Department's briefing to be more informed on this.  The big question being mulled over involved the 250,000 people who left this island during the crash.  What would have happened if they had stayed?  The public purse would have been bled even drier than it was.  It was not sustainable and, in a way, they did us a favour by leaving because we had nothing to give.  There was no support in place for them, they had no future and so they left.  That ties into the different upcoming referenda, which are not for debate here.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That haemorrhaging of our people certainly helped the public purse and prevented us from crashing out altogether.  How do we future-proof these benefits so that they will still be available and will not be cut should another big economic crash occur?  Such cuts led to the scenario from which we are only now recovering.  <\/p><p>As I have said, the roll-out of additional benefits to the self-employed needs to continue.  Illness benefit must be prioritised.  Class S contributors spoke to us in this survey and we must listen to them.  We are not naive to the additional costs associated with extending benefits to this cohort of workers, but the Department's own survey concluded that 88% of respondents would be willing to pay PRSI at a higher rate in return for additional social insurance benefits.<\/p><p>As I have said, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill.  It is good to see benefits being extended to the self-employed but I do wish to pick up on a point that at least one other Senator, Senator Ardagh, has raised.  We need to be bold in tackling a very big issue facing the sector, namely, bogus self-employment.  Bogus self-employment is where rogue bosses deliberately misclassify workers as self-employed subcontractors in order to dodge social insurance and pension contributions, pay rates, employment law and other responsibilities.  They are dodging their responsibility to make contributions to this State.  <\/p><p>At 6 a.m. on 28 June, at the site of the new national children's hospital, in whose shadow I live, Unite held a protest against the bogus self-employment it believes is going on at the site.  This protest was attended by Patricia King and many other supporters.  The noise of the protest competed with that of the workers, which is another issue I will take up.  This is a big issue.  It deprives the State purse of resources and spending power.  We must act to end this practice.  There are big financial gains for these employers.  These classifications are fraudulent.  This is not a victimless crime.  The costs are paid by the workers, good employers and the State.  Workers forced into bogus self-employment are also denied the rights and protection directly-employed workers are entitled to under employment law and collective agreements.<\/p><p>Last month, my colleague, Deputy Brady, introduced a Bill to tackle this very issue.  This Bill stands up for these workers and for the State.  It not only seeks to make it an offence to issue a self-employed contract to an employee, but it goes much further in ensuring that the self-employed receive the same basic rights and protections as employees, such as annual leave and pay.<\/p><p>I compliment the Minister on this Bill, which will have a positive impact for those who are self-employed.  I ask her to address the issue of short-term illness benefit and the concerns I have expressed in respect of bogus self-employment in her response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#OO00200","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562146200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill for discussion before the summer.  I hope that we will have a chance to engage further in respect of amendments in the autumn.  I see that it is planned to ensure there is space and time to allow Senators to supplement or contribute to the Bill.  Issues have been raised in respect of short-term illness benefit.  There are some other practical issues on which I will engage, for example, the ability to make voluntary contributions.  As we know there are constraints on those who wish to make such contributions such as thresholds that must be reached.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on a few technical issues of that nature on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>I will speak to some of the more general concerns and questions I have.  It is very important that the State offer a safety net and support for everybody who needs it at the time they most need it.  I recognise that many people have moved back and forth between employment and self-employment.  It should not be the case that people find themselves at a distance from the State.  I refer not only to State support payments, but to associated supports in respect of activation and access to training and employment.  It is also important to be clear that self-employment takes a wide variety of forms.  While the kind that has been discussed at great length today is the entrepreneur who is an employer, European figures show that only 23% of self-employed people in Europe are employers.  The Minister may have comparable figures for Ireland.  While the small businesspeople we have discussed do exist, they comprise less than a quarter of the self-employed cohort in Europe.  Perhaps the figures for Ireland could be found.  <\/p> <p>Almost as many people across Europe are vulnerable workers.  We know that this is also an issue in Ireland.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and I have seen it.  The term \"vulnerable workers\" refers to those classed as being particularly vulnerable to exploitation and who may not have control over the circumstances of their work or employment.  In many cases such people fall into the category of what has been called bogus self-employment.  I would divide this into two categories: false self-employment and forced self-employment.  As the Minister will be very aware, the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection has heard very strong and striking testimony on these issues.  Senator Nash, who is not here today as he is at the conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, has tabled legislation on this issue, as has Deputy Brady.  I know the Minister has asked to see the results of the committee's discussions to assist her in potentially progressing her own legislation on this matter.  <\/p> <p>This issue needs to be tackled alongside, if not in advance of, the issues addressed by today's Bill.  They must be progressed in parallel.  We cannot be seen to provide any further incentive for employers engaged in bad practice to press or force people into the type of bogus self-employment seen at present where employers effectively determine whether people are employees or should be considered as contractors.  There is a question as to the definition of a worker.  The European figures I mentioned suggest that determining what is a worker or an employee is an issue Europe-wide.<\/p> <p>This Bill also has very significant economic implications.  Those who are classed as PRSI employees make contributions at the rate of 14.75%.  In many cases the self-employed pay 4%.  The employer is, of course, not required to make an equivalent contribution.  We have to be very cognisant of ensuring that this Bill gives people the protection and support they need while not contributing to the problem of employers who have been involved in bad practice being let off the hook for contributions to the public Exchequer.  That is an issue.  I say that in the context of wanting to support people by giving them access to these payments but also wanting to ensure that employers feel pressure from the State.  I urge the Minister to ensure that legislation to address bogus self-employment and to ensure that all those categorised as self-employed have chosen self-employment and are accurately categorised is progressed at least in parallel with, if not in advance of, this Bill.  Unfortunately, we cannot say that all those categorised as self-employed in the State are accurately categorised.<\/p> <p>We are looking at a smaller level of PRSI contribution, although I have made the case that some contributions are made which are not measurable in the same way as a direct PRSI contribution, such as the contributions made by carers from which the State has benefitted so much.  The State may have to provide supplements to balance out these contributions.  This relates to other issues in our pension systems such as the idea of a care credit.  If such measures are to be included in budget 2020, it will require the Minister for Finance to recognise that a general taxpayer subsidy needs to be provided and increased.  Bringing self-employed persons into this net of safety and protection, which is important, and recognising and supporting such people, should not come at the cost of other social welfare payments but may require instead an additional contribution from the Exchequer and the State as a whole.  That is a financial question.  A case can be made for such action.  The case for such measures for carers can certainly be made.  Others have made that case.  I say these things in the context of the Minister's plans to progress this Bill in the autumn, when debate on the budget will be under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070300002#PP00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562146200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
