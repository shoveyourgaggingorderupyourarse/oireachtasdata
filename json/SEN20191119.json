There are men and women going about their normal daily business in the midlands today who would not be with us were it not for the fantastic service provided by the Irish Air Corps, the National Ambulance Service and the AC112 air ambulance helicopter, based in Athlone, since 2012.  Similarly, men and women are going about their daily business today unaware of the fact that they may one day need these services.  The service is called upon on a nearly daily basis.  Last year alone, it responded to 159 serious car crashes and 146 other medical emergencies, and provided 15 urgent transports of children to hospitals.  The Minister of State will understand that there is a degree of concern in my home town of Athlone and the surrounding counties regarding any threat to the future of this service.<\/p> <p>I understand the current situation and ongoing HR challenges faced by the Air Corps, particularly with regard to the recruitment and retention of pilots.  I also understand that for training reasons, the Air Corps will not be in a position to accept emergency aeromedical requests by the National Ambulance Service for four days per month between now and the end of February 2020.  Furthermore, I accept that the Irish Coast Guard will provide reserve cover to the National Ambulance Service for the 16 days during which the Air Corps is not accepting taskings, and that further backup from the Cork-based Irish Community Rapid Response, ICRR, helicopter has been explored.<\/p> <p>I am not happy that we are in this situation.  I have been a constant thorn in the Minister of State's side regarding funding for the Defence Forces.  I accept that this training is necessary and that the cover arrangements put in place aim to provide the best service possible using all available resources.  However, there is fear in the midlands, particularly in Athlone, that this is the thin end of the wedge, which might signal the winding down of this very valuable service.  This fear has been stoked by certain public representatives for their own political purposes, but is nonetheless causing concern among the general public.  I would like the Minister of State to allay those concerns.  I ask him to address only one issue, namely, the future of this service.  I do not need to hear an explanation of the current situation or the provisions put in place to address it.  I have heard and understand the assurances from the Department in that regard.  I am asking the Minister of State to make an unequivocal statement in this House that the service provided by the air ambulance helicopter in Athlone will not be wound down or reduced in any way and will continue to be based in Custume Barracks in Athlone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#B00500","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McFadden for raising this important matter.

Our focus is on returning the EAS to full capacity from the end of February 2020.

This is in line with the Government's decision in 2015 to establish the emergency aeromedical service.  The Irish Community Rapid Response, ICRR, emergency medical service has agreed to provide additional cover using a second helicopter which will be based in Roscommon on the days when the Air Corps will not be in a position to accept taskings for the EAS.  The ICRR will also continue to be available in the south of the country.  I am focused on returning the EAS to a full service and full capacity.

The shared priority is to provide the best available service using all available resources during the four days in each month when the Air Corps will not be available for EAS taskings.

As the Minister of State will be aware, the hospital has been open since 2013 and, in fact, the official sod-turning by Senator Reilly, then Minister for Health, happened on 3 February 2012.  Yet, despite the Government spending &euro;8 million on this new facility, only 19 of the beds are open at this stage and 21 remain to be opened.  We must bear in mind we have been waiting six years for the opening of the second floor of the hospital.<\/p> <p>The excuse that has been given time and again in this House is the issue of recruitment.  We are producing far more nurses per head of population than most European countries yet we are exporting most of them.  They are being offered jobs in England, Australia and the Middle East, and they are taking up those jobs.  For some reason, the offers that are being put out by the Government every year or six months are not being taken up, and that reason is that the pay and conditions are simply not good enough.<\/p> <p>The excuse applies not only to Kenmare Community Hospital but also to Dingle Community Hospital, on which &euro;14 million was spent and where 60 beds were provided but only 43 are open, again, due to the lack of nurses being recruited by the HSE.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hope the Minister of State does not give me the same reply I got six months ago, a year ago, two years ago, two and a half years ago or any time I have been allowed to ask this question that it is still trying to recruit.

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  Residential care is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the net budget for long-term residential care in 2019 is &euro;985 million, and more than 33,000 clients on average at any one time will be in receipt of financial support.  Over the last two years, an additional &euro;45 million has been provided to the nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, budget.  In 2020, the NHSS will see a further investment into its budget of &euro;45 million, bringing the total annual budget for the NHSS to &euro;1.03 billion.<\/p> <p>Public residential care units such as Kenmare Community Hospital, County Kerry, are an essential part of our healthcare infrastructure.  In total they provide about 5,000 long-stay beds, amounting to 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds nationally.  There are also about 2,000 short-stay community public beds.<\/p> <p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social care services, including the Kenmare Community Hospital.  HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4, which includes County Kerry, is committed to delivering services for older persons through a community-based approach that is supporting older people to live in their own homes and communities and when needed in residential care, such as Kenmare Community Hospital.<\/p> <p>Currently, there are 19 beds open at Kenmare Community Hospital with the potential to open up another further 21 in the future.  While the HSE had planned to open a number of additional beds at the community hospital on a phased basis, it has unfortunately faced challenges in recruiting the extra nurses needed.  The existing nursing staff complement for the 19 existing beds is 8.66 nursing whole-time equivalents along with 7.86 healthcare assistants.  However, in order to open an additional nine beds, a further 5.11 nurses, whole-time equivalents, WTEs, are required, so another five nurses are required to open the nine beds.<\/p> <p>I have been assured that the increasing capacity of Kenmare Community Hospital remains a priority for the HSE and that it is continuing to make intensive efforts to recruit nursing staff.  I am also informed that the executive has run three recruitment campaigns in the last year alone, the most recent recruitment campaign being in September 2019, when every effort was made to recruit the necessary staff.  Unfortunately, no suitable candidates were recruited at that time.  The HSE fully understands the importance of Kenmare Community Hospital to the local community and appreciates the excellent care provided by the staff there.<\/p> <p>I note that the recent inspection report published earlier this year by the Health Information and Quality Authority acknowledged that the centre was warm, bright and comfortable and met the needs of the residents, so we have great confidence in the hospital.  In general, the inspector observed that the care and support given to residents was respectful, relaxed and unhurried.  Staff were familiar with the residents' preferences and choices and facilitated these in a friendly and respectful manner.<\/p> <p>The local HSE management has assured the Department of Health that it will continue to work to extend the services in Kenmare.  The HSE has informed the Department that the hospital has an excellent reputation locally as a care facility and that the welfare of its residence is a priority for staff and management and that they are deeply appreciative of the support the hospital receives from the families in the wider community.<\/p> <p>In line with the usual process, the HSE will continue to review all of its services to ensure the continued provision of high quality, value-for-money residential care with the older person at the centre of all decisions made.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I will bring the Senator's genuine concerns back to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#E00300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come here to give the reply on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.

I was initially involved in the setting up of a cross-departmental approach but I am not satisfied with the results to date.  During the summer, the parents worked extremely hard to secure chair silencers for classrooms.  We were told there was no funding available and that it should come from a minor works grant.  It is unbelievable that there is no funding within the Department to provide chair silencers for children who have been affected by an audiology misdiagnosis.  After much back and forth between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE, we finally got approval for chair silencers.<\/p><p>Some children have been approved for one sound field system, but many need two because they receive resource teaching in another room.

The new special education teaching allocation provides a single, unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on that school's educational profile, to allow schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools.  Schools deploy additional teaching resources based on each pupil's individual learning needs.  The visiting teaching service has assessed the educational needs of all nine children and made recommendations to their schools.  In accordance with the visiting teachers' service referral process and procedures, children with mild or unilateral hearing loss are placed on the \"On Request\" caseload and children with moderate-profound hearing loss are placed on the \"Active\" caseload of the visiting teacher.  The visiting teachers have assessed the acoustic conditions in the schools and made recommendations to schools to put in place appropriate measures to cater for the children's needs.<\/p> <p>All nine children have received assistive technology, in accordance with the criteria of the scheme.  With regard to teacher training, the NCSE can provide direct support to the schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible.

The Minister of State may remember that earlier this year, it was reported by the World Health Organization that levels of nitrogen dioxide, which comes from dirty diesel, were exceeded in Dublin and two other locations.  Many of our rural towns are still burning dirty coal.  By early next year, there is no doubt that we will be in breach of the EU safety levels for nitrogen dioxide.  This is already having a serious health and environmental impact on the citizens of Dublin.  I do not think it is a case of being found to have exceeded levels because I have spoken to the EPA, which told me that it is a matter of time as it has increased its monitoring within the capital.  The EPA expects to have the results of this monitoring early next year and expects that we will be in violation of the limits.  Where that has happened previously in other European countries, hundreds of millions of euro in fines have been levied.<\/p> <p>We need to put a plan in place.  We do not need to get official notification that the air quality in our cities is poor.  We know that for a fact.  It is within this Government's gift to start protecting our citizens.  We should not necessarily be worried about the hundreds of millions of euro in fines this country could face but the fact that the EPA says that 1,180 people die prematurely because of poor air quality in our cities, mainly in Dublin, not to mention the number of families with young children that are affected leading to increased use of medication and illness.  We must put a plan in place to improve our air quality.  This decline in air quality has been caused by Government policy that encouraged people to drive cars running on dirty diesel.  Those decisions were made in 2007 and 2008.  We are losing over 1,000 citizens through premature death due to poor air quality.  <\/p> <p>Is the Government prepared to tell the four local authorities in Dublin to put a plan together to ensure that air quality does not breach EU standards?  As I said, it has already breached World Health Organization standards.  There is only one answer I need from the Minister of State - \"Yes\" or \"No\".  If the answer is \"No\", the likelihood is that another 1,180 citizens will die in the next year.  This number is far higher than the number of people who die through road traffic accidents.  Must we say to affected families that their parent, brother or sister has to die because we have not been prepared to take preventative action now?  We should not wait but do it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#K00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The EPA report entitled Air Quality in Ireland 2018, which was published in September, sets out the current status of Ireland's air quality.

However, it also showed that the stricter World Health Organization guideline values, which are lower and, therefore, offer greater protection, were exceeded at a number of monitoring sites for fine particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, N02. The report also indicated that EU limit values for N02 are likely to be exceeded in the near future at recently installed traffic monitoring sites in Dublin.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2432\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2432&amp;amp;pid=SeanCanney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The main pollutants of concern are particulate matter from the burning of residential solid fuel and N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">from transport in urban area.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> These findings were consistent with those that emerged from an earlier monitoring report from the EPA, Urban Environmental Indicators - Nitrogen Dioxide Levels in Dublin, which was released in July this year.  It also indicated that some areas around certain heavily trafficked roads in the Dublin area may have higher levels of air pollution than previously indicated.  These higher levels are due primarily to traffic and some locations are at risk of exceeding the statutory EU limit for the pollutant nitrogen dioxide or N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">is an air pollutant associated with urban areas and is strongly linked with traffic emissions.  Diesel vehicles have historically far higher N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">emissions than other combustion engines, especially for older vehicles.  Exposures to high levels over short periods can give rise to acute health effects, while long-term exposure to elevated concentrations of N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">may contribute to the development of asthma and potentially increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.  People with asthma, as well as children and the elderly, are generally at greater risk from the poor health effects caused by N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Because of these health effects, N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">is a controlled pollutant under the clean air for Europe directive, which sets limits on N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">levels in the ambient air.  An annual average limit value of 40 <\/font>g<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">per cubic metre is in place to protect against the human health effects of long-term exposure and an hourly limit value of 200 <\/font>g<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">per cubic metre protects against acute exposure.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> While previous EPA reports had indicated that N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">levels were potentially problematic in Ireland and approaching EU limit values in urban areas, the July report in particular presented new evidence that N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">may exceed the annual EU limit value on certain city centre streets, along the M50 motorway and around the entrance and exit from the Dublin Port tunnel.  It should be noted that the report also indicated that levels of N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">fall with distance from roadways and are well within EU limits away from busy roads and in many residential areas.  Around the M50, the highest concentrations are within 10 m of the motorway edge, with levels falling to background levels at a distance of 50 m to 75 m.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> The matter of air quality and particularly the potential human health effects of poor air equality are a matter of serious concern to this Government.  This is why considerable support is being provided by my Department to roll out the national ambient air quality monitoring programme, under which additional air quality monitoring stations are being installed in Dublin and across the country.  This programme is already providing better quality real-time information on localised air quality, which is very useful in the context of the development of air quality policies by my Department and in ensuring that local authorities take appropriate actions to tackle the challenge within their area of responsibility.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> For example, preliminary results from one of these new stations, at St John's Road West, near Heuston Station, indicate that Dublin is on course to exceed the annual N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">limit value by the end of the year.  If this happens, local authorities in Dublin and its suburbs will then be legally required to prepare air quality action plans to bring pollution levels back within the limit values in their area of responsibility.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> The findings of the report are very concerning and only highlight the need to implement the climate action plan.  This plan includes a number of actions which will have a significant impact on reducing emissions and improving air quality.  These include the development of a regulatory framework for low-emission zones and providing local authorities with the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or a town to zero-emission vehicles only.  We are also committed to reaching 180,000 electric and hybrid vehicles on our roads by 2025 and nearly 1 million by 2030.  Electrifying our private and public transport fleets will have a highly positive impact on air quality, particularly on N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">levels in our towns and cities.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> In the meantime, the Government is, as a priority, establishing an inter-agency group whose membership will include the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Transport, Tourism and Sport, four Dublin local authorities, the EPA, and other stakeholders as necessary to, <\/font><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">inter alia<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">, consider a range of options for potential measures to improve air quality and any associated actions and supports required to facilitate their effective uptake to address N0<\/font><sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2<\/font><\/sub><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">and other air pollution and identify measures most suitable to Dublin, as well as in other urban locations in Ireland generally.

More than 80 children in the Dublin 12 area have not had formal in-school education.  The Minister for Education and Skills admitted last week that there are serious discrepancies and inadequacies in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, supports for children, especially because of the lack of specialised units in mainstream schools.  There is a notion that schools may have to be forced to provide supports under section 37 of the new Act.  Last Saturday, we campaigned outside Scoil Colm on Armagh Road.  This is a beautiful large school, which is now closed and lying empty.  It would be perfect to retrofit for the use of the children of Dublin 12 who need a specialist school with ASD supports.

For the joint Defence Forces and Department of Defence annual reports in 2015 and 2016, high-level groups were put together to report on the emergency air ambulance service.  The Minister of State and the Department, and everybody and anybody under the sun, were aware of the fact there would be serious shortcomings down the line.  The recommendations of those two groups were ignored completely and were totally and utterly rejected.  The Minister of State then went on to say a number of pilots had been recommissioned into the Air Corps.  The truth is that one is a lieutenant-colonel who will not fly because he has an administrative rank, and the second is a captain who, I am sure, is not going to be given the keys of a helicopter and told, \"Good lad, off you go and fly helicopters for us\".  At the end of the day, I am afraid that is not good enough.<\/p> <p>I could go through a plethora of issues.  The Leader is smiling away.  One of the places we might look is in his own backyard in Cork, where two ships costing millions of euro are tied up with no crew to sail them.  The announcement yesterday, which was cynical to say the least, of the tax relief that has been provided for sailors was a 12th-hour announcement.  The truth is that most seagoing people have had that allowance for years.<\/p> <p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That the Taoiseach and Minister for Defence, if possible, or the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe, be brought to this House today at 6:15 p.m. to deal with the issues raised on the \"Saturday with Cormac &Oacute; hEadhra\" programme and a plethora of other issues in regard to the Defence Forces.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#P01600","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The amendment cannot be on a plethora of issues.

He was in Leinster House to hand in a letter to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I am referring to a topic that has been raised countless times in this Chamber, on all sides, which is the despicable treatment meted out to community employment, CE, supervisors in regard to their pensions and entitlements and rulings by the Labour Court that have been ignored by the Government.  Looking back at the record, I see this was raised last February and last April, and I am going to raise it again today.  I cannot begin to express the level of frustration and anger that union members and CE supervisors feel.  Here is the level of contempt - that is the only word I can use - that the Government has for these people: it refuses to even engage in correspondence or to acknowledge getting letters requesting meetings.  As I pointed out previously, and as other Members across the Chamber have pointed out, these are not well paid staff.  These are staff who have given tremendous service across the country in all constituencies, and they have been completely ignored by the Government.<\/p> <p>These recommendations go back to 2005 and 2008.  The message that the Government sends to private sector employers is that it they are the subject of a Labour Court recommendation, they can ignore it because it is ignoring these recommendations.  The letter refers to the high-level forum established by the previous Government under the Lansdowne Road agreement to deal with these matters.  The agreement states that the high-level forum will be convened by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, involving the relevant Departments and agencies, and will meet on a quarterly basis.  That is pretty straightforward, except it has not met since December 2017, almost two years ago.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That shows absolute contempt for the workers and the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Department does not even have the decency to reply to letters, which is the reason a number of people hand delivered them this morning to the office of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  I am seeking a debate on the matter.<\/p><p>The second issue I want to raise is the change to the retirement age from 2021, from when people will have to work until the age of 67 years.  As the contracts of many will expire when they reach the age of 66 years, they will have to sign on for one year, resulting in a weekly cut in their income of &euro;45.  Is this the way we should be treating people who have worked for a lifetime in the State?  It speaks to the constant theme of contempt of the Government for trade unions, working people, employment rights and so on.  We need to debate this matter.  It is not fair or proper that workers, on reaching the age of 66 years, should be forced to sign on for one year and take a cut of &euro;45 per week in comparison to their pension payment.  These changes have been proposed, but there has been no proper debate about them.  I want to hear what Members on each side of the Chamber have to say aobut the proposed increase in the retirement age.  Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to this measure.  We call on the Government to leave the retirement age at 66 years.  Let us have a proper debate on to fund social services and pensions.  I would welcome the opportunity to debates on both matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#P02000","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I want to highlight a couple of issues related to the Order of Business.  The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations are to be referred without debate to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  While I do not propose an amendment to the Order of Business, I ask the Leader to provide an opportunity at some point to debate policy on the horse and greyhound racing fund, a substantial and guaranteed fund of &euro;55 million per annum.  Approximately &euro;80 million was allocated for the fund last year.  It is a huge subsidy that, legally, is automatically built in every year.  We need to debate if it is the best use of public funds.  In previous debates following calls for support on key issues, including animal welfare and social welfare payments, we were asked to point to areas in which changes could be made.  This is one area in which we may need to make changes.  We need to consider if it is the best use of public resources and whether it should be reviewed and revised.  While I am happy to support the proposal that the motion be referred to the joint committee without debate, I ask that when it is returned to the Seanad, or perhaps in advance of the taking of the Finance Bill 2019, we be given an opportunity to debate it.<\/p> <p>I also ask the to Leader schedule a debate on the issue of child homelessness.  The number of children experiencing homelessness now stands at 4,000.  Last week two reports on the issue were published, namely, the report on family and child homelessness by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and the report on the impact of homelessness on children by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  The joint launching of the reports was unprecedented.  This shows that the issue is emerging as a source of massive concern and that homelessness is affecting, in particular, the next generation and their opportunities.  The model in place is creating intergenerational poverty and inequality.  We need to address the issue.  I would, therefore, welcome an opportunity to debate both reports and, in particular, child homelessness.  The reports acknowledge the long-lasting detrimental effects of homelessness on children which extend into their adult lives.  They also contain a number of recommendations.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to come to the House to debate these issues as a matter of urgency?<\/p> <p>I have just returned from the 25th International Conference on Population and Development, ICPD, which was held in Nairobi.

After the passage of the marriage equality legislation, he married his partner.  This was subsequently discovered and anonymous communications were sent to the Presbyterian Church, enclosing a copy of his marriage certificate, photographs from social media of him with his new family, enjoying himself on holiday and so on.  A commission was then established.  The identity of the accuser was never made clear and this gentleman has now been deposed from his position as an elder of the Presbyterian Church.  It seems extraordinary to me.  I wonder where marriage equality has got us on this one.  I understand that churches are exempt from some of these operations but it is great pity.

We are heading into the Christmas season.  It is extraordinary how Christmas comes around earlier and earlier.  One of these days, it will start before the Listowel races in September with the way it is going.  I wish to remind people around the country about the importance of shopping locally at a time when so much money will be spent.  I am not saying that I am opposed to online shopping; we live in the real world.  People from the country like to have their big days out in Dublin, Cork or wherever they go.  I was in the drapery trade for many years, however, and we all know that Christmas shopping is the lifeblood of the small or medium retailer.  Such retailers need a good Christmas to get through the year.  I would like to uphold the good service that people are accustomed to getting in their own towns from long-established firms such as mine used to be.  People should shop locally and be patriotic.  We need jobs in small towns.  We are trying to regenerate rural Ireland.  This is time for people to put their hands in their pockets and support local industry.  They will get value and service.<\/p> <p>On a more serious note, we had an important event in the D&aacute;il last week when all the young people gathered and had a wonderful debate on climate change and so on.  It was great to see young people having an interest in politics, which I have always encouraged.  Now I am not so sure.  I am not a child and I know that politics was never the boy scouts.  I do not want to be too po-faced about it since we have to have the cut and thrust.  I am personally becoming alarmed, however, at the standards that obtain at present in politics in Ireland.  I do not point a finger at any single individual or party.  It is quite the opposite but I think a race to the bottom has been going on in these Houses in recent months, as well as in comments in the media, from all parties and addressed against all parties.  It is suddenly no longer about policy or the economy but seems to be about what one did or said, or what one can be caught doing.  I dread what will happen between now and when the election is called in May or whenever, if we spend all the time trawling and digging and having our officers and backroom staff at that kind of game.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#S01000","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#S01100","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Politics is an honourable profession.

Of course, America can do what it likes in some respects and can state what it does or does not consider to be unlawful.  However, if there is to be complete demolition of the concept of international law rules, if the idea of occupation and settlement of territory seized in war and expulsion of the people in it is to be legitimised and regarded <i>de facto<\/i>with impunity as a state of affairs, that is a serious matter, on which Ireland should take a stand.  The T&aacute;naiste should come to the House to explain to us where Ireland really stands on it and whether it has the guts to state twe object strongly to this d&eacute;marche by the Americans.<br\/><br\/>I want to add one footnote, without naming the writer.  In the last week a letter writer to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>who is probably known to most Members of this House wrote to the effect that the rendering illegal of settlement goods produced in the Occupied Territories was of a piece with requiring Israelis, if they came to Ireland, to wear the Star of David.  That is deeply offensive to those of us who supported the Bill, who strongly support the right of the state of Israel to exist and who agree with the many people in Israel who oppose the occupation of the Palestinian territories.

I am not sure what the reason is but the My World 2 survey, carried out by UCD in conjunction with Jigsaw, tried to build up a picture of our youth and their mental health and well-being.  It recently conducted this survey of almost 20,000 young people between 12 and 25 years of age.  Under 25 years of age is the peak time for the onset of mental health issues.  This was the largest survey of its kind, and the number of people suffering from anxiety has doubled since the last survey in 2012.  Some 22% report severe and very severe anxiety in the 12 to 19 age bracket, and 26% report the same in the 18 to 25 age bracket, with females most likely to suffer.

The scheme itself had been shut since 2015.  Some 225 farmers and growers applied for the scheme last November.  They did not take this decision lightly.  They thought long and hard about it.  They did the prerequisite organic courses, paid organic certification membership fees and many hired advisers to do this.<\/p> <p>Almost a year through the two-year conversion process, having spent much money and time on this conversion, whether it was buying organic seed or converting farm buildings, 175 of them found out in the last week or so that their applications had been unsuccessful.

As we are all aware, it is a very important service and saves many lives.  Earlier this afternoon, Senator McFadden raised this directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  It is very disappointing that a community rapid-response charity helicopter would be required to fill the gap of what should be a fundamental service provided by the State.  Obviously, it is positive that the second helicopter will be based in Roscommon.  However, at a wider scale, it is a fundamental service which has saved many lives and has the potential to save many more.  It should be fully provided by the State.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State said this afternoon, there are difficulties with staffing.  He referred to the recommissioning of former Air Corps pilots, the reintroduction of the service commitment scheme for pilots and the training of junior pilots.  This crucial service should be provided by the State.<\/p> <p>The road ambulance service has particular challenges and black spots.

We need to ensure we support people to get to a centre of excellence or hospital as needs be as quickly as possible.  We need to ensure our road ambulance service functions fully.

The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, reiterated and emphasised to Senator McFadden this afternoon that it will continue to be based in Athlone, but there are issues with the staffing of that service.

This happens over and over again in regard to local authorities, especially within the Dublin area.  I sometimes wonder what Fine Gael has against Dublin or what Dublin has done to Fine Gael to be treated in such a manner.  We see the same thing in regard to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, where there was a commitment that it would not be a drag on the local authority.  We now see it is a drag, with the loss of services which other Senators have raised in regard to the cost of support for the harbour.<\/p><p>There is a big, crying issue in regard to the funding of local authorities.  It does not matter what political party anyone comes from but, at this time of the year, as the councils are passing their budgets, we see clearly the difficulties and, in many ways, the contradictions.  For example, councillors vote for a decrease in the property tax and are prepared to vote for an increase in social housing rents.<\/p><p>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business calling on the Minister to attend today to discuss in detail the funding of local government.  Local government is the bedrock of Irish democracy and it is the closest interface with the citizens.  It is not right that councillors should be put in this position due to decisions that are made by the Government.  They were given a clear commitment that the transfer of Irish Water would be revenue neutral but it is not.  I formally move that amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#V00600","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>On a somewhat related matter, the issue of the Moorhead report was raised last week.  To be fair, right across this House, among Senators on all sides, there is a desire to have the report published so we can have a discussion on what is in it.  I read the Leader's response last week and he said it should be published, and rightly so.  We need the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to come to the House.  I was talking to Councillor Joe Malone from Kilkenny, who is in the Visitors Gallery and is very welcome.  The Minister of State, who is from Councillor Malone's constituency, has responsibility for local government.  There is anxiety throughout the country to get this report published, for good or for bad, whatever is in it.  I do not think it is going to contain what most people want, and I say this as somebody who was lucky to be on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for 12 and a half years.  I identify with the issues Senator Humphreys and other Senators have raised in regard to local government.  I could talk about the property tax all day but I will not as I will do that on another day.<\/p> <p>On the Moorhead report, people need to appreciate that councillors in 2008, 2009 and 2010 took hits.  They took a class of PRSI they had never paid before, a 4% super-tax that has been somewhat dealt with in terms of the class S measure, a USC charge of 5.5% and a cut of 25% in their travel and subsistence.  This was all taken at the time and most of it was not really reinstated in any meaningful way.  Many of us have been councillors in the past and we know councillors work extremely hard, with long hours on top of trying to have family balance, work-life balance, hold down a career and so on.  A huge amount of time is put in.  Let us have a look at this report.  It was promised 21 months ago and there was an interim report last Christmas.  Although I will not put down an amendment to the Order of Business without talking to the Leader, we need the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, or the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come to the House to tell us what is holding it up and when it is going to be published.

The US is demonstrating yet again that it is determined to rip up decades of carefully developed international law and human rights protections.  It is frightening, not because of some obscure legal argument but because it paves the way for formal annexation of the West Bank and for immense suffering on the ground.  The Geneva Convention is absolutely clear that transferring civilians to occupied territory seized during war is illegal.  It is a war crime, under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and there is overwhelming international legal consensus on this point.  It has been reaffirmed time and again by the UN, the EU, the International Court of Justice and the Government.  In Europe, we need to recognise that we are at a crossroads.  If we maintain the policy of the past decades, which is essentially to criticise the Israeli occupation but support it financially, we will facilitate annexation.  We have been copying and pasting the same statement of concern for years.  If we carry on down this path, we will drive past the last exit on the road to annexation and the possibility of an independent Palestinian state will be gone.  We will not be able to say we did not see it coming.  Last year, I tabled the Occupied Territories Bill so that we could take a meaningful, peaceful, concrete step against this process and the settlements.  We famously stood up and offered leadership on apartheid South Africa in the 1980s and I call on the Government to show some bravery and do the same in this regard.  We can pass this Bill tomorrow with its support.  I call on the Government to drop the pretence of legal opposition to the Bill and listen to the UN human rights rapporteur, Michael Lynk, who just last month urged the international community to end its financial support for the illegal settlements and ban the import of settlement goods.  I urge the Government to read the letter published in <i>The Guardian<\/i>this week from a group of eminent Israeli citizens, including former ambassadors, attorneys general, speakers of the parliament and recipients of the Israel Prize.  They say:<\/p><blockquote>We believe that the occupation is morally corrosive, strategically shortsighted, and thoroughly detrimental to peace. The international community has taken insufficient action in addressing this reality. Europe continues to support the occupation financially by allowing trade with Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.  . . . <br \/><br \/>As Israelis who care about the future of our country, we ask the European Union to ban the import of settlement goods in order to support a just future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.<\/blockquote> <p>This Government needs to realise that the<i>status quo<\/i>has not worked and it will only lead to annexation.

This is a significant point in the context of the important debates we must continue to have about migration.  This particular initiative goes back to 2015 when the Government established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  It is important we get local communities engaging with refugees, welcoming them into communities in practical ways such as receiving them when they first come to the country and assisting them with all that is necessary in connection with settling down and thriving in Ireland.  I commend the work of that programme and urge communities to get involved.<\/p> <p>The closure of the Cuisle holiday centre in Donamon, County Roscommon, has been a decision of the Irish Wheelchair Association which has invoked a passionate and critical response from service users and their families.  My colleague, Senator Hopkins, has raised this issue eloquently, as have others.  The consensus among many observers, including the Taoiseach, is that this decision is regrettable.  Indeed, the Taoiseach conceded the decision will have a negative impact on the economy in the region, as well as everything else, because 48 jobs will be lost at the centre.<\/p> <p>I welcome and commend the Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, Deputy Harty, for inviting the Irish Wheelchair Association to a meeting to give a comprehensive account of its actions in this matter.  I hope to participate in that meeting.  There appears to have been no genuine or meaningful engagement with service users prior to the shock announcement of the centre&rsquo;s closure.  Many of those who protested outside the gates of Leinster House last week felt utterly betrayed by the Irish Wheelchair Association.  They also felt shut out of the decision-making process by an organisation which supposedly has been representing their concerns.<\/p> <p>Only last July, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, assured the other House that the provision of respite services, to enhance cost efficiency and continuous quality improvement, including those at Cuisle, would continue to be provided and that all this would be done in consultation with all the families of people with disabilities.  Here we are, however, four months later and the service at Cuisle is being dismantled against fierce local and national opposition.  The Irish Wheelchair Association claims its rationale is consistent with the policy trajectory in the HSE document, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings, A Strategy for Community Inclusion.  Who are the real beneficiaries, however?  What has happened under the heading of consolidating a healthcare service is affecting inappropriately what is in fact a holiday facility for people.  It seems to have been done in a top-down way without consultation.  We need to continue to keep the pressure on about this issue.  We should certainly take an interest in what will happen at the health committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#AA00700","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#AA00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I hope it will continue to be referred to in this House and we will not have seen an end of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#AA00900","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Last, but certainly not least, I call Senator Wilson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#AA01000","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.<\/p> <p>I welcome Councillor Joe Malone from Kilkenny city to the Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#AA01100","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>He has already been mentioned.

I talk to colleagues on all sides of this House, who are in total agreement that our councillors should be paid properly for the work they do on our behalf.  They are at the coalface of our democracy.  I know the Leader is totally approachable with regard to this matter but I would impress upon him the need for the Moorhead report to be published as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>I endorse what Senator Craughwell said about helicopter and emergency services provided by the Defence Forces and the unfortunate difficulties in which they find themselves.  I know Senator McFadden agrees that there needs to be an urgent review of the pay and conditions of the Defence Forces.  The reality is that morale is at an all-time low.  While I acknowledge that the Government is attempting to do something to rectify the situation, unfortunately, it is not enough.  While I support Senator Craughwell's call for the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to come to the House, the situation is urgent enough to require the attendance of the Taoiseach, who is the Minister for Defence.  I am aware that unlike a lot of previous taoisigh, he has attended this House on two occasions, which I welcome.  The last time the Taoiseach was here was April 2019 but it is important that he comes to the House before the end of the year to address both the difficulties within our Defence Forces and the difficulties relating to topics like health, social welfare, employment and councillors' pay and conditions, issues about which a number of other Senators have concerns.  Let us hear at first hand what he has to say about all these matters.  I ask Senator Craughwell to allow the Leader some time to seek the attendance of the Taoiseach in this House to address those issues, primarily the Defence Forces.  He is the Minister for Defence and has ultimate responsibility for that portfolio and I would like to see him in attendance in this House before the end of the year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#BB00300","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the 21 Members of the House for their contribution to the Order of Business today.

I would be happy to have a debate on the matter in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Hackett raised the issue of the rejection of applications under the organic farming scheme.  I do not have information on the matter to hand.  Again, a Commencement matter might be a more expeditious way of getting a response but I am happy to arrange for a debate on the matter raised by the Senator in due course.  <\/p><p>Senator Hopkins also raised the issue of the Loughglynn ambulance service.  Again, I do not have information on that matter to hand but I acknowledge it is a matter of concern to Senator Hopkins.  A Commencement matter might be a more expeditious way of getting a response.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys raised the matter of local government.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, are not available today but I would be happy to ask them to come to the House next Tuesday for a debate on local government.  <\/p><p>Senators Horkan, Boyhan and Wilson raised the issue of the Moorhead report.  There is an obligation on Government to publish that report.  All of us accept the importance of local government and the enormous contribution that our elected local government members play in the functioning of local government, the growth in their workload and the increased pressure on all members of local government.  There will be no shying away from that on this side of the House.  I have asked the Minister to set aside a date in his diary for a debate.  I have not yet had a response in regard to the publication of the Moorhead report.  It is an important debate that we need to have.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the specific issue of members of Cork County Council who now are members of Cork City Council.  The matter he raised is an important one but it is not one that I believe should be raised on the floor of this Chamber.  I am aware of the situation, as Senator Boyhan will know.  I hope the Senator will agree with me that there is an obligation on Cork County Council to respond to the members not named by the Senator but referred to in terms of the number of people involved.  There is an impasse between the Department and Cork County Council.  It is unacceptable that elected members are caught up in this impasse and are being torn between two particular arms of local government, be that the Department or County Hall.  I call on the Minister to direct Cork County Council to engage.  The impasse is unacceptable.  Many of the members in question have given decades of service to their constituents and local government and they have enhanced local government in the city and county of Cork.  <\/p><p>Senator Lawlor made reference to the issue of the Irish language in the junior certificate curriculum.  The trial sample paper published was agreed by a variety of bodies.  We have seen a more organic view being taken of Irish in terms of its usage in the oral part of the examination and class-based assessment.  Earlier, we were joking about Peig Sayers.  We have moved a long way from the days of Peig to a more grounded version of Irish being taught, where the emphasis is on comhr&aacute; - conversation - and the spoken language.  It is important that we get this right.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House for a debate on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#DD01800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Poor old Peig Sayers gets a very bad rap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#EE00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I enjoyed reading <i>Peig<\/i>.

It is accepted that all media, whether public service broadcasters or other local and national media, are experiencing profound financial challenges as the public and consequently commercial advertising revenues move away from traditional linear TV schedules towards content streaming services and social media.  In the past, improvements in economic growth would have generated an increase in commercial revenues through advertising but this is no longer the case due to the shift towards digital advertising, of which Google and Facebook absorb an estimated 73% of revenue.  RT&Eacute; continues to face myriad national and international competitors, many of which are resourced to produce high-quality content and compete for premium content.  In the advertising market, the challenge of UK opt-out channels remains, and there is an ongoing impact due to uncertainty on advertising spend caused due to Brexit.<\/p> <p>These trends, alongside evasion rates and challenges relating to the TV licensing model, are having a critical impact on RT&Eacute;'s revenue and financial sustainability.  Operating losses have been recorded in each of the last four years.  RT&Eacute; has been unable to grow its commercial revenue since 2014 while its costs have grown by &euro;28 million.  While revenue from the TV licence increased by &euro;10 million over the same period, RT&Eacute;'s financial position has deteriorated.<\/p> <p>In submitting its revised strategy, RT&Eacute; has sought assistance and additional support from the Government.  In August, the Government accepted the recommendations of the working group on the future funding of public service broadcasting for reform of TV licence collection.  In line with the recommendations, TV licence fee collection will be put out to tender when the enabling legislation, the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019, is enacted.  This recently passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  An amendment to the current legislation is required to allow a collection agent to be appointed by way of public tender and this will be brought forward on Committee Stage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2432\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2432&amp;amp;pid=SeanCanney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The working group's report suggests competitive tendering for licence fee collection has the potential to bring greater efficiency and effectiveness and thereby improve compliance.  A five year contract for the service will be put in place, allowing the successful bidder the opportunity and incentive to invest in the system of collection and reduce the evasion level from its current rate.  The Government has also agreed that at the end of the five year contract period, the licence fee should be replaced by a device independent broadcasting charge which would take account of technological change and enable the sustainable funding of public service content in the long term.  It is estimated that 10% of homes access content on alternative devices for which one does not require a television licence under the current regime.<\/p><p>RT&Eacute; is funded by a combination of licence fee income and commercial revenue.  The only element of Exchequer funding is that which comes from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for free television licences.  The recent budget was drawn up against the background of a hard Brexit, with the consequence that the Government was constrained in the choices it could make.  RT&Eacute; management has submitted its proposals which we are in the process of evaluating.  As has been widely reported, the proposals involve reducing costs by &euro;60 million over three years, reducing staff costs and staff numbers by approximately 200 next year.  Service changes include the closure of the current studio in Limerick, although Lyric FM and a mid-west news service will be maintained.<\/p><p>The board and management have acknowledged the need for RT&Eacute; to transform itself and address the challenges it faces to bring financial stability and continue to fulfil its role in the long term.  There is no doubt that it will be extremely difficult and that RT&Eacute; will need to balance staffing and cost reductions with the need to satisfy the demands of audiences and operational requirements.  The board engaged external assistance to consider the strategy and has also met the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  NewERA was asked to consider the financial implications of the revised strategy and prepare a report, which has been received and is being assessed by the Department.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, met the chairperson and the director general earlier this year, as well as a delegation from the board in October to listen to its proposals.  He will continue to engage with RT&Eacute; on its proposals.  Broadcasting legislation provides a role for the Minister where there is a variation in channels or new channels are being introduced, but, ultimately, operational decisions are matters for the board and management of RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; is committed to discussing the impact of the changes with those directly affected via their unions.  The organisation recognises, however, that it must be financially viable, while also developing a strategy that will reposition it to take up opportunities in a rapidly changing media world.<\/p><p>In budget 2019 the Minister secured an increase in overall public funding for broadcasting of &euro;9.245 million, comprising the replacement of TG4's share of licence fee income of &euro;4.245 million with Exchequer funding and a &euro;5 million increase in the amount paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for television licences.  RT&Eacute; is receiving &euro;8.6 million of the increased allocation in 2019.  It builds on the increase in Exchequer funding for broadcasting in 2018, funded through a &euro;1.64 million increase in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's contribution for free television licences.  In total, RT&Eacute; has received an increase of &euro;10 million in Exchequer funding in the past two years.  TG4 was allocated an additional &euro;443,000 in Exchequer funding in 2019, in addition to the additional &euro;2 million in current and capital funding it received in 2018, bringing the total increase since the start of the five year period to &euro;2.443 million.  It was also allocated a once-off capital grant of &euro;985,000 in 2018 to cover its expenditure in Bliain na Gaeilge.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to supporting other broadcasters and independent producers.  The Sound and Vision scheme which is financed by 7% of television licence fee receipts and administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland assists in the funding of high quality programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, as well as programmes to improve adult literacy.  It also funds the archiving scheme to preserve Ireland's broadcasting heritage and benefits the broadcasting sector as a whole by supporting independent production.  In its latest funding awards made in March &euro;5.738 million was awarded to 119 radio and television projects under the scheme.  A sum of &euro;5.1 million was awarded for 29 television projects, while 90 radio projects will receive &euro;633,000.  The Government recognises the profound challenges facing both commercial and public service broadcasters and is committed to charting a sustainable future for the sector as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#JJ01900","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Senator Leyden, who, unfortunately, is out of the country but who would have liked to be here to speak about an issue in his brief.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, is not normally responsible for dealing with broadcasting matters and is probably covering for the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  We understand Ministers are often not available, but it is unfortunate that the Minister is not here.  I ask the Minister of State not to take it personally as being against him since the matter being discussed is certainly not within his remit.  At the conclusion of his statement he referred to funding for radio stations, while most of his contribution was related to RT&Eacute;, even though the topic we are discussing is statements on public service broadcasting which includes other broadcasters such as TV3 or Virgin Media, as it is now calls itself, in the context of their news and current affairs content.  How is it that Virgin Media is able to have an hour-long current affairs programme every night at a time when it does not seem to be within the capacity or willingness of RT&Eacute; to do so?  Perhaps it is a judgment call it has had to make.  I read a comment made in the newspaper at the weekend.  Catherine Fulvio had flown to and back from Portugal where she had learned how to cook something in Portugal.  Perhaps that is an issue.<\/p> <p>RT&Eacute; is an important part of Irish life.  Its news, sport and radio programming are important to people.  Most of us will, at some point in the day, listen to it, whether to \"Morning Ireland\", \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\", Ryan Tubridy, Ray D'Arcy, Ronan Collins and so on.  Lyric FM is a very popular station in many houses with which I am familiar.  Many of us rely on RT&Eacute;'s website for factual information and news content that is, regardless of how we may sometimes perceive it in these Houses, far more neutral and less biased than that to be found on many of the news websites one might see in other jurisdictions.  <\/p> <p>It is worth commenting on RT&Eacute;'s archives which are both useful and interesting.  Information on them pops up every so often.  They are a window into what was happening in Irish society ten, 20 or 50 years ago.  <\/p> <p>I do not want to go back over all of what was included in the Minister's statement on the RT&Eacute; 2024 document which I have in front of me and was emailed to all of us.  It outlines how RT&Eacute; is funded, how it has to change, for what it should stand and so on.  It is an important document which outlines a strategy for RT&Eacute;.  I know that members of the board have waived their fees and that we will see pay cuts and job losses which are unfortunate in any organisation.  RT&Eacute; has generally enriched Irish life.<\/p> <p>It is nothing personal against the Minister of State, but it seems that the Government has kicked the can down the road on the issue of the television licence fee and how we should examine how we should collect it and whom we should charge for it.  I understand hotels and even prisons are paying very small amounts, with there being only one licence fee to be paid for those buildings.  I stand to be corrected, but I do not think they are paying a licence fee per television set.  It is the same in households, but in a household there will not be more than three or four at most.  There will certainly not be 200 or 300.  Therefore, the charging mechanism needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>We will probably not receive a response on this issue today because the debate is to be adjourned at 6.15 p.m.  However, if I am right and the debate is to be resumed the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will be here on the next occasion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> It is important we examine why RT&Eacute; is finding it so difficult, in conjunction with An Post, to collect the TV licence fee and why an estimated &euro;35 million to &euro;50 million per year is lost to the TV licence revenue fund, the bulk of which goes to RT&Eacute;.  Sky Sports and Sky Movies are able to implement mechanisms whereby they charge by subscription.  They scramble the signal.  If people want those channels, they pay for them.  They get a code, a card or whatever it is in a box.  Sky knows who they are and they receive the signal.  If they do not pay for it, they do not receive it any more.  I would be interested to know whether RT&Eacute; has the ability or a willingness to charge for its content such that if people want it, they pay for it and RT&Eacute; sees how they get on with it.  This is perhaps not the normal public service model, but we seem to have one of the worst collection rates in Europe, per RT&Eacute;'s 2024 document.  It states that collection in Italy transferred to electricity suppliers and it was possible for the fee to be reduced by 20% and evasion fell hugely.  The document further states that in Denmark the licence fee will be phased out to become a public service tax via the state budget, in Norway it is the same, and in the UK the fee extends to BBC iPlayer.  Should people be able to watch RT&Eacute; Player without having some kind of verification?  I cannot watch BBC iPlayer if I am in a different jurisdiction from the UK.  People outside this country cannot watch the programmes on RT&Eacute; Player other than the specific ones that have worldwide distribution.  There is a way of blocking the signal and blocking people from watching content if one wants to do so.  Perhaps we could have a TV licence system whereby one is allowed up to three or four television sets, broadcast devices or whatever one wants to call them per licence and then, if one watches content on an online player, an iPad or one's household television, if one has one, that is covered with the two or three other devices.  Such a system would mean that people who do not pay will not be able to watch the service.  I do not think any of us who pays the TV licence expects a whole load of other people availing of the service not to pay for it.  It is no different from getting on a train or a bus and not paying one's fare; the rest of us ultimately pick up the tab.  If everyone paid the fee, I do not think we would have this issue.  In fact, we could probably drop the fee per household if all of us paid our fair share.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, will go back to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, I presume, with a transcript of what has been said here today.  As a party, Fianna F&aacute;il is very supportive of public service broadcasting, despite the fact that public service broadcasting may not always have been kind to Fianna F&aacute;il or indeed anyone else in this House.  Nonetheless we value the importance and usefulness of having reliable current affairs programming, reliable and timely sports information and so on.<\/p><p>The Government has been slow to recognise that, as we all know, Google and Facebook are sucking up a lot of advertising revenue.  Brexit, which the Minister of State mentioned in his speech, has played a part in reducing revenues, and over time, to be fair to RT&Eacute;, it has cut its costs by 23%, per its figures from 2008.  It has had challenges with RT&Eacute; Player in that it does not behave in the way in which many people would like it to behave.  It has streaming issues and cuts out and so on.  Many people have expressed frustration about this, but if they are not paying for it and they are getting a service, I am not sure they can be too frustrated.<\/p><p>I am glad that Lyric FM has been saved but I am sorry that Limerick has been the loser in that regard.  We spend most of our time in this Chamber saying there is too much focus on Dublin, too much activity in Dublin, too many people in Dublin, a housing and schools shortage in Dublin and so on.  However, rather than moving some jobs from Dublin to Limerick or from Dublin to Cork, the suggestion is that we do the opposite and move the jobs from a small area, Senator Byrne's area of Limerick, to both Dublin and Cork.  I would like to know from the Minister of State the savings involved in this regard.  There will still need to be a mid-western correspondent and there will still be some presence down there.  However, this Government has been very slow to deal with the TV licence and to face up to the fact that TV3 cut jobs and Independent News &amp;amp; Media and local radio stations have also had issues.<\/p><p>I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response.  I thank him for being here.  It is a useful and a very important debate.  We need to face up to the fact that the TV licence needs to be structured in such a way that we get up to 99% or 100% compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#KK00200","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.

I have asked that the Minister come before the House for a debate on RT&Eacute; and public broadcasting on three occasions going back to November 2017.  It is frustrating that it took so long to get a Minister here, but sin sc&eacute;al eile.<\/p><p>I served on the board of RT&Eacute; for two years before coming into the Seanad.  It was a privilege to work on the board and under its chair, Moya Doherty, and the team that was there.  They are very committed people.  Having said that, RT&Eacute; needs to be made fit for purpose, which it is not at present.  My colleague, Senator Horkan, made the point about the licence fee very clearly and very well.  RT&Eacute; has been beating the drum for probably 20 years or more, asking why it does not get the licence fee it is due.  Roughly 13% or 14% of those who should pay do not pay; 86% or 87% pay.  What it is about Ireland?  How is it that it is always the same people who pay and in many cases the same people who do not pay?  One is penalised for compliance, and now we are looking at giving more money to RT&Eacute;.  I am not saying I am against this, but who is paying the money in?  It is the same taxpayers.  We must create equity for the majority of people - 87% - and RT&Eacute;, in fairness to it, has been crying out for that.  That 13% amounts to roughly &euro;25 million per year.  In 2018, RT&Eacute; lost &euro;13 million.  It would have a profit of &euro;12 million even the way it is if the whole lot were collected.  I believe that compliance in the UK is something like 98%.  I am delighted the Minister of State said in his statement that, based on this legislation, there will be a collection process and that it is going out to tender.  At present An Post delivers that service at a cost, I believe, of roughly &euro;12 million per year, which is quite significant.  I could be corrected slightly on that because it is difficult to get real, good, accurate, evidence-based information.<\/p><p>I will share a few thoughts on RT&Eacute;'s income and expenditure.  In 2015 its commercial income was &euro;155 million.  This represents a fall of &euro;1.5 million on the figure for last year.  Licence fee revenue in 2015 was &euro;178 million and has risen to &euro;189 million.  Total income in 2018 was almost &euro;340 million, and RT&Eacute; made a loss of &euro;13 million in the same year.  As I said, if it got that &euro;25 million in licence fee revenue in, it would be in profit.  It is important to state that RT&Eacute; does not get all the licence fee revenue, but it does get the bulk of it.  I am also told that Lyric FM costs approximately &euro;500,000.  Lyric FM is a very important flagship for the people of Limerick.  I am not from Limerick but I can fully associate with the people of Limerick when they say they need that flagship there.  One of RT&Eacute;'s key <i>raisons d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>or mandates is to go out into the regions rather than retreat into Donnybrook.  The RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra costs, I believe, approximately &euro;4 million per year.  That has been reshaped to some degree as well.  That was landed on RT&Eacute;'s lap a good few years ago by the Government of the day, which said, &quot;Ye deal with it.&quot;  RT&Eacute; was not given extra funding for it.  It is a national orchestra.  It is for the benefit of the Irish people, culturally and otherwise.  That needs to be looked at and properly supported.  The sale of land in 2017 was, I believe, worth approximately &euro;110 million.  I do not know what is happening to that income.  Is it going back into the State coffers or being used by RT&Eacute; to help it to right-size its business model?<\/p><p>To respond to a point made by my colleague, Senator Horkan, in 2017 roughly 65% of households had signed up for pay TV in Ireland.  That tells us something.  I am speaking from memory, but I think RT&Eacute;'s viewership share is approximately 32% to 35%.  If it keeps going the way it is going, which is the last thing I would like to happen, that will fall to 20% or less.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2482\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2482&amp;amp;pid=PadraigOCeidigh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The national broadcaster is absolutely integral and critically important for us both as a society and as a country.<\/p><p>I cannot understand how RT&Eacute; is not making a decent profit.  I will give a few examples of the 2018 profits of some other State and semi-State bodies.  Dublin Port had an income of &euro;90 million and made a profit of &euro;47 million with 163 staff.  ESB Networks brought in &euro;1.5 billion and made &euro;355 million profit with 3,440 staff.  The Irish Aviation Authority had a turnover of nearly &euro;200 million and made a profit of &euro;32 million with 685 staff.  Dublin Airport had a &euro;900 million turnover and made &euro;133 million profit.  Coillte has a turnover of &euro;330 million, which is similar to RT&Eacute;'s &euro;340 million, and last year it made &euro;162 million profit.  Who says State bodies and agencies cannot make a profit?  They can and do, and we are very proud of that.  RT&Eacute; could and should be making a profit.  There has never been as much demand for information, TV, and so on as there is at the moment.  RT&Eacute; can have a captive audience.  It would not be complicated to rightsize it, and there is a bit of rightsizing to be done.  While RT&Eacute; has internal issues and problems, 100% collection on the licence fee is critically important.<\/p><p>Advertising is another issue, on which it was very difficult to find information.  My understanding is that RT&Eacute; is allowed nine or ten minutes of advertising per hour, and uses about six of them.  Private broadcasters have approximately 18 minutes of advertising an hour. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#LL00200","speaker":"1431","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":297,"content":"<p>That is double.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#MM00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>It is double.  I ask the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to lead on this issue.  If the Government extended the amount of advertising allowed to RT&Eacute;, it could increase the revenue by between &euro;25 million and &euro;50 million a year.  That would restructure it.<\/p> <p>This next point is my most important one and I ask the Minister of State to impress it on the Government.  I am very concerned about local radio.  Local radio stations also have a public broadcasting remit within our legislation with which they must comply.  We must provide them with some of the licence fee being collected, as they are not getting a penny of it.  They provide a critically important public broadcasting service to me, to the Minister of State and to people in Dublin, Limerick and all over the country.  We need to create some form of equity because the current set-up is anti-competitive and unfair.  We should press the button on that, not next year but the year after, and give them fairness because they are seriously struggling and are working off peanuts in many cases.  I hope the Minister of State actions some of the points I have made.  We are all on the same page here as we all want a strong public broadcaster.<\/p> <p>There are great people working in RT&Eacute;.  I am concerned about the staffing, and about the SMEs that provide production services and so on to RT&Eacute;.  What will happen to them?  Will they lose out again?  They have lost out significantly in the past.  There are a few thousand of those, mainly around Dublin but also around the country.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#MM00300","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome here today.  It is important to have this debate and I am delighted that it has been put on the agenda.  It is unfortunate that we will not be able to finish it today because it is such an important issue.  The proposed cutbacks at RT&Eacute; were first leaked on \"Prime Time\" not long ago.  I will focus on the situation at Lyric FM, as I am from Limerick and the area means much to me.<\/p> <p>I agree with all that has been said about RT&Eacute; already.  We need to find ways of streamlining it and making it more cost-efficient.  I encourage the Minister of State, the Minister and everybody else to work on that.  Mentors, or some other outside company, might have to come in and work with RT&Eacute; management and help it come up with new ideas.<\/p> <p>I have gone back over some recent newspaper articles, particularly those relating to Lyric FM.  A number of years ago, Lyric FM lost half its staff.  It now has 20 permanent and five part-time staff.  This is not just about the lives of 25 people; it is also about their families because many of them have homes in Limerick, and their children attend local schools and so on.  The proposed closure of the Limerick studio would therefore have a knock-on effect on 50 or 60 people.<\/p> <p>While it has been suggested that something will put in place for the news correspondent, it will be like a kiosk.  At the moment, if other stations, such as RT&Eacute; Radio 1 or RT&Eacute; 2FM, need to broadcast from Limerick, they use the facilities at the Lyric FM studio for both television and radio.  The proposed kiosk might facilitate one or two people but will not be a studio.  There are many purpose-built studios in Limerick, including ones in Limerick Institute of Technology, the University of Limerick, UL, Mary Immaculate College and Troy Studios.  There are many cultural aspects on offer in Limerick.  I was delighted that, at a special meeting of the council last week, it was suggested that the council would lead in putting it up to RT&Eacute;.  It was also suggested that it would bring onboard the third level institutes and business people, and that we would fight the proposed closure of Lyric FM in Limerick as a group.  The staff in Lyric FM will not feel they are on their own, which is important.  People have been supportive of them, not only in the mid west, but nationally as well.  A briefing with the staff of Lyric FM was held in Leinster House today, at which it was great to see support from both across parties and across the country.  It was a boost for the staff to see people coming out and supporting them.<\/p> <p>Culture is very much part of our heritage in Limerick, in the mid-west and in Ireland.  Lyric FM provided that offering of culture.  While it is proposed to disperse the station between Cork and Dublin, it will not be the same thing.  Lyric FM built up cultural links in Limerick with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, choirs and different groups, many of which came from around the country to perform at the station.  It worked in co-operation with many cultural groups.  Those links took a long time to put together and it will now be very hard to keep them going.  It is equally hard on the staff.<\/p> <p>I understand that RT&Eacute; has to find a way of cutting costs.  However, UL, which will be joined by the local authority and other groups in Limerick, has made a proposal to allow it to use the Lyric FM facilities.  That proposal must be taken seriously by RT&Eacute;, but UL has not received any response to date.  It costs &euro;800 to run each programme on Lyric FM, while it costs on average &euro;1,400 an hour for each of the other stations.  There is a big cost difference there. <\/p> <p>The Irish Chamber Orchestra hosted an event in the University of Limerick last Thursday evening and people from different choirs and cultural organisations came out in full force just to say they stand with Lyric FM.  I do not believe the proposal to close Lyric FM only came up in the past 12 months.  The cultural CEO of RT&Eacute; has never even set foot in the Lyric FM offices in Limerick, which sends out a message in its own right.  RT&Eacute; will make proposals about cutbacks, the unions and so on but as there is such a huge groundswell of support for the staff, it is important that we also work with them, both cross-party and cross-county.  We must come up with proposals, not only for saving Lyric FM in Limerick but for cost-saving measures as well.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maria Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Dee Forbes stated, in an article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>in September of this year, that she had proposed moving Lyric FM to Carraroe in County Galway and I am sure Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh would have been pleased to hear that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#MM00400","speaker":"1384","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>More than welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#NN00200","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>-----but that the board did not think it was going to be viable.  It is disappointing that there has not been any communication and that the staff in Lyric FM heard about this through Twitter, an email and \"Prime Time\".  That was sad.  Lyric FM has been in Limerick for the past 20 years and that was an awful way for the staff to find out that their jobs were in jeopardy.  They may have the option of moving to Cork and Dublin but we must also consider climate change.  Are they all going to pile into cars and drive up and down the road or will they use public transport?  It is not going to be viable for the staff so there are going to be job losses.  They are looking for 200 to 300 voluntary redundancies across RT&Eacute;.  Maybe Lyric FM should have been given the option of being part of those voluntary redundancies.  I should refer to Lyric FM in Limerick, rather than Lyric FM, because the station is not closing, it is just moving to Cork and Dublin.<\/p> <p>I feel strongly about this and I appeal to the Minister of State and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to get involved in this because people's jobs are in jeopardy here and there will be knock-on effects.  Culture is strong in Ireland.  Galway will be the European city of culture next year and Limerick was the national city of culture.  There are so many cultural organisations, located in every town, village and city in Ireland.  This is only the start.  If Lyric FM is being dispersed to Cork and Dublin, is RT&Eacute; trying to close it down in the long term?  I firmly believe RT&Eacute; was going to close it down originally but that when RT&Eacute; saw people were supportive of Lyric FM, it said it would move the station to Cork and Dublin.  RT&Eacute; has drawn a circle.  It is looking to keep Lyric FM in Dublin and Cork and do away with the mid-west.<\/p> <p>Senators Horkan and &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh referred to balanced regional development, which this is going against.

I want to be very direct in the next point and I accept the good wishes and goodwill of everyone in terms of keeping Lyric FM in Limerick.  This is a political decision in the first instance by RT&Eacute; to close down Lyric FM in Limerick.  As the trade union representative for those workers said to us this morning, Lyric FM is Limerick, as 80% of the station's output comes from Limerick.  People have invested in Limerick and built lives there.<\/p> <p>We need the Minister to make a political decision and what disappoints me is that, during a Commencement debate last week, the Minister said something I had never heard him say before.  He said he was not across the detail of this proposal.  I disagree with the Minister on many things but I salute him that, whenever he comes into this Chamber, he is across every aspect and detail of his brief and always has been but that is what he said last week.<\/p> <p>The Minister went on to say that this does not appear to be within his remit.  He gave the same answer in the D&aacute;il last week.  I am extremely concerned that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment seems to think he can fold his arms and accept that Lyric FM will close in Limerick.  I am here to say, on behalf of all the people of Limerick, we will never accept the closure of our national station.  Fine Gael will never be forgiven and it will never be forgotten if Lyric FM closes under its watch; that cannot be allowed to happen.  It makes no sense from a financial perspective.<\/p> <p>I asked the staff of Lyric FM this morning if consideration was given to moving people out of Dublin to the cheaper location of Limerick.  It is amazing that the Lyric FM staff have not been given any of the financial details behind these decisions.  They are still in the dark.  We heard that, horrifically, they found out through the media about the plans for the station but they still do not actually know any of the financial data behind these decisions.  As a Member noted in the D&aacute;il last week, the Minister appears to be uninterested.  That is also my impression and it is not good enough.  <\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in's position is very clear on this: we will lead a campaign to keep Lyric FM  in Limerick.

It is extremely concerning for the regions in which people rely on the service to save lives.  It will put pressure on this vital service which is used to transfer critically ill persons in need of urgent medical care.  The emergency aeromedical service which has operated out of Custume Barracks in Athlone since 2013 has been one of the services hardest hit by the recruitment and retention crisis which is affecting the Defence Forces, into which I do not intend to go in any great detail as we are discussing a specific matter.<\/p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to, please, look at the crisis.  I understand he has known about it since 2015, following the workplace climate survey conducted by the University of Limerick and departmental reports that indicated an apparent lack of operational experience and mentoring and supervision in the Air Corps.  Unfortunately, instead of moving back from the brink in dealing with the retention crisis in the Air Corps, the Minister of State has ignored the red flags, which has resulted in operational capacity going over the cliff edge, with contagion to other services.

Given that senior officers are being deployed to Athlone from Baldonnel, what assurances can the Minister of State give that there is proper supervision in the home base in Baldonnel of the people they will leave behind when they move to Athlone to take over flying duties?  Will the Minister of State explain why we are not paying the senior officers who put their lives at risk in carrying out emergency flights all over the country which, as he has pointed out, have been extremely successful the same allowance as other pilots?  Will he give me an assurance that they will receive the same allowances as every other pilot who flies, regardless of rank?  If they are in the air, they should receive their allowances.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State adverted to the recommissioning of pilots.

I referred earlier to the 159 car accidents that had occurred and 15 seriously ill children.  Councillor John Dolan from Athlone was lifted by an air ambulance.

The top Army official has put the blame for the cutbacks in the air ambulance service such that the service will be withdrawn for 16 days this winter squarely on the Minister of State and the Taoiseach.  Incentives were put in place to entice pilots to stay in the Air Corps but it is clear that they have not worked.  This is not a new problem.  As other Senators mentioned, it goes back to 2015.  The issues of recruitment and retention in the health service and the Air Corps have been staring us in the face, but there has been no planning.  We have lost much organisational experience which cannot be passed on to the younger people who may have taken over, although they are few and far between.  It is disappointing that, like many other sectors, air ambulance services will be dependent on charity.  The Irish Community Rapid Response does an excellent job and will step in with its helicopter.<\/p> <p>In June 2018, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, asked the Minister of State about the then recent decision to grant a contract worth &euro;7 million for night time ambulance services to a commercial company.  The Minister of State acknowledged that capacity constraints within the Air Corps impacted on the services it provided, including services to the HSE.  Obviously, there was a service level agreement with the HSE and the Minister of State was of the opinion it could not be met, so the service provision went to a commercial company.<\/p> <p>In April 2018, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh tabled a question asking whether there was capacity within the Air Corps to go beyond the services it was supplying.  He was asking about growth and investment in the area.  It is a poor reflection on the management of the Defence Forces that the Air Corps is unable to retain pilots, air traffic controllers or those who could operate the equipment or aeroplanes.  When Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh visited Baldonnel, he saw equipment sitting in hangars at night because insufficient cover was available.  In his reply, the Minister of State stated that it would not be possible for the Air Corps to deliver the requirement sought by the HSE and confirmed that his Department did not tender for the service because of a lack of substance.  He stated that he had a pathway to address the issues and had made a submission regarding pilot retention to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Service Pay Commission.  Obviously, that submission fell on deaf ears, given that we are in this situation which has recently been revealed.<\/p> <p>What is being done to recruit, retain, attract and train pilots and the required ancillary staff, including paramedics?  Is it being done with gusto or is there a shake of the head or shrug of the shoulders and an admission that we cannot do it?  Is there a plan for the future?  What pathway does the Minister of State propose?<\/p> <p>The public and all present are well aware of the issues of recruitment and retention.  I am particularly aware of such issues in the health service.  The little that is being done falls far short of what is needed.  I refer to the exodus of medics, particularly nurses, which had been predicted to occur as a result of the chaos of working in the health service.  The fewer staff one works with, the less inclined one is to remain in the job, given the increase in workplace stress.  The issue of the two hours which nurses work for free has not been addressed.  The exodus of pilots and support staff was predicted but nothing was done.  I hope the Minister of State can provide clarity and comfort to those in the Air Corps, as well as those who depend on the air ambulance service in emergency situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#PP00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  I wish to pay tribute to the Air Corps and the air ambulance service.  They do the State significant service in difficult conditions.  As noted by other Senators, many people walking around today would not be with us if it were not for the air ambulance service.  I acknowledge the remarks of Senator Feighan on Roscommon and the excellent air ambulance service provided there.<\/p> <p>We need a longer discussion on this matter.  There is a basic level of service which the citizens of Ireland deserve.  We owe them an integrated plan.  A very interesting report on the successfulness of operations carried out by the HSE was published earlier this week.  When a surgeon performs an operation at least 12 times per year, outcomes are far better and the patients have better chance of recovery and fewer complications.  That holds true at various levels of expertise.  I raised the issue of cancer outcomes on the Order of Business.  It has been proven that centres of excellence provide better outcomes for cancer patients, those who have had a stroke and those undergoing an operation.  If we wish for the public to have confidence in our services, they must know that they can be transported from their location to a hospital in a certain amount of time, whether by ambulance or helicopter.<\/p> <p>I admire the Irish Community Rapid Response and the service provided by its charity helicopter.  However, one must ask why it is necessary for a charity to provide that service.  This is about the provision of a minimum standard.  We must decide what that minimum standard is for those living in Donegal, Kerry, Roscommon, Mayo or elsewhere.  It is that a very quick response commensurate with the seriousness of one's illness or accident is provided, whether by ambulance or helicopter.  We need to sit down and see how to achieve that.<\/p> <p>I will not be highly critical of any one service or Minister.  The Sl&aacute;intecare plan involves the roll-out of local services.  Those who require the services of an acute hospital must be able to access it quickly and efficiently and that service must be provided by the State.  A rapid response helicopter service provided by the Air Corps must be adequately resourced.  Its staff must not be pulled off other duties but, rather, be dedicated to the service.  There must be a sufficient staffing level.  As we roll out Sl&aacute;intecare and the centres of excellence, the public can have confidence that they will have rapid access to emergency services.  I believe that is also the wish of the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>In the dying days of this Government - I do not mean that in any nasty sense - there may be an opportunity to discuss the minimum level of service which we can guarantee, and then provide it.  It should be provided by the State.  We should not have to depend on the collection box and the good intentions and actions of members of the public who fundraise.  We must tell citizens that there is a minimum threshold which we can and will provide.  That is what they need and deserve.  If this discussion kicks off that debate, this will have been time well spent.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Minister of State for attending.

I know how important this was.  Before we had this service hundreds of people died unnecessarily.  Due to the joined-up thinking of the Defence Forces and the Department of Health, working with the National Ambulance Service and advanced paramedics, this has been a wonderful service and I hope that we can iron out these issues on a cross-party basis to continue to provide this service.  I would love this service to be provided not just in Cork and Athlone but across the island, bringing in our friends in Northern Ireland.  We can do that, cross-Border and throughout the country.

There will be four days in the months of November, December, January and February when the EAS Air Corps will not be able to provide a service.  When it is unable to provide a service, the community response helicopter will be in place and will be backed up by the Irish Coast Guard.  The then Government put this in place in 2015 in line with the decision to establish the emergency air medical service when it said that if it us unable to accept taskings, the Irish Coast Guard will provide cover to the National Ambulance Service.  People were looking for this service for as long as I can remember.  The Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government in 2011 introduced this service and a memorandum of understanding was drawn up between the Air Corps, Defence Forces, Department of Defence, HSE and Department of Health.  It was put in place in 2012 on a trial basis.  It was successful in the intervening years and was put on a full-time permanent footing in 2015.<\/p> <p>The most important issue is the safety of the people providing the service, including the pilots, Air Corps personnel, and the emergency services staff and patients on board.  I could be mistaken but I am not sure that one Member mentioned that.

However, I have always stated to military management the importance of the safety of personnel in all areas of its work.  It would be totally remiss of me if I did not take my responsibility seriously and think of the safety of personnel.  When this came to my attention, I first engaged with the Departments of Health and Defence, the HSE, Air Corps, and military management.  Following a recommendation that came out of those talks, we decided to approach the ICRR.  We became aware that it had a second helicopter that was not in use.  We asked it to provide assistance and it was confirmed to us that it would be able to provide assistance. <\/p> <p>People might ask why this time of the year.  There is a simple reason.  Daylight hours are at their shortest and the statistics from recent years show that this is one of the quietest times, when we are least able to fly because of inclement weather conditions, including rain, wind, fog or whatever.  A decision was made to do it because it would have the least impact on the citizens that I believed would be affected.  Now that the ICRR is in place, this service will be as good as the service in the past.  The only difference is the colour of the helicopter and, without being flippant, I do not think anyone will question that. <\/p> <p>It will be based in Roscommon.  If anybody has any understanding, they will know why it is not based at Custume Barracks in Athlone.  That is a military installation.  I confirm to the House the next four months expire, on 1 March 2020, this service will be back on a permanent footing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paul Kehoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have never hidden behind the fact that we have challenges when it comes to pilots.  That is one of the reasons that we asked the independent pay commission to look at the service commitment of the pilots, which was abolished back in 2008, and not by a Fine Gael-led Government, because of the economic downturn the country was going through at that time.  The independent pay commission recommended that the service commitment scheme would be reintroduced and it has been under the high-level implementation plan that was put in place by the Government.<\/p><p>A question was asked about the EAS allowance.  A claim had been made by the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO.  That is being dealt with in the appropriate channels and it would be improper of me to comment on that here tonight because it is going through the appropriate channels.  On all occasions, I have taken the military advice I have received.  This is a temporary interruption and will be limited to four days per month over a period of four months.  The EAS will continue and actions being taken now will ensure the long-term viability of the EAS provided by the Air Corps.  I want to be very clear that the whole focus is returning the EAS to full capacity.  The loss of 16 days of the EAS is regrettable, as I have stated, but it is necessary from the perspective of safety and governance.  <\/p><p>There will be a training surge for new and additional pilots to service the EAS.  We have the contingency plan in place with the ICRR and the Irish Coast Guard, which will co-operate fully with the National Ambulance Service.  Two officers have recently been recommissioned.  I am absolutely delighted that those people have come back in from the private sector and want to come back in as pilots with the Air Corps.  People would accept that, of course, those two pilots who have come back in must undergo training and that is ongoing at the moment.  I do not think anybody would accept that someone who is recommissioned in the Air Corps would reassume the duties they had six or seven years previously.  That would be irresponsible of military management and the General Officer Commanding, GOC, in the Air Corps.  Training must be gone through for people who have re-entered the Air Corps.<\/p><p>I hope I have outlined the issue.  The most important thing is that lives are not being put at risk.  There is an equally good service with the ICRR as what was provided by the Air Corps.  I commend all the military personnel, pilots, personnel on the planes and paramedics involved with the EAS.  These people have saved lives and will continue to do so.  We are going to reassure the general public that this service will be back up and running from 1 March, except for four days in November, December, January and February.  It would be irresponsible of me if we had taken this action in other months when there would have been longer flying days, better weather and everything like that.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys asked why this service was not being provided at night time.  There are safety reasons and safety concerns about landing, as pilots are aware, that must be taken into account.<\/p><p>It is absolutely fantastic that the ICRR is willing to step up to the plate.  I compliment that organisation.  There is a huge amount of voluntary organisations that run ambulances and helicopters right across Europe, including the UK, Wales, Scotland and all over the place.  There are plenty of examples of them, so we are not unique.  It is great that people appreciate our people and communities coming together to provide this service for the betterment of the people and their communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#QQ01600","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>One question that was not addressed was how we cam guarantee a service when we do not know what pilots are scheduled to leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#RR00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I must ask the Leader to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#RR00300","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>This is an important issue for the public.

In general terms, not too much attention is paid to the close test of the Long Title of a Bill.  On this occasion, it is important because claims have been made for this legislation by one Member of Government that this will take the appointment of judges out of the hands of politicians and hand it to another group.  Of course, constitutionally that is not possible but the claim has been made for the Bill that it has this effect.  The purpose of this amendment is to make it very clear that the function of the judicial appointments commission, once established, is purely advisory.<\/p> <p>There is another reason the amendment is appropriate.  The Bill speaks, at another section, about the function of the commission being to \"select and recommend\" members of the Judiciary.  Of course, there is not a selection of members of the Judiciary by the commission.  The selection of a person to be made a judge is a matter for the Government and not for the commission.  In these circumstances, the Long Title of the Bill should underline the advisory nature of the commission, should make it clear that the claims made for it, as taking the appointment of judges out of the hands of elected politicians are not correct, and to emphasise that, in line with the Constitution, the function of appointing judges remains with the Executive and that any other body, which is involved in the process, can only be advisory and not determinative in any way of the persons appointed to be judges.  It is in that light that I formally move this amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#SS03700","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":378,"content":"<p>We have agreed to take amendments Nos. 1 and 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#SS03800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>If the Chair is ruling that they be taken together-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#SS03900","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Because they are similar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#SS04000","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>-----the same logic applies to the amendment No. 3 in my name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#SS04100","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>It is the same thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#SS04200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":383,"content":"<p>It is not the same thing but it is similar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#SS04300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>It is the same logic.

That position is well understood.  If the Government gets three recommendations, it can choose any or none of them.  Of course, the revised print of section 47 effectively directs the Government to consider the names of those persons who have been recommended but it is quite clear, right through this debate and this Bill, that no recommendation is in any way mandatory.  To that extent, the commission is in no different a position than the advisory board is currently.<\/p> <p>I have another amendment to reinstate the senior judicial appointments advisory committee in the Bill.

They are, of course, slightly different in that amendment No. 3 refers to line 13 of the administrative reprint on page 7, \"To enable, through other procedures, the making of recommendations in respect of appointments to senior judicial offices that do not fall within the remit of the foregoing body\".  The amendment is to insert the word \"advisory\" there.  I take on board the point that the Minister has made that the senior appointments committee is later described as advisory.<\/p> <p>I want to emphasise the following, which is worth emphasising in the context of the overall nature of this commission and what is constitutionally permissible and what is not.  The Minister has just said that the Government is free not to make an appointment on the advice of the commission.  The true situation goes one stage further: the Government is free to make an appointment which is not recommended by the commission.  That is the important point that must be borne in mind.  If there were any doubt about that, the House should have regard to section 51, which appears on page 33 of the administrative reprint.  It states that, \"Where the Government decides to advise the President to appoint any serving judge who is a member of any of the Superior Courts to any vacancy arising in those Courts, the Minister shall notify the Commission of that decision and the Commission shall have no further function in relation to that appointment.\"  <\/p> <p>This is important for the purpose of underlining public understanding of the Bill.  It should be clearly understood that this Bill, as amended on Committee Stage in this House, now not only by silence does not attempt to interfere with the constitutional prerogative of the Executive but section 51 makes it absolutely clear that it is the constitutional prerogative of the Executive to make appointments to the superior courts without the intervention of the commission at all.  The commission can be told that it has no function and the Government is making an appointment of a serving judge to any position in any of those courts.  That is an important philosophical and constitutional value to be emphasised and it is in that light that the two references to the recommendations being advisory are proposed to the Long Title, to make it very clear, lest anybody say at any time in the future that the Government was acting unlawfully or improperly by not accepting the recommendations of the commission, that it was at no point obliged, and could not be obliged, to act on the recommendations of the commission.  <\/p> <p>In that context, I believe that the inclusion of the word \"advisory\" in the two places contemplated by amendment No. 3 is an improvement to the Bill and does not detract from it.  It is more honest than the claims that have been made by people that this Bill takes the appointment of judges away from the elected members of the Government and hands it to the commission.  Those claims were not made by the Minister who has been meticulously honest in acknowledging that what others claim is being done by this Bill is not, in fact, being done.  It should be clearly and unequivocally stated, at every relevant point in the Bill, including in the Long Title, that that is not so.<\/p> <p>It is in that light and spirt that I have proposed amendments Nos. 1 and 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#TT00900","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 1 being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#TT01000","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>It is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#TT01100","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I indicated that I wished to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#TT01200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Unfortunately for Senator Boyhan, Senator McDowell was responding, as was his right.

In my view that is an unwieldy and unnecessarily large group of people and if the number of lay persons appointed under section 10(1)(k) was reduced to four, and the chairperson under 10(1)(j) was permitted to be a lawyer, a judge or a layperson this would be a much more effective commission.  Therefore, what we are proposing here is that for this advisory body, composed in the main of people who are not necessarily experienced in the law, the judicial process or in the way in which individual candidates have functioned as lawyers, solicitors or barristers, the kind of practices they have, to have the lay participants constitute a majority of the commission is in the circumstances unnecessary.  This body is quite capable of functioning with a minority of lay persons on it.

It is very important that the majority of members of a commission of this nature be people with very specific and particular expertise; not just lay members.

It is a comment that equally applies to the position being taken by the Government, driven by the Minister, Deputy Ross, in arguing for a lay majority.  The difficulty is that we do not have provision for the appointment of hospital consultants, for example, by a lay majority.  No one is arguing that a lay majority should appoint hospital consultants.  Quite rightly, there is minority lay representation which ensures integrity, even-handedness and a stake for lay persons in those appointments.  However, the assessment of the professional experience and expertise of medical candidates should be a matter for medical professionals.  That is how we appoint engineers, architects and, indeed, academics.  We need to reflect on the central point on the Bill and the need to ensure that there is lay representation but that it is not a majority.

I like to know that he is the best in his field and that is why he was appointed as a consultant.<\/p> <p>There is something deeply suspicious and almost mean about the drive to have a large number of lay people involved in this massive 17-member commission.  Its size is beyond belief.  The Minister, Deputy Ross has been pushing for a lay majority for a long time.  We probably should have a way to appoint judges which might be perceived to take politics out of it, although we have not been badly served by the Judiciary.  However, it makes no sense to require a majority of lay people.  Lay people sometimes do not understand the intricacies of the law or how judges arrive at their decisions.  One often hears comments ranging from \"hang him\" to \"shoot him\" when a judgment is handed down.  I refer to the extremely complex corporate cases that have come before the courts.  If there is to be a majority of lay people on the commission, will they have to be accountants, actuaries or God knows what other profession?  I do not see the necessity of having a large number of lay people.  The people from the Law Library and the Law Society are well capable of working through, in an open and transparent way, the very difficult process of appointing judges.<\/p> <p>We have addressed the various issues that will arise in the appointment of judges.  On Committee Stage, reference was made to judges of an extremely conservative nature and the point made that if there were too many of them on a particular court one might wish to have less conservative people.  I can imagine a situation whereby all hell breaks loose because the Chief Justice or somebody else tells the commission that there are many conservative judges and we need less conservative candidates.  There would be leaks to newspapers and so on.<\/p> <p>The amendment is perfectly reasonable.  It makes the best of both worlds.  If it is accepted and the Bill is passed, the majority of the commission responsible for the appointment of judges would have expert knowledge and it would be up to them to convince the lay people, rather than having a majority of lay people drawn from God knows where and with God knows what qualifications.  I do not believe that what the Minister, Deputy Ross was looking for would meet the needs of society, although it may meet his needs.

If one is going to propose a minority of lay persons at a later point, and if one is going to propose amendment of the Bill by assiduously removing all the lay majority provisions in it, there is nothing incongruous about having the Long Title of the Bill reflect that state of affairs.  The order in which these things are taken provides that this particular provision has to be taken now.  It cannot be amended at the very end of the debate on Fifth Stage or whatever.<\/p> <p>I remember a famous compromise on barristers' wigs.  They were to be prohibited under the terms of a Bill tendered by one of the Minister's predecessors, Nora Owen, but eventually a compromise was reached where the section that said a barrister shall not wear a ceremonial wig of the kind heretofore worn was amended to say a barrister shall not be obliged to wear a ceremonial wig of the kind heretofore worn.  Most barristers do not wear one, so that was the end of that.  The curious anomaly that arose from all of that was that the acceptance of that amendment at that Stage did not deal with the Long Title of that legislation, which said that one of its purposes was to prohibit the wearing of barristers' wigs.  One has to deal with it in the order that the procedure of this House deals with these matters, and we cannot come back to the Long Title of the Bill having looked at the text again.  One has to be prospective in the amendments that are being proposed.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik pointed out fairly, I think, that there are virtually no parallels on the appointment of persons on the basis of expertise, where a majority of the people appointing, or having a function in the appointment of any kind, are required to be people who do not share that expertise.  There is practically no parallel in any other sphere of life and she pointed to the case of a specialist medical consultant being recommended for appointment to a vacancy in a university teaching hospital and being told that a majority of the people who will make the decision know little or nothing about medicine.

It is excessively large and unwieldy.  No good case has been made for having seven lay people and a chairperson, as envisaged by section 10(1)(j) and (k), constitute a majority of the board, and the number seven is clearly designed simply to outweigh numerically the <i>ex officio <\/i>people who are considered worthy to hold office as members of the commission by reason of their expertise or the office that they hold.<\/p><p>Although the Minister now states it would be a major U-turn for the Government to abandon the idea of a lay majority, I have never heard a good argument made on the record of the D&aacute;il or in this Chamber for having a lay majority.  When I think back on the arguments that have been made about a lay majority, it is that somehow if one had a majority of judges, members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, practising barristers, practising solicitors, the Attorney General and a minority of lay people on this commission, they would in some sense attempt, consciously or unconsciously, to subvert the common good by making choices that would not otherwise be made, that they would be clannish and cliquish and put people onto the Bench, or attempt to have people put on the Bench, who would not deserve to be made judges.  That seems to me to be the only real basis for having a so-called lay majority on the commission, that somehow by making the lay element the majority element, a different type of person will be made a judge.  If one considers that proposition, it suggest that an experienced commission comprising a person appointed by the Law Society, a person appointed by the Bar Council, a member of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and a smaller group of lay people  is more likely to make inferior recommendations to the Government than otherwise.  The logic of that escapes me, and the implausibility of that is apparent when one thinks about it.  It is simply implausible that better judges will be appointed simply by outweighing the number of people who know what they are talking about instinctively with people whose only major qualification is that they are less qualified than the others, by reason of their life experience, to have an input into the appointment of judges.  On that account, I am worried.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik mentioned the definition the Minister has in amendment No. 7, which we have not yet reached.  However, I want to signal now, without being disorderly, I hope, that the change proposed in amendment No. 7, adding in a paragraph (d), is deeply suspicious.  It means that among the lay people we could not have, say, a retired judge from the United Kingdom, France, Northern Ireland, Scotland or from anywhere else.  Such a person would be disqualified, and by the way, because such a person cannot be appointed under any of the other categories, he or she could never serve on the judicial appointments commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#XX00700","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>We will consider that fully when we come to that amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#XX00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":455,"content":"<p>We will come to it.

The purpose of this amendment is to give this House and the other House a second chance after the next election when, it is hoped, the Government will be free of some of its present influences and when the majority of Members of the Houses will be free to express their real views on this legislation, to consider whether they really want this Bill ever to come into operation at all.  I make no bones about this: that is the purpose of the amendment.  It is to give both Houses of the Oireachtas the final say as to whether this proposal should come into law.<\/p> <p>Normally, a commencement section gives to a Minister the right to commence an Act or a portion of an Act for any particular purpose.  It gives to the Minister a discretion to decide when and if it should be commenced and in what parts and for what purposes.  It also gives the Minister the right to postpone the repeal of various enactments or provisions of enactments affected by the commencement section.  This Bill, however, repeals the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board provisions of earlier legislation.  The real question we must ask ourselves is whether, much like the English people in their referendum on Brexit, we should not revisit this at a later stage, when the political circumstances are different.<\/p> <p>I strongly believe for a number of reasons that the Bill should be allowed to be reviewed.  I wish to put on the record, and I hope the Minister will take this in exactly the spirit in which it is offered, my great admiration for the appointments that have been made to the Bench during the period in which the Minister and the current Attorney General and Government have been in office.  They have been good, solid appointments.  They have not suffered from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board procedure.  Without being unduly laudatory of people on the Bench before whom one might appear, I believe that this Government has sustained, without any of this legislative arrangement, a very high standard in the appointment of persons to judicial office.  Really meritorious people have been appointed.  There has been a balance between the types of people appointed.  There has been a gender balance among the people appointed.  All this has been done by a Government without any assistance at all from a commission.<\/p> <p>This provokes the following questions in my mind.  Would better appointments have been made if the proposed commission had been in place?  Would better people have been put on the Bench if the Government had performed its functions over recent years assisted by a commission of this kind?  Not merely is it not proven at all that better appointments would have been made; the likelihood is that the same standard this Government has achieved by operating the existing mechanisms would probably not have been achieved if a majority lay group coming up with different recommendations had been interposed in the whole process.<\/p> <p>I challenge the Minister to make the case as to why what is working very well at the moment should not be left alone.  One of the reasons I make this challenge is not merely that I believe that the cumbersome and complex procedures envisaged in this Bill will deter people from seeking appointment to judicial office or from making themselves available for appointment to judicial office, but also that the expense and complexity of the procedures must be considered.  I ask the House to imagine, for instance, a scenario in which somebody retires from the Supreme Court, somebody from the Court of Appeal takes up the vacant position, and a consequential vacancy occurs in the Court of Appeal, which in all likelihood and in the vast majority of cases will be filled by a judge of the High Court.  Under this legislation, even that chain of events could run to six or nine months.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If I am to believe what I read in the papers, the only obstacle, the only fly in the ointment, in recent times has been the delaying campaign fought by one Minister against judicial appointments being made.  All I can do is rely on the titbits I see in the newspaper concerning objections, the non-filling of positions and the delays in the filling of positions which are attributed to one member of the Cabinet.  Forgetting that aspect for one moment, the delays were inexcusable and should never have been countenanced.  The bluff should have been called, but when the Bill comes into being, the process will be much more cumbersome.  I notice that the Minister has not tabled amendments to deal with the issue.  However, the Bill will delay consequential appointments for a period of three to six months when it is not necessary to do so.  I say this because if an appointment is made to the Supreme Court and a competition held for that purpose, one cannot anticipate the outcome and say there will also be a competition to fill a position in the Court of Appeal because that suggests one is prejudging the outcome and saying somebody will move from that court to the Supreme Court.  Likewise, one cannot anticipate that there will be a vacancy in the Court of Appeal which would warrant appointing a member of the High Court.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned this issue previously, but nothing has been done to deal with it.  It is inevitable that an appointment process to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court will take two or three months for the commission to deal with the matter.  I am not trying to exaggerate it, but two to three months is a fair amount of time to advertise the position, receive all of and consider the applications and assess the process and for the lay majority to conduct interviews and an examination of the records of people about whom they know nothing in such a circumstance.  It would take two to three months to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court if the commission was to be involved in the process at all.  When the decision was made, if it was to involve the promotion of somebody in the Court of Appeal, if we are to follow the<b><\/b>rubric of the Bill, the resulting vacancy would have to be advertised.  The Minister would have to go hunting a second time for a judge, a barrister or a solicitor who wanted to be appointed to the Court of Appeal.  That would process take two or three months to complete.  If the Minister was to decide - in all statistical likelihood it would be the case - to appoint a High Court judge to the position, it would take another two or three months in advertising the vacancy.  Something that could be done in an afternoon because the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, process does not apply to existing members of the Bench, could take nine months to complete.  I cannot understand how any parliament would consciously walk into that trap.<br\/><br\/>It is for that reason that I really believe - I am just using what I said as one example because I could spend the entire night here if the Chair was to permit it, but he will not - that is one glaring hole in the whole process.  It will delay appointments, including consequential appointments to fill consequential vacancies, by a period of six to nine months in the event that there are three movements of judges arising from the filling of one vacancy in the Supreme Court.  That is wrong and it could and should have been avoided.  Perhaps it will be if the Government decides that the Bill will be impracticable in its operation and simply adopts the summary procedure set out in section 51 which is simply to state it will not go to the commission to fill these appointments and that the following three people are to be appointed this afternoon: X to the Supreme Court, Y to the Court of Appeal and Z from the High Court to the Court of Appeal.  As of now that can happen and it is a sensible way to do business.  It means that the courts system works efficiently.<br\/><br\/>My particular objection is combined with my absolute conviction that for a Government which has made well balanced, merit-based appointments without any of this expensive paraphernalia which will cost &euro;500,000 a year, based on the Minister's projections, and involve massive delays, bureaucracy - offices, rent and full-time civil servants to man them - it is completely unnecessary to do this.  Since the Minister in all likelihood will not be making a commencement order before the next general election, before there is a new and different parliament and a new Government-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#BBB00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>That is a threat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#CCC00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>No.  I am saying to you-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#CCC00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Through the Chair, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#CCC00400","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>-----that my observation is not a threat.

The aim of amendment No. 4 in my name is simply to give whoever will be in office after the next general election the opportunity to say if this provision was wise in the first place or the result of the Independent Alliance's insistence on its insertion in the Constitution.  That is the only argument I am making.  We should give the Oireachtas another chance and it is by no means a threat; rather, it is a hope.  I do not believe the Minister will be in a position to commence the Bill in the next six to eight months.  It simply cannot be done.  Perhaps parts of it might be commenced to start the recruitment process if the Minister had a gun to his head, something I do not believe any other Minister would do.  Short of that happening, the commission will not be in operation for another 18 months and there will be a general election before that period elapses.  A different Government with different people - it may be the case that many of the same people will be in it - would arrive at a very different view as to whether the current system is superior to what is involved in the Bill and not waste &euro;500,000 a year of taxpayers' money in establishing this quango and not tie itself in knots in holding interviews, having short lists and all the rest.

I ask the Minister to give the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas the opportunity to reconsider whether to continue with the present system rather than wasting an awful lot of money establishing this quango.

While this kind of resolution is a little unusual, this legislation calls for such a resolution.  The amendment states: &quot;An order made under <i>subsection (2)<\/i>shall not have effect unless a resolution approving the order is passed by each House of the Oireachtas within 28 days of the making of the said order.&quot;  The intention behind this, as I understand it, is to guarantee a degree of oversight by both Houses of the Oireachtas because statutory instruments are often passed on the nod.  It happens on many days in this Seanad without discussion.  This ensures that no such action shall be taken without the supervision and oversight of the Houses.  The idea behind the amendment is to make absolutely certain that a ministerial order commencing any aspect of the legislation is subject to the passing of such a resolution by each House.  This ensures that the commencement order cannot take effect until it has been affirmed by resolution of both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Requiring the passing of a resolution in this way introduces a degree of oversight and supervision from both Houses of the Oireachtas into this situation.  That we should be given a role in this process is a good, democratic principle for us to uphold here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

As he and Senator Norris have said, it is an unusual amendment, but this is an unusual Bill, of which we are all very conscious.  It seems eminently practical to give the Oireachtas another chance to review an order before it can come into effect.  Otherwise it would have an incredibly cumbersome effect on the process of judicial appointment.  I am struck by Senator McDowell's commentary on the judges who have been appointed, both recently and since this Government took office in 2016.  The quality and calibre of judicial appointments is such that one wonders what this new and more cumbersome process would add.  I favour reform and my party supported Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill in the D&aacute;il, but I do not believe this is the appropriate, best or most effective reform possible.  I, my party, and many others in this House have significant difficulties with many aspects of the reform proposed by the Minister.  This is a good compromise proposal.  Even if the Bill is passed before the next election, there would nonetheless be an extra check on its coming into effect, because this amendment would empower the Houses of the Oireachtas to have a say on its commencement.

That being the case, a new Government will be duty-bound to ask whether the commencement of the legislation will really add anything to the quality of the Judiciary by comparison with the current system.  If it were to ask itself what was wrong with what had happened when Deputy Flanagan was Minister for Justice and Equality &ndash; nobody knows, but he might be Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade again at that stage &ndash; and state it worked well, it might ask itself whether it wanted to waste time and money in establishing this quango to operate in the way envisaged.<\/p> <p>The idea of giving the Houses of Parliament a veto over a statutory instrument is not unprecedented.  I will give an example.  Under the planning Acts exempted development is achieved by way of a statutory instrument, but because of its far-reaching nature, positive affirmation by the Houses of the Oireachtas is required to alter what is exempted development.  The Minister is not just being given the right to proceed, subject to the right of the Houses to intervene to cancel an otherwise self-executing power, to make a statutory instrument or regulation.  There are instances where the Houses of the Oireachtas are given not merely the power to veto a regulation made by the Minister but also the right to ensure no regulations can be made unless they are positively in agreement with them.  Even within the four corners of the Bill under discussion, the lay people who are to be appointed to the commission may be appointed only by a vote in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If the Oireachtas was to decide not to appoint them, the commission could never come into being.  Let us be clear: it is the next D&aacute;il and Seanad that will actually decide whether the Bill will come into operation in its current form or will be amended.  Senator Bacik has said she believes in some degree of reform.  While I have no problem with some degree of reform of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board system, I contend that where there is positive will, it works extremely well.  It does not work in as cumbersome a way as this legislation will if it is brought into operation.<\/p> <p>I am not making a threat but a plea to the Minister to enable the Cabinet procedures that he and his Cabinet colleagues, including the Attorney General and the Taoiseach, have used which require the Minister to consult the Attorney General on judicial appointments proposed by him at the Cabinet.  That procedure works well if it is worked by people of good will.  It works much more efficiently than what is proposed.  Let me give an example.  The Minister could not possibly have made some of the appointments made recently if this Bill had been in operation.  He recently appointed members of the High Court to the Court of Appeal and within weeks appointed practising barristers and solicitors to fill the resulting vacancies.  That could not happen under the proposed legislation unless it was to happen under section 51, or it were to be said the appointments would be made, irrespective of the commission.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to reflect on what he has done in the past few weeks.  Since the start of the new law year, he has appointed six members of the Court of Appeal, four of whom were existing judges, while two were drawn from practising professions.  He recently appointed four or five individuals &ndash; four at any rate &ndash; to fill the vacancies created in the High Court as a consequence.  He has made excellent appointments, but that could not have happened under the Bill.  The first thing he would have had to have done was advertise the vacancies in the Court of Appeal that he was proposing to fill.  That would have taken months.  When the Government finally had its short list and to decide in favour or against it which would have resulted in vacancies in the High Court, it would have had to appoint judges to fill them, again using a cumbersome procedure.  What was done in a matter of weeks could take six months under this legislation if it were to take effect.  It is retrograde that it has not been amended to take account of this.<\/p> <p>All I can say is that an amendment of mine that the Minister accepted on Committee Stage to section 51 is the only way out of the mess.  It simply involves disregarding the whole process.  If there were to be a succession of appointments to the superior courts, the commission would simply be told that it was out of it, that its advice was not needed, that we were quite capable of making a proper decision ourselves and that we proposed to do so, in which case, under section 51, the commission would have no other function.  This scenario shows that a wiser Government which was under less pressure would hesitate before commencing the provision and that a wiser D&aacute;il and Seanad would tell the Government not to proceed and instead stick to the current system, which works so well when operated by people of good will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019111900002#EEE00800","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1574173800,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to prolong the debate, but I want to respond briefly, having regard to the vehemence and determination of Senator McDowell in making his argument.
