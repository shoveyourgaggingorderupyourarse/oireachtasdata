Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask that committee members confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.<\/p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.<\/p><p>Today, we will examine the 2019 financial statements of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Areas of interest to members, which An Bord Plean&aacute;la<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>have been made aware of, include strategic housing developments, the judicial review process, the regular objection process and staffing levels at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To assist us in our examination of the 2019 financial statements, we are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la: Mr. Dave Walsh, chairperson, Mr. Gerard Egan, director of corporate affairs and Ms Anne Killian, finance officer.  They are all very welcome. <\/p><p>When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. <\/p><p>Before I start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask the witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.<\/p><p>I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021051300002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620894600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Under the Planning and Development Acts, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is responsible for the determination of appeals of local authority planning decisions, and for the determination of direct planning applications for strategic housing and infrastructure development.

We will endeavour to address all queries as best we can.  With the indulgence of the committee, I may ask my colleagues to come in on some more technical matters as they are more familiar and have the detailed information to hand.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman outlined, it is important to remind the committee that it is not appropriate to discuss individual planning cases, as to do so could compromise decisions and various judicial review cases before the courts.  However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will aim to be as helpful as we can to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The board is well aware of its critical role in the planning system in considering, and determining, appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals.  We remain committed to delivering robust decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  We are also cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities.  I can confirm that the board considers itself in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.<\/p> <p>  We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee and internal audits, as well as undertaking regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risk and mitigation actions.  As is required under the code of practice, I receive a report annually from the independent external chair of the audit and risk committee and the committee's most recent report has confirmed that our risk management processes and internal controls are operating effectively.  As chairperson, I am also reassured of our financial and governance controls through the unqualified audit opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General both for 2019 and for all previously audited years.<\/p> <p>  The committee will have noted from our annual accounts that in financial terms, the board had a total income of over &euro;25 million in 2019, comprised, as Mr. McCarthy has said, of an Exchequer grant of &euro;18.6 million and - there is a correction there - of fee revenue of just under &euro;6.4 million.  This represents an increase from 2018, when we received &euro;17.5 million in Exchequer grants and took in just over &euro;3 million in fee revenue.<\/p> <p>  To give a little background on the organisation, the board currently has 175.3 whole-time equivalent staff and nine board members.  The Minister and the Department have been very supportive in approving recent resource requests in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments and major infrastructure projects.  The board is currently engaging with the Department on an updated workforce plan for 2021-22 to meet its evolving needs and work demands.<\/p> <p>  The board's primary role is to make planning decisions in a timely and efficient manner in accordance with the legislative framework under which we operate and having regard to the overarching planning policy framework as determined by the Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  While I appreciate that we are discussing the 2019 annual report and accounts, I would like to give the committee a more up-to-date picture of our casework levels using 2020 statistics.<\/p> <p>  The year 2020 was very challenging for the board, as it was for many organisations and for society generally, with major disruptions to normal life and work practices due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, despite these disruptions, the board was able to remain open for business throughout the various lockdowns with planning designated as an essential service by the Government.<\/p><p>Moreover, with the co-operation and goodwill of board members, staff and the various active participants in the planning system, including the public, we were able to keep our public office open in a safe manner and were able to maintain a fairly high level of case output.  We adapted our practices to enable some online services and virtual meetings, including the holding of remote oral hearings, and facilitated hybrid office-home working patterns for all staff to ensure that we fully adhered to all health and safety requirements to protect everyone.<\/p><p> While the total number of cases received and decided were down slightly on the 2019 totals, due in part to the eight-week planning timeline extensions in April and May, 76% of all planning appeal cases were decided within the statutory objective period, SOP.  This is a significant achievement, considering the overall challenging operational environment in which the staff and board members were working, and represents a further improvement on the comparable 2019 figure of 69%, and well ahead of the 43% compliance rate recorded back in 2018.<\/p><p> Looking back on 2020, with nine of its months significantly impacted by Covid-19 related restrictions, and many of these effects continuing well into 2021, I am hugely proud of the commitment, resilience and efforts by our entire board and staff in keeping the show on the road through progressing and deciding cases.  The challenge is now to maintain this level of compliance amidst the ongoing disruptions due to Covid restrictions, to further streamline our systems, as well as to adapt to more flexible working patterns and practices.  Thus far this year, case activity in the first three months of 2021 has been fairly busy, with 781 new application and appeal cases lodged and 631 cases disposed, which suggests a similar caseload over the course of this year, as the economy recovers following the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p> In relation to strategic housing developments, SHDs, the board has continued to prioritise these and we decided 126 such applications during 2020, all within the statutory timelines.  Of these cases, 98 decisions were to grant permission, facilitating more than 25,400 residential units, three quarters of which were for apartments, as well as 2,300 student bed spaces and some 570 shared accommodation bed spaces.  It is also important to note that the board refused 28 of the applications decided last year, evidence that the board continues to assess all applications against the principles of proper planning and sustainable development and refuses those that fail these criteria.  The increasing numbers of pre-application consultations would suggest that 2021 will see a further increase in SHD applications between now and when the legislative scheme expires early next year.<\/p><p> Similarly, building on the 24 strategic infrastructure applications received in 2020 and the 19 cases decided, the trend in pre-applications in 2020 and so far this year would indicate more infrastructural projects being lodged with us in the near future.<\/p><p> Amidst all the Covid-related disruptions, the board was able to progress our major IT transformational project, Plean-IT, with the establishment of an in-house development team to drive forward further enhancements and functionality within the system.  While the ultimate aim is to facilitate the online submission of applications and appeals, aligned with the planning authorities&rsquo; e-planning initiative, we were able to advance a number of important developments during 2020 and into 2021, such as the launch last November of our online facility enabling observations on strategic housing development applications and the design of a more user-friendly and informative website designed to make it easier for everyone to find the information that they are looking for and to provide useful guidance on how to lodge or comment on an strategic development application or planning appeals.  The new website was launched last month and the board is pleased with the largely positive feedback in this initial phase.  We expect further phased roll-out of online services this year and into 2022.<\/p><p>I am conscious that I am taking up members&rsquo; valuable time to raise specific issues so I will leave it there.  We have provided some statistics and charts in the appendix to the opening statement and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021051300002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620894600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Deputy Verona Murphy is the first speaker, she has 15 minutes, Deputy Dillon is next with ten minutes and everyone thereafter has five minutes.

Of the 4,334 houses encompassed in the residential unit delivery of 16,600, about 1,200 were semi-detached houses, possibly with a garden.  The rest were terraced housing, just over 3,200.  The densities being applied are resulting in family-unfriendly homes.   As for the section on legal proceedings, I was in business for 30-odd years and when looking at overall costs, one looks at the highest costs to see what can be done about them.  I was pretty overwhelmed when I saw the figure for legal fees of almost &euro;3.5 million.  It is extraordinary.  It accounts for 17% of the contribution from the Exchequer of just over &euro;18 million.  It is the biggest expense after salaries.  I also note that &euro;1.78 million of that was paid out in third-party settlements.  I find that unbelievable.

In many cases, the judicial review process could be seen to be the normal appeal process where an SHD has been granted.  In the context of the overall numbers since the SHD process was commissioned and began in 2017, the board has made around 280 decisions and I think about 54 of those have been judicially reviewed.  About one sixth of the decisions taken, therefore, have been challenged in the courts.

I think that is the case when anything new is brought in.  When strategic infrastructure was introduced in 2007 to allow for large-scale applications directly to the board, there was a significant increase in the number of challenges being taken on wind farms and major industrial developments.

That was considered to be an incredibly serious matter.  The process for that involved councillors meeting in public session and the rationale in terms of the proposition to take a different course than recommended being clearly outlined.  The positions of each councillor would be then minuted and the votes identified in the minutes.  It would be extensively reported in local media.

I go back to when Plean-IT started, which was way back in 2014.  At that stage, it was a proposed cost for five years of just under &euro;3 million, or &euro;2.934 million.  That was broken down into consultancy work for scoping.  In the first year, I understand there were some delays due to the tender process and in order to get the correct people, and then the project was up and running.  In 2014, the spend was quite low and, again, the spend was quite low in 2015.  It was mainly what we would call consumables in that we were assessing what we needed.  We capitalise what we build, so it would be later on in the project that there would be more capital spend.  It moved into 2016, where the spend was &euro;572,000.  In 2017, there was a larger capital build because that is when the Plean-IT system was being fully geared up to go live, and it went live in October 2017.  We then moved on to 2018.  The capital cost dipped at that stage and we moved to rolling it out, getting it functional and getting more functions involved, such as bulk uploads and different bundles the designers had been working on, and the consultants were engaged in assessing what scope we required.  In 2019, there was a spend of &euro;568,346 in total.  Capital is &euro;139,000 or &euro;140,000 of that, and there are consumables.  At that stage, the in-house developers moved in on the process, so there was a bigger consumable spend at that stage.<\/p> <p>  A reassessment was done in October 2020, looking at the spend to date.  With all the different changes that were required as the years passed and the needs changed, we had a six-year spend which was coming out at &euro;3.4 million.

It is very timely in the context of the marine Bill moving through the Oireachtas.  We have obviously adapted our systems and capacity to ensure that we have the right skill set, as well as the numbers to process efficiently any applications or appeals that come to us.  As I indicated, the Department and the Minister have been very supportive in ensuring that we have received approval for the resources, both financial and staffing, in recent years.<\/p> <p>  In our submission we outlined that we have a workforce plan currently before the Department for consideration.  As part of that, we acknowledge and recognise the challenge that the board and the wider public system face in terms of ensuring that any infrastructure projects that are critical to economic recovery and delivery of the national development plan can be expedited and prioritised.  Marine is a brand new function, so what we are proposing as part of our workforce plan is to create a marine and climate unit to deal with renewables and climate in order to have the expertise to draw on, both internally within the organisation and, where we need particular expertise on hydrological issues or fisheries expertise, that we have panels of people on which to draw.

There may have been flaws in it but the system existed.  Individual planning applications that did not belong to the local authority itself were decided by the professional planners.

Anecdotally, is it An Bord Plean&aacute;la's view that on many of these sites where permission is granted for a developer to develop large numbers of houses, bypassing the local authority structure, the developer subsequently sits on the planning permission and now has a more valuable asset in hand and will simply flip that to the highest bidder when the time is right?<\/p> <p>  We know that house prices are accelerating at the moment.

To come back to my earlier points, I will deal with the example of a refusal by the local authority, but it could as easily be an approval.  A type of development might be precluded by the county development plan, a plan whose development would have involved an enormous level of public consultation and a great amount of deliberation at local authority level based on the advice of officials, which may be adopted by members of the local authority.  Let us take the case of a developer making a proposal to the local authority.  This developer will probably engage in preplanning consultation and, after submitting the application, further information may be sought.  Another process may go on for six months in which attempts are made to resolve issues.  At the end of the day, the local authority planners may nonetheless decide that the development is inappropriate for a given location.  An appeal may then be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and then the board's inspector, having visited and looked at all the evidence, may decide to recommend that the local authority's decision be upheld.  There will then be a meeting with three representatives, two of whom - who will remain unnamed - may decide to overturn the recommendation of their own inspector and the local authority's decision, while providing minimal information as to how they came to that decision.  It is quite possible that these representatives will never have set foot in the county, never mind having looked at the site in question.

In 2019, we met more than 800 times as a board tribunal.  There were multiple meetings going on.  It is not practical for the board to go out to every single site.  That is why we have a team of 60 inspectors who give us their views.  We look not only at the inspector's report but at all of the information provided, including the local authority's observations, any commentary from State agencies, submissions from observers and so on.  The Oireachtas has designed a system which allows us to use the collective expertise of the board to determine cases.  We have a range of skills.

I welcome Deputy Boyd Barrett, who is not a member but a welcome participant.<\/p> <p>  Before we formally commence, I wish to convey my condolences to those injured and killed in the attacks on both sides of the conflict in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the region over the past few days.  At our meeting on Tuesday, I called on those with influence in the region to use that influence to stop the violence and indiscriminate attacks.  I repeat that call this morning on the basis that it is my firm belief that the way forward must involve dialogue and engagement by the international community with both sides of the conflict and the application, of course, of international law, being mindful of UN resolutions.<\/p> <p>  We are joined this morning by the ambassador of Israel to Ireland, H. E. Mr. Ophir Kariv, Ms Jackie Goodall and Ms Audrey Griffin of the Ireland Israel Alliance, Ms Natasha Hausdorff of UK Lawyers for Israel, and Mr. Alan Shatter, a former Oireachtas Member, a former member of this committee in a previous D&aacute;il and no stranger to these proceedings.  The witnesses are all very welcome and I thank them for meeting with us this morning.  Today's meeting is the second in a series reviewing the position in the occupied Palestinian territories in respect of displacements and the demolition of public and private buildings.  At our meeting on Tuesday, we heard from the ambassador and head of mission of Palestine and representatives of Sadaka.  A further meeting is scheduled for Tuesday of next week.  The committee has also sought written submissions from several interested parties and bodies.  Following our meetings and consideration of all submissions, it is our intention as a committee to publish a report.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting this morning is that we will hear opening statements from H. E. Mr. Kariv, Ms Goodall, Ms Hausdorff and Mr. Shatter, in that order, before proceeding to a question and answer session involving members and witnesses.  As we are limited to two hours, I ask that witnesses be conscious of the time constraints when initially addressing the committee.  Due to the changing circumstances in the region, I will allow some latitude to discuss the ongoing crisis.  However, I remind guests and members that the main purpose of the meeting is to inform committee members in respect of displacements and the demolition of public and private buildings in order for the committee to report on those matters.  I ask that members and witnesses be conscious of our terms of reference when speaking.  In the first round of questions, each member will have seven minutes for questions and answers.  After six minutes, I will indicate that there is one minute remaining.  Should time permit, we will open up the meeting at the end to deal with other outstanding issues.  However, as stated, the session must conclude within two hours, having regard to the Covid restrictions under which we are operating.<\/p> <p>   I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if any statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I need not remind our guests that it is imperative that any such direction be complied with immediately.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as do witnesses who are physically present in the building.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence given.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex or in the national convention centre, where some parliamentary sittings are taking place during the Covid pandemic.  For anybody watching this meeting online, some members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending remotely, I ask that everybody bear with us in the event of any issue of a technical nature arising.  I thank those responsible for the technical logistics for their work so far.  I hope matters proceed smoothly over the next two hours.<\/p> <p>  It gives me pleasure to call on Ambassador Kariv to make his opening statement to the committee.  He has the floor and he is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#A00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in this discussion.  The subject of today&rsquo;s meeting is an important one.  In addition to discussing the historical, legal and humanitarian aspects of the issue at hand, today&rsquo;s discussion can also be a starting point to explore the ways in which Ireland can constructively contribute to progress in the Middle East peace efforts in general and to Palestinian welfare in particular.<\/p> <p>  The area referred to today as the West Bank was first delineated in 1949 in the armistice agreement signed by Israel and Jordan following the Israeli war of independence.  That war was launched by the Arab world, including the Palestinians, to prevent implementation of the two-state solution, known as the partition plan, proposed by the UN General Assembly in 1947, accepted by the Jewish national leadership and rejected by the Arabs.  In that war, the newly-established state of Israel thwarted the co-ordinated attempt of five Arab armies and Palestinian militias to exterminate the nascent state.  In part due to inspiration by then Palestinian leader, the Nazi collaborator Haj Amin al-Husseini, not a single Jew remained in areas under Arab control in what used to be mandatory Palestine.  At the same time, Arabs living in Israel constitute today 20% of its population and enjoy full and equal civil rights.  After the war, that area was annexed by Jordan in an act recognised by only two states. <\/p> <p>  Israel gained control over the West Bank in 1967 following another war of self-defence forced on it by several Arab armies, including Jordan, which annexed that territory.  Following the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, PLO, the Palestinian National Authority was created and for the first time in their history, Palestinians achieved self-administration.  While Arab citizens of Israel are the only Arabs in the Middle East to enjoy full and equal civil rights in a real democracy, the only time the Palestinian national movement managed to produce any tangible achievements has been through direct negotiations with Israel.  <\/p> <p>  Area C, the geographical area we are discussing today, constitutes approximately 60% of the territory of Judea and Samaria, or the West Bank.  At the same time, it is home to less than 10% of Palestinians living in the West Bank, while over 90% live under full civil administration of the Palestinian National Authority in Areas A and B.  Those areas were agreed on and defined in the signed Oslo Accords.  These accords also specify that Area C remains under full Israeli control, both security and civil.  In the lack of progress in negotiations due to the years long Palestinian refusal to renew them, those agreements continue to serve as the legal and practical framework for everyday life in those areas. <\/p> <p>  The final status of these areas is one of the main issues to be negotiated in the framework of a final peace agreement which is for all our mutual benefit.  Israel has repeatedly shown its readiness to make painful compromises for the sake of genuine peace and we want to achieve a just and lasting peace with our Palestinian neighbours.  In the interim, in accordance with international law and the signed agreements, Israel continues to administer Area C through the military commander of Judea and Samaria.  Under the provisions of international law and the signed agreements, the Israeli authorities are also responsible for civil administration in Area C, including safety, planning and construction.  Therefore, all activities in these spheres have to be co-ordinated with the relevant Israeli authorities.  Israel is committed to carrying out its responsibilities in Area C to maintain law and order according to international law and the existing agreements.  <\/p> <p>  We call on all stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and foreign governments, to conduct their activities in this area in a responsible and lawful manner and to make sure all activities and projects are adequately co-ordinated with the relevant Israeli authorities.  We have the same interest to take care of, develop and promote Palestinian welfare.  <\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to the current situation in our region.  We just saw another night of barrages of indiscriminate rocket fire from the Gaza Strip by the Hamas terrorist organisation.  Our citizens, millions of Israelis, had to spend the night in shelters and safe rooms.  I know this first-hand from my family who live there and spent last night there.  I hope the committee will find room to condemn the terrorist attacks of Hamas with no reservations.  These attacks are unacceptable and I hope the committee believes that as well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#B00100","nonspeaker":"H.E. Mr. Ophir Kariv"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and committee for the invitation to speak this morning.  I will introduce Ms Audrey Griffin, who is a member of the Ireland Israel Alliance, and Mr. Alan Shatter, who is also a member and supporter of the organisation.  Ms Natasha Hausdorff will speak on behalf of UK Lawyers for Israel.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the members of the Ireland Israel Alliance, I offer my deepest condolences to all of those affected by over 1,200 Hamas rockets, and counting, raining down on Israel since Monday, a day when the people of Israel celebrated Jerusalem Day.  My condolences not only extend to Israeli citizens &ndash; Jews, Arabs and other minorities - but to the many Irish citizens with close family and friends in Israel and also members of the Palestinian communities, thousands of whom work in Israel daily ]to provide a better living for their families and the majority of whom want nothing more than to live in peace. <\/p> <p>  The Ireland Israel Alliance was established in 2018 because a growing number of Irish citizens were becoming increasingly concerned that the narrative circulating in the Irish public arena regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was disproportionately focused against Israel.  Our objective is to bring more balance to that narrative and to make a constructive contribution to the debate.  We support a two-state solution and we encourage and support peaceful coexistence between Arabs, Jews and other minorities living within Israel and in the Palestinian territories. <\/p> <p>  Sadly, however, we continue to witness from certain sectors of society in Ireland a wholly biased anti-Israel narrative.  It is to be variously found on our streets and television screens, in our national press and especially on social media, resulting in giving those who wish to see Israel destroyed the oxygen to breed discord and hate.  When Mark Twain visited the Holy Land in 1867, he wrote that it was &ldquo;a ... [desolate] heart-broken land.&rdquo;  Travelling on horseback through the Jezreel Valley he noted there was \"not a solitary village throughout its whole extent&rdquo; and that a person could travel for &ldquo;ten miles ... and not see ten human beings&rdquo;. <\/p> <p>  That said, there has been a continuous Jewish presence in Israel for 3,000 years, backed up by extensive and ongoing archaeological evidence.  The Jewish people have a deep connection and love for the land from which they were twice exiled.  Now back in their ancient homeland, they have always been, and continue to be, willing to share it.  However, every single offer of peace so far has been rejected by the Palestinian leadership.  <\/p> <p>  We firmly believe that the existence of Jewish communities within Palestinian areas is not an obstacle to peace, but an opportunity for coexistence and reconciliation.  A prime example is Gaza.  I visited Israel in 2005 when I witnessed approximately 8,000 Jewish people forcefully removed under the direction of Israel&rsquo;s then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, in a well-meaning but failed attempt at land for peace.  Today, not one single Jewish person lives in Gaza, never mind a Jewish community.  <\/p> <p>  Shortly after Israel&rsquo;s disengagement from Gaza and its takeover by the internationally recognised terrorist group Hamas, their militants started killing their Palestinian rivals by throwing them off 15-storey buildings and mutilating their bodies in the most barbaric ways.<\/p><p>In addition, greenhouses and irrigation systems left by the departing Gaza Jewish communities were smashed and destroyed.<\/p><p> Do not get me wrong.  We are not anti-Palestinian; quite the contrary.  Sadly, many of Israel&rsquo;s enemies are both anti-Israel and anti-Palestinian, because they are more interested in persistent efforts to demonise, delegitimise and socially isolate the sovereign and democratic state of Israel than in trying to improve the lives of the Palestinian people and encourage Palestinian economic development within Palestinian areas.<\/p><p> The Ireland Israel Alliance took a delegation to visit Jewish towns and developments and joint Jewish-Israeli-Palestinian industrial estates in the West Bank and Jordan Valley in 2019.  There we witnessed Palestinian and Jewish communities working and studying together and enjoying peaceful and harmonious coexistence.  Interestingly, we discovered in a business we visited in the Barkan industrial estate that the manager in charge was a local Palestinian who managed a workforce of both Israelis and Palestinians.  The truth is that these communities desperately want peace, an end to the conflict and economic stability.<\/p><p> One of the Jewish families we visited in the Jordan Valley told us they regularly visit Palestinian villages, have Palestinian friends and often attend each other&rsquo;s family celebrations, including weddings and bar mitzvahs.  However, many of these hardworking and peaceful Palestinians are afraid to publicly admit this because of intimidation and harassment from the Palestinian Authority.  Palestinian leaders do not need to care about the welfare of Palestinians, because they will use any opportunity to avoid having elections.  Palestinian leaders benefit from the dependency of Palestinians on massive external aid which provides opportunities for the diversion of funds to their own pockets, not to mention their notorious &ldquo;pay for slay&rdquo; policy that incentivises and rewards the murder of Jewish Israelis.  Incitement to violence has long been a favoured tactic of the Palestinian leadership, as we are currently witnessing.  When demands for violence using the code \"peaceful popular resistance\" in the name of protecting Jerusalem are broadcast by Palestinian media, the Palestinian public understands exactly what is required of them.<\/p><p> The Jordan Valley is a vast area and represents the best of Israeli ingenuity.  Apart from the Palestinian city of Jericho, the remaining 200,000 acres of desert land were largely vacant until Israelis started developing the region in 1968.  Despite the challenges of lack of sufficient water resources and intense heat, it produces a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and is known as a world leader in the Medjoul date market, with 6,200 acres farmed by Israelis and 3,000 acres farmed by Palestinians.  In the Barkan industrial zone in the northern West Bank alone, there are some 164 factories employing about 7,200 workers, of whom about 4,000 are Palestinians, many of them in management positions.  The employment of Palestinians in Israeli businesses in the West Bank promotes peace and reconciliation through the good relations created between Israelis and Palestinians working together.<\/p><p> In 2018, the Ireland Israel Alliance submitted a report to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence regarding the Occupied Territories Bill, legislation which seeks to boycott Israeli settlements in the West Bank and parts of Jerusalem.  Proponents of the Bill seem to believe that this will promote the prospect of peace in the Middle East and benefit Palestinians.  In our view, it would have exactly the opposite effect.  Not only that, but a draconian and discriminatory Bill that threatens Irish citizens who trade with Israeli businesses in the West Bank and parts of Jerusalem with fines of up to &euro;250,000 and a five-year prison term is hardly the way to encourage good relationships between Israeli people and Irish people.  It serves only to cause more suspicion and division.<\/p><p> In the context of the barrage of over 1,200 rockets fired indiscriminately into Israeli civilian territory and the multiple Israeli casualties since Monday, I will finish with a personal story of a visit our delegation took to the Ziv Medical Center in the north of Israel, 11 km from the border with Lebanon and 30 km from Syria.  The staff are multi-ethnic, reflecting the wonderful mosaic of people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds, including Muslims, Christians, Jews, Bedouin and Druze.  This gives the lie to the absurd claim that Israel is an apartheid state.  We met the hospital&rsquo;s general director, Dr. Salman Zarka, himself a Druze, who spoke to us about the unique security challenges the hospital faces.<\/p><p> During the Second Lebanon War of 2006, the hospital took direct hits from Hezbollah missiles while staff continued to treat 1,500 wounded Syrians, sometimes under fire.  At the height of the Syrian civil war, the hospital provided unique humanitarian aid to some 5,000 Syrians, many of them unaccompanied children.  By 2013, the battle in Syria spread to Israel&rsquo;s border and the wounded started to arrive.  Under international law, it is acceptable to close your border in times of war.  However, Israel is known for providing humanitarian aid to people all over the world.  The hospital decided to provide medical help to wounded Syrians and set up a field hospital at the border with an intensive care unit.  Later, it evacuated them to the Ziv hospital before sending them back to Syria.<\/p><p> Before we left, Dr. Zarka told us that they are praying and hoping for peace but that they have to be ready for war.  Dr. Zarka&rsquo;s comments resonate with everyone I spoke to during our time in Israel, and also with those Israelis, both Jewish and Arab, that I communicate with on a daily basis.  The people of Israel, and many Palestinians, are crying out for peace, literally.<\/p><p> I therefore ask members of this committee to ensure that any decisions they make of relevance to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or which could detrimentally impact upon Israel do not exclude Ireland from playing a practical role in reigniting a viable peace process and that decisions made by the committee are ones that encourage and promote peace and not division, remembering that truth does not always belong to those who shout loudest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jackie Goodall","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I appear before the committee not as a representative of the state of Israel but as a legal practitioner and the legal director of UK Lawyers for Israel, UKLFI, charitable trust.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to address the slew of falsehoods delivered to this committee two days ago.  It is with great concern that I address, first and most important, how Irish aid is being hoodwinked to devote funds to a political campaign and funnelled into illegal building projects which fuel the conflict and perpetuate Palestinian suffering.  Second, I will address the underlying legal status of the disputed territory.  Third, I propose to explain the specific instance of the recent property dispute in Sheikh Jarrah and the context in which illegal squatters face eviction.<\/p> <p>  This hearing takes place in shocking circumstances, in the context of a campaign of terror waged by Palestinian terrorist groups as part of an internal Palestinian power struggle and with the aim of Israel's destruction.<\/p><p>What all the presentations on Tuesday left out is Palestinian terrorism, which has been the hallmark of the last few days and has blighted Israel's 73 years of existence.  It has been incited and encouraged by the same fabrications that were aired in this committee two days ago.  To describe Israel as colonialist is an outrage.  Jews, who had been persecuted around the world, found shelter among their brothers in their homeland and paid dearly in blood to survive years of onslaught by invading Arab armies, many having themselves been ethnically cleansed from those same Arab countries, are now being called colonialist for the crime of their continued existence.  <br\/><br\/>It cannot be overstressed that Irish aid funding for illegal building projects in Area C does a great deal of harm.  The Palestinian Authority has full planning control over Areas A and B, where more than 70% of the land is suitable for development and empty.  There are indeed opportunities for development, such as the impressive building projects in Rawabi, the first planned Palestinian town, which I have had the privilege of visiting many times.  Aid could be going to planned initiatives which would help ordinary local people.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to the building projects at Khirbet Humsah, firing range 203 in the Jordan Valley, also called Humsa Al Bqai'a, and the firing range 917 in the Hebron hills, these are not Palestinian communities.  These areas have always been state land since the time of the Ottomans and were designated by the IDF as training grounds because of uninhabitable conditions.  No peace-promoting purpose is served by building illegally in the middle of a firing range, removed from basic municipal services such as water, electricity, sewerage systems and links to other communities.  It is illegal outposts built without planning permission or permits that are subject to removal and demolition, just as they would be if I or members of the committee sought to build on the Curragh in County Kildare or the Salisbury Plain firing range in England without planning permission and a permit. <br\/><br\/>It is important that we are clear about the underlying legal status of the territory through the proper application of universal principles of international law.  There is a fundamental principle of customary international law which establishes the borders of newly emerging states at independence, as in Israel's case in 1948.  It is universally applied.  In the 19th century the principle was applied in South America, later it was applied in Asia and Africa and, still later, at the disintegration of the former communist federations.  It has been applied to all the states that emerged in all these cases, as well as to states emerging from former mandates.  The universal rule for determining the borders of newly emerging states at the moment of independence dictates that the new state takes on the boundaries of the pre-existing administrative unit as its interactional borders.  The principle is called <i>uti possidetis juris<\/i>.  It is the default rule to provide certainty, avoid frontiers being challenged, avoid wars breaking out and promote peace and stability.  Those are the reasons the International Court of Justice, ICJ, recognised as being behind the development of this fundamental principle.<br\/><br\/>Another fundamental principle of international law is equal application.  One cannot have a general rule and an exception for a country that one just does not like very much or to which one has some ideological and-or political opposition.  That is not how any responsible legal system can operate.  The question then is what does this principle, universally applied, tell us about the legal status of the territory in Israel's case.  In 1948, the administrative lines of the eastern side of the British Mandate for Palestine ran along the Jordan river all the way to the south, originally dividing it from the separate administrative unit of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.  By the way, Jordan's borders also follow the principle of <i>uti possidetis juris<\/i>.  Israel, as the only state to emerge from the British Mandate for Palestine territory in 1948, automatically assumed as its borders the administrative lines of the former mandate territory, and that included eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank which were areas occupied by Jordan in 1948 during Israel's war of independence.  These same areas were recovered by Israel in 1967.  <br\/><br\/>The legal status of that territory applying this principle is that Israel has been the sovereign since 1948 and Israel's borders were those of the British Mandate for Palestine territory which preceded it, except where otherwise agreed upon by Israel and its relevant neighbour.  Indeed, Israel's peace treaties with its neighbouring states to date, namely, Egypt and Jordan, reinforce that reading because the treaties ratify borders between Israel and its neighbours explicitly based on the boundaries of the British Mandate for Palestine.  There has been no agreement of any kind on the transfer of sovereignty since 1948.  In the 1990s, Israel entered into agreements with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation to divide up administrative control.  Areas A and B were to be under the territorial control of the PLO and Area C remained under Israeli territorial control.  All the agreements have been explicit about not addressing issues of national sovereignty.  That has been left open for future final status agreements.  Therefore, we are left with the original general doctrine regarding the new state incorporating the territory of the previous administrative unit.  <br\/><br\/>I noted several references on Tuesday to the case of Crimea.  Ukraine still has sovereignty over Crimea, despite Russia's invasion, and that goes back to the principle of <i>uti possidetis juris<\/i>and the administrative boundaries of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  When it became independent, it did so in the entire administrative unit of the former Soviet republic.  If Ukraine were to one day recover Crimea from Russia, as Israel did with eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan in 1967, no one here would accuse Ukraine of being in occupation of Crimea.  <br\/><br\/>Much has been made, for political purposes in recent days, of the property dispute in Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.  Israel's critics have distorted the facts, perverted international law and attempted to intimidate the courts and law enforcement officials into adopting a bigoted approach, demanding that the state defy court orders and deny the property owners their legal rights on the basis of the race of the relevant parties.  The current dispute in Sheikh Jarrah involves several properties of tenants whose leases have expired and, in a few cases, squatters with no tenancy rights against owner landlords who have successfully won court orders evicting the squatters and overstaying tenants.  <br\/><br\/>Litigation of these properties has been an ongoing subject for decades and the case has gone all the way to the Supreme Court.  The owners in these disputes acquired their rights through an uninterrupted chain of transactions from predecessors in title in the 19th century.  These legal rights were acquired under Ottoman law and have remained good through all subsequent government regimes, namely, the British Mandate for Palestine, Jordanian occupation and purported annexation, and Israeli.  No one seriously disputes the validity of the transactions through which the current owners acquired rights from their predecessors in title.  The tenants in these disputes acquired their leasehold rights through a chain running from the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property in the 1950s.  Their rights as leaseholders, not owners, were reaffirmed in several court rulings that culminated in 1982 with Israel's civil courts issuing rulings adopting settlement agreements between the leaseholders' predecessors in title and the owners.<br\/><br\/>The only break in the owners' uninterrupted chain of title is the seizure of these properties from 1948 to 1967 by the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property.  This is when Jordan, which had illegally occupied eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank during its invasion of Israel in 1948, ethnically cleansed these areas of all Jews.  Jordan transferred custody over all Jewish-owned property to the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property.  However, it never transferred title to any party and it never extinguished the owners' rights.  Instead, the custodian leased some of the properties to Arabs, who were the predecessors to the current overstaying tenants.  <br\/><br\/>When Israel regained the territory in 1967 and Jordan's occupation of eastern Jerusalem ended, Israel adopted legislation which vindicated the private property rights of persons of all ethnicities.<\/p><p>The Legal and Administrative Matters Law 1970 preserved the rights of private parties who received title from the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property.  Notwithstanding the illegality of Jordan's occupation, those who received rights from the Jordanian custodian were all Arabs, since Jordanian law denied property rights to Jews.  Ironically, if the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property had assigned title to the predecessors of the current Arab holdover tenants over the lands it seized from Jewish owners, Israeli law would have respected the resulting title.<\/p><p> The reason the holdover tenants in Sheikh Jarrah lack ownership today is not because the State of Israel has denied Palestinians any rights they acquired but, rather, because the Government of Jordan declined to give Palestinian Arabs title to the land Jordan had seized.  Israel has not granted anyone ownership of any of the affected properties and Israeli law respects and upholds the property rights of persons of all ethnicities.  Israel has even respected the property rights created by prior regimes that explicitly discriminated against Jews in their property law, namely, the Ottoman Empire, the British Mandate of Palestine and the Jordanian occupation regime.  That is the reality.  The claim of illegality is fabricated.  I welcome questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Natasha Hausdorff","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hausdorff.

Having been a founder member of this committee and having sat in many such meetings, it is a little surreal to be making a submission to it.  I would like to explain my capacity in making that submission.  I was a founding member of the Oireachtas Ireland-Israel parliamentary friendship group, as Ms Goodall mentioned.  I am a member and supporter of the Ireland Israel Alliance.  I am also chairperson of Magen David Adom Ireland, which is a support group for the Israeli ambulance and emergency services and a member of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  It is one of the most integrated organisations in Israel, with 22,000 members across all communities, Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Druze.  It provides emergency healthcare and assistance across the whole span of Israeli society and is currently on the front line in providing medical help and assistance in the context of the current conflict.<br\/><br\/>I am involved in the Ireland Israel Alliance because I believe there is a need to further deepen good relationships between Ireland and Israel.  I believe Ireland, from its own perspective, has a unique contribution it could make to reigniting what is a moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  Sadly, to date, not only does Ireland not make that contribution but, in stances on occasion taken, it places itself in a position where it lacks credibility to engage in a constructive manner in the peace process.  I have for many years been an advocate and supporter of a two-state solution.  I have met with many of the Israeli political leaders and many of the Palestinian leaders, including President Abbas on a number of occasions and the late Saeb Erekat, who was one of the principal negotiators.  Tragically, the successful agreed implementation of a two-state solution remains a distant dream and we now find ourselves with yet another tragically unnecessary conflict, with lives being unnecessarily lost and further division created.<br\/><br\/>I followed Tuesday's meeting of this committee with great interest.  I noted that, understandably in the current unfortunate circumstances, it went beyond the original subject matter of the meeting, as the Chairman mentioned.  I am going to touch on a couple of aspects of that.  I also have to say that I found the meeting particularly depressing as an observer because no hard questions were asked in response to presentations made.  No matter what side they are on, and I do not believe members of the foreign affairs committee should be on any side other than Ireland's side, it behoves members to ask the hard questions and tease out propositions that are presented before it.  No mention was made of UN Resolution 181, which envisaged in 1947 the creation of both a Jewish and an Arab state.  It also envisaged something that seems to have been forgotten, namely, Jewish and Arab minorities peacefully living in each state.  It never envisaged the Jewish people living in an Arab state and being pejoratively labelled as settlers or that the Arab state to emerge from the 1947 resolution would be <i>judenfrei<\/i>, that is, free of all Jews and with no Jews permitted to reside in it.  Of course, that resolution referred to a Jewish state and an Arab state and made no reference at the time to what we all now perceive to be, and hope some time in the future will be, a Palestinian state.<br\/><br\/>No mention was made at the committee meeting of Resolution 181 or its importance as a bedrock resolution to where we are today.  No mention was made of the divisions between Fatah and Hamas and that, for 14 years, Gaza and the West Bank have been ruled by two entirely separate political entities, often in violent confrontation with each other.  No mention was made that Hamas remains committed to Israel's total destruction, an objective supported by Iran.  There was no mention that President Abbas and members of the Palestinian Authority regularly and ludicrously claim the Jewish people have no historical connection to Jerusalem, to today's Israel and to parts of the Palestinian-administered territory.  There was no questioning of the contention that no Jewish person should reside in the West Bank, or what is known to many Jewish people as Judea and Samaria.  There is something vaguely ludicrous about wrongly accusing Israel of being an apartheid state while advocating that there should be no Jewish community located on any part of what might in the future be Palestinian territory or in any part of what is currently referenced internationally as either the West Bank or Judea and Samaria.<br\/><br\/>There was no questioning of Iran's role in fomenting division and in regard to the current conflict.  There was no mention of the shooting of three 19-year-old Israeli students, one of whom has since died, at a bus stop.  That happened ten days ago, before the current rocket firing commenced.  There was no mention of Hamas celebrating that event.  There was no mention of a Palestinian education system, partially paid for by Irish taxpayers, that brainwashes young children to hate, celebrates atrocities and encourages martyrdom.  That system is creating generations who will oppose any reasonable peace resolution that may at some time in the future emerge.  The manner in which schoolchildren have been taught is creating a series of inflexible generations who will never engage in any support for a compromise solution.  There was no mention of the Palestinian Authority's pay for slay programme, a very basic issue on which I would have thought the Palestinian ambassador would be questioned.<br\/><br\/>There was no mention of paid Hamas operatives regularly rioting at the Gaza border with Israel.  There was no mention of the projectiles regularly fired from Gaza into Israel, putting lives at risk and causing fires and major environmental damage to forests originally planted on barren land.  No mention was made of the intensifying of the firing of such projectiles on Wednesday of last week as a preliminary to the Hamas rockets that are currently hitting Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Shatter"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to intervene but I must do so on the basis of the time constraint under which we are operating.

I find the entire situation going on within Gaza at this point, where we have seen up to 69 people butchered, deeply depressing.  I also find it depressing that not one of our speakers this morning could express any sympathy or remorse for any loss of life, either in Israel or in the Palestinian Territories.  I find that deeply, deeply depressing.  I offer my sympathies to the families of everyone who has lost their life.<\/p> <p>  The blockade of Gaza and the indiscriminate bombing are a collective punishment.  We have seen residential buildings being targeted by Israel; we have seen police stations, a university, power lines, post offices and media towers being hit.  The charge that has been made is that this is all an act of self-defence.  How is butchering 69 people in indiscriminate bombings within Gaza self-defence?  Of course,17 children were killed.  I am holding a photograph of two of them here, Maryam and Zayed.  Together with their mother Rima, who was pregnant, they were butchered in Gaza as part of Israel's self-defence.  How can the witnesses justify that?  They should have a good look at those children.  A total of 17 children were killed.  Are these Hamas terrorists?  The witnesses might answer that question.  How does Israel reconcile its actions within Gaza under international law?  Under the Geneva Convention what Israel is perpetrating is a war crime.<\/p> <p>  I fundamentally believe all people have equal rights and the annexation that is ongoing in East Jerusalem, the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan and constant settlement expansion, are the root causes of what is happening at this point in time.  Do the witnesses blame Israel's own actions, in terms of the settlement expansions, the land-taking, the home demolitions, the evictions and the removal of Palestinians from areas Israel covets as the actual cause of the current crisis? <\/p> <p>  I have studied the maps of Palestine.  I am sure everyone has looked at the map of 1967.  It shows a continuous West Bank.  What is left now after the illegal settlements and the annexation is a series of bantustans which look like South African ones, and we are familiar with the apartheid system that was in place in there.  Is the apartheid system from South Africa the model Israel is using as a blueprint at this point?  Since 1967 there have been more than 250 illegal Israelis settlements established throughout the West Bank and East Jerusalem, inhabited by more than 650,000 settlers, with more than 250,000 occupying settlements in East Jerusalem.  It is very clear from these illegal settlements, the application of laws and the pillaging of Palestinian resources that Israel has annexed massive parts of the West Bank.  Does Israel intend on staying within the lands it occupies and has annexed since 1967?  Its political leaders have stated they will never, ever leave those lands.  Do our guests see a two-state solution as viable?  If they do, I ask that they define what that solution would look like and what borders it wouldcontain.  Why is it apparently legal for Jews to come and claim property in Israel while Palestinians do not have the same rights to claim homes and villages lost in 1948, and subsequently?<\/p> <p>  The Knesset is voting to legalise settlement outposts in the West Bank and to re-establish four settlements which Israel previously removed.  How is that not annexation and how is it not a provocation and a cause of the conflict playing out at the moment?  Having mentioned the Knesset, I raise the enactment of the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, which came in on 19 July 2018.  It sets forth the constitutional order of Israel and articulates the ethnic-religious identity of the state as exclusively Jewish.  It alters the constitutional framework of the state, making changes that violate established international norms and bears distinct characteristics of apartheid.  There is no democratic constitution in the world, that I can see, that designates the constitutional identity of the state on racial grounds, as serving one ethnic group on this basis, namely, this discriminatory law.<\/p><p>How does the ambassador believe that all citizens of Israel can enjoy equal rights?<\/p><p> I refer to the International Criminal Court, which is carrying out an investigation of war crimes perpetrated by Israel.  Will Israel co-operate with that investigation?  Pretending that the court does not have jurisdiction is not going to be much of an argument.  Ireland strongly believes that the International Criminal Court is the body that should adjudicate on all matters such as what is being, and has been, done by Israel.  It is imperative that the court has complete freedom to conduct its investigation.<\/p><p> I wish to raise a few other points.

Our sympathy goes to everybody who is bereaved.  However, to get to the real issue, would our guests, led by the ambassador, accept the contention that there is a particular onus on Israel as the most powerful in the situation to move for peace immediately, as has been requested by President Biden and across the world?  In that context, would they accept that the moral responsibility to move for peace is added to by what happened at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the police involvement there, the recent spate of demolitions and the takeover of properties?<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of the time and the Chairman can interrupt me if I go over, but I wish to briefly go through some figures.  In 2020, demolitions increased to 535, with 169 in Area C.  The home demolitions and displacements in 2020 brought about the movement of 941 persons - 462 women, 442 children, 267 students and 124 refugees.  Under accelerated settlements expansion, the construction of 3,512 settlement units was tendered.  Israel appropriated 20 dunams, or 5,000 acres, of the Palestinian occupied lands.  I will refer to 2021 before leaving the figures.  The 2021 monthly number of structures demolished or seized averaged 117 compared with 71 in previous years, with 305 individuals affected and 172 minors.  Of course, there are the outstanding cases that came into focus recently.<\/p> <p>  My first question is about Israel taking the initiative on peace.  I put in that context the fact that there is an outbreak of civil disobedience and trouble, which is so tragic, between Arab and Israeli people in Israel itself.  Would all logic not suggest that the best option for Israel is Irish policy?  There is no threat to the Israeli state in Irish policy.  Irish policy is a two-state solution.  Would the witnesses not accept that the best position for Israel is to achieve a Palestinian state and a two-state solution, from an Israeli point of view of pure self-interest?<\/p> <p>  Would the witnesses accept - this a real concern and our primary focus today is demolitions - that the demolitions, their nature and the way they are being carried out are putting the two-state solution at risk?  If there are demolitions and settlements in villages and areas, that would make it impossible to get a unified, coherent two-state solution with a separate Palestinian state.  There is a problem there.  Would they accept the contention that is made that this is almost a policy?  If it is not a policy, would they accept that under international law and moral law the settlements and demolitions should stop?<\/p> <p>  The obvious situation we require here is peace.  We can only do so much.  We are active at the UN Security Council.  I believe the witnesses would accept that the statements from Ireland have been very balanced all the time, in the sense that all we have asked for, even no later than last evening by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is the implementation and maintenance of international law and the maintenance of UN resolutions and recommendations.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of justice, structures and so forth in the Palestinian territories.  Something was mentioned the other day and it is fair to put it to the witnesses.  They would probably argue that we should have put more to the other side, and that is their view, but the entire infrastructure being built is prejudicial not only to a two-state solution but even to the proper coexistence of people at present, with distinct roadways and a general distinct segregation system for people.<\/p> <p>  In summary, this country speaks from a perspective of peace and goodwill.  First, do the witnesses think that Israel must move on peace, do the big thing there and almost unilaterally create peace?  Second, do they accept that the demolitions and settlements should stop and that they are ultimately a threat to a two-state solution?  Third, do they accept that there should not be a set of laws or infrastructure in the occupied territories that are likely to result in the alienation and segregation of people and prejudice a two-state solution?  I appreciate the witnesses' presence and their willingness to confront the issues publicly, given the dreadful backdrop we have which is something that traumatises any reasonable person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#G00500","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I will call on the panel now, commencing with the ambassador to whom direct questions were put.

The Chairman can draw it to my attention if I do.<\/p> <p>  Senator Wilson raised the Irish contribution to the process in general and to ending the current conflict in Gaza.  Yes, we believe Ireland can make a positive and constructive contribution to the peace efforts.<\/p><p>This can be done on several levels.  On the ground, we believe we can co-operate with Ireland in projects contributing to the welfare of Palestinians and capacity building of Palestinians.  We have been doing that to an extent.  There is at least one such project in Gaza, co-ordinated with the Israeli authorities, which Ireland and, I believe, France, are carrying out together.  This is an important point because projects which are being co-ordinated with Israel will find an open door on our side.<\/p><p> Another level on which I believe Ireland can help is contributing to both sides from its own experience in solving such complex conflicts.  I remind everyone that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict goes back many years and has many dimensions, including national, geographical, historical and sometimes even religious aspects.  We hope it does not turn into a religious conflict.  Ireland and Irish people know all too well the meaning of such complex and sensitive conflicts.  It is true that these are different stories and the conflicts are not identical but the main points of knowing how to listen to both sides and taking into account the interests, feelings and sensitivities of both sides are essential.<\/p><p> I would be very careful in drawing parallels between the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Irish history and the conflict on the island of Ireland.

It is very easy to look at them this way but that misses the point entirely.  In Ireland, perhaps more than in any other European country, this type of approach should be appreciated.  <\/p><p> Another level on which I believe Ireland can help in contributing to both sides derives from its own experience in solving such complex conflicts.  I remind everyone here again that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one that goes back many years and has many dimensions, whether does are national, geographical, historical and sometimes even religious, although we do hope it does not turn into a religious conflict.

Again, especially in Ireland, perhaps more than in any other European country, this approach should be appreciated.  <\/p><p> If we speak about Irish contributions, these would be practical contributions on the ground in co-ordination with Israel and, in the broader dimension and perspective, the approach of assisting in finding ways to perhaps eventually find a way to achieve reconciliation and a political settlement which meet the needs of Israelis and Palestinians.<\/p><p> When it comes to ending what is happening now in Gaza and Israel, we need a clear stand.  The fact is that Hamas started the barrages of rockets into Israel, and not just Israel, but specifically population centres and civilians and continues to do so.  The international community, including Ireland, should speak with a clear voice that puts things in their place.  Hamas is a terrorist organisation, and is designated as such in Europe.  It has hijacked the people of Gaza.  My heart goes out to the average Gazan.  Do not get me wrong.  I want to clarify this point.  My heart goes out to the people of Gaza who are practically being held hostage there by Hamas.  By the way, when it comes to casualties, we should remember that some 30% of Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets are falling in Gaza itself since this round of conflict started.  That has caused many casualties, including children.  The international community should be very clear on this issue when it comes to dealing with this terrorist organisation.  I am sorry, but when it comes to Hamas there is no other way to look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#G00700","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Many issues were already addressed in my opening remarks, so I will restrict myself to the new material.  The current situation is not a spontaneous escalation.  This has been planned.  Hamas has been stockpiling weapons and rebuilding its terror network with Iranian backing since the last conflict in 2014.  This is why we see more sophisticated weaponry, including Iranian Fajr-5 rockets and heavy mortars, and tactics being developed to attempt to overwhelm Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system which protects the civilian population from bombardment.  It is important to stress to the members of the committee the indiscriminate nature of Hamas missile attacks.  An estimated one third of these missiles have been falling short in Gaza killing Palestinian civilians.  Yes, Hamas is killing its own people and, devastatingly, this is nothing new.  It is also blaming Israel for these killings, which is also nothing new.<\/p> <p>  The committee does not have to take my word for that.  It can take it from the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, which is based in the Gaza Strip, which reported the deaths of those children and the al-Masri family before Israel's response in Gaza began.  That is not to mention the Hamas missile which fell short destroying electricity infrastructure and leaving 100,000 people without electricity and cutting off a hospital.  We must be absolutely clear about the origins of this latest round of violence.  It arises from a power struggle between the Palestinian terrorist groups of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah.  An internal conflict within Hamas between Mohammad Deif and Yahya Sinwar has been brewing.  Tensions were sparked by Mahmoud Abbas's decision to cancel the Palestinian elections because he believed he was going to lose.  He is currently in his 16th year of his final four-year term.   <\/p> <p>  The month of Ramadan is usually tense due to extreme incitement by Arab leaders.  Over the course of this month, the conflict began with random attacks on Jews in Jerusalem by gangs of Arabs.  That quickly escalated, as it was encouraged over social media, to violent riots, first on the Temple Mount and then across Israel.  More recently, elements of the Israeli-Arab population have started to set fire to cities where Arabs and Jews live together.  A minority of Arabs in Haifa, Acre, Ramle and Lod are now promoting rogue elements in the Jewish population there to respond.  This has been resoundingly condemned by the Israeli leadership, which has been calling for restraint.  Social media has played a significant role in Hamas incitement of the Arab population, encouraging Arabs to buy knives for the equivalent of &euro;1.25 to cut the throats of any Jews they can find.  <\/p> <p>  Senior Hamas leader, Fathi Hammad, declared on 7 May that he wanted the people of Jerusalem to cut off the heads of Jews with knives.  In the days leading up to the riots on the Temple Mount compound, Palestinians stockpiled stone slabs, rocks and fireworks around the site.  Thousands of worshippers leaving Friday prayers hurled rocks at Israeli police officers guarding the site, who responded to contain the violence.  These rioters were hurling rocks onto the Western Wall plaza and on to Jewish worshippers who had to be evacuated.  These rioters claimed they were Hamas and shouted that Tel Aviv should be bombed.

The assumption of an occupation or that the presence of Israeli Jews living in the West Bank is in some way an offence to international law is nonsensical.<\/p> <p>  To address Deputy Brady's questions on international law with respect to Israel's recent conduct, it is clear that the IDF adhere to standards well beyond those required by international law.  The measures taken by the Israeli army to prevent civilian casualties are well known and they have been practised through the recent conflicts with the Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip.  They include devoting time to calling individual householders, informing them of strikes that are planned.  They include sending messages via text and also dropping leaflets.  There is also the now renowned knock-on-roof tactic.  That is why, when one looks at the videos coming out of the Gaza Strip over the last few days, one does not see civilians running from strikes because they have already been given the warning.  It is Hamas rockets that fall indiscriminately upon the Palestinian civilians who have no shelters because the Palestinian terrorists put their bombs in shelters and their civilians on top of their bombs of them.  That is the inversion that was already aired earlier today.<\/p> <p>  So far as the breaches of international law that were alleged with respect to Israel's conduct in terms of passing its nation's state law, the fact that this is being challenged is, in my submission, a perfect indication of why nation state law is so important as a constitutional affirmation of Israel's status as a sovereign Jewish nation state.  The eagerness of so many to denounce as undemocratic a measure that is considered mundane elsewhere is instructive.  This was a crucial part of Israel's constitutional process and reflected the key components of the declaration of independence.<\/p> <p>  With respect to settlements, I must question the logic of many of the questions that were posed over Jews living in communities in Judea and Samaria.  If settlements were important to the Palestinians, they would have brought their leadership to the negotiation table sooner rather than later.  As for the West Bank, anyone can drive from the southern to the northern end of the Jordan Valley without encountering a checkpoint.  Route 90 is accessible to everyone.  Therefore, claims that this committee has heard, that a family from Jericho cannot go and float in the Dead Sea, are just false.  There is no impediment to accessing the northern part of the Dead Sea.  In fact, the fact that this committee has been lied to is something that I suggest ought to be taken very seriously indeed.<\/p> <p>  When one looks at the report by Human Rights Watch that has been referenced, which I have read, the report itself-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Natasha Hausdorff"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Hausdorff, as a witness to our committee proceedings and a guest, to desist from using such language and saying that people were lied to at this committee.

For the record, I would like to ensure that it is known that in my opening statement, I offered sincere condolences not only to all Israeli citizens, Jews and Arabs alike, but also to all of the Palestinian communities that are affected, many of whom come into Israel on a daily basis to work to provide for a better living for their families, and also, just as the ambassador did, to the people in Gaza.  There are many innocent Palestinians in Gaza who do not wish to see this war.  They also want peace but they are under the control of a radical Islamist terrorist regime.  It is very important that people actually understand that and the fact that its official policy is to establish an Islamist state from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.  We often hear the phrase, \"From the river to the sea.\"  What does that actually mean?  It means the establishment of an Islamist state from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to refer to Deputy Brady's comment about the deaths that have occurred.  I believe he used the phrase, \"the butchering of children in Gaza\". I remind the Deputy that Hamas fires indiscriminately from heavily populated areas in Gaza - underneath hospitals, in mosques and in private houses.  They are firing those rockets from heavily populated areas in Gaza, indiscriminately, into heavily populated areas in Israel.  That is a double war crime.  I have been researching this whole area for many years and I know it to be fact that Israel does everything in its power not to cause any civilian casualties.  All of the rockets that are fired from Israel result in very direct hits, targeting military rocket launchers and terrorists.  It does not fire at civilians.  I would like that to be put on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Jackie Goodall"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I will go back to members of the committee.

My questions are shadowed by the statement of the Israeli defence minister that Israel will not stop its military operation in Gaza until \"complete quiet\" has been achieved.<\/p> <p>  My first question is to the ambassador.  Does he accept that much of the violence is motivated by the forced expulsions and the violence that has been seen at the Al-Aqsa Mosque?  What does he expect to happen if Israel continues its policy - which has been in existence for decades - of removing people from land they have held?  Does he accept that Israel is provoking the situation?<\/p> <p>  My second point relates to the rules of engagement for the potential invasion of Gaza as set out by Israel, and some of the conflict or recent days and weeks which has resulted in 69 deaths in Gaza.  How does the ambassador distinguish between \"shielding\", which is a legalistic term that has implications, and urban warfare?  In a densely populated zone such as Gaza where over 2 million people live, how does he distinguish between shielding, which he has used to justify and explain the deaths of innocent civilians and combatants, and urban warfare?<\/p><p>If a Hamas militant is in a building, would that building automatically be made a legitimate target in Gaza?  Is the same standard applied to places where the IDF is in Israel?<\/p><p> My next question is to the former Minister for Defence, Mr. Shatter, and it concerns some of the rhetoric used by the current Israeli Minister of Defence, Mr. Benny Gantz, since his 2019 election campaign.  He might be aware of his 2019 election campaign video, which highlighted his credentials as a wartime general and referred to the actions taken by Israel in Gaza in 2014, of which he was a lead component.  His election video had a counter of the number of what he referred to as Hamas terrorists who died, which extended to 1,412.  Even by the IDF's own count, many of those were unrecognised victims.  Does Mr. Shatter believe that is an appropriate way for a minister of defence to behave or are such actions tantamount to provocation to inevitable war?<\/p><p> Ms Hausdorff referred to the 1967 Jordanian agreements and indicates the leaseholds held by the Palestinian residents being expelled from Sheikh Jarrah are only there since 1967.  If those leaseholds mean they do not have territorial rights to the land, does the witness believe these people have the right to return to the land from which they were displaced before that period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#J01000","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>We should all accept there is no such thing as one-sided war and no one side is ever on its own.  We should also acknowledge today that Ireland has significant interest in what goes on in the Middle East and has troops on the ground out there on all sides.  My thoughts are with them.<\/p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, Hamas is a terrorist group in the worst sense of the word insofar as it will throw anybody and anything in front of its desire for a victory in whatever part of the world it wishes to exist at any time.  I have absolutely no time for Hamas and what it does.  I ask the UN Security Council where Hamas is getting its weapons.  There are images of Palestine in bits and these people have tens of millions of euro in weapons for use against Israel.<\/p> <p>  I also state at this time that Ireland has now re-established what I would call good old-fashioned relationships with the United States so we are in a better position than we ever have been.  In Ireland, we lived with terrorism for 40 years and my own family suffered threats from terrorism.  I served in two armies and I know what it is like to be on the ground.<\/p> <p>  No war against terrorism can be won in the air and the likes of Hamas cannot be fought in the air.  Hamas is fully aware of the fact that when Israel sends rockets and jets to fire missiles in order to take out Hamas, civilians will also be taken out.  I am looking at reports now of 69 people killed, 17 of whom were children, and 390 people wounded, 86 of whom were children and 39 of whom were women.  No one side is responsible for this and no matter how much we might want, on either side of the argument, to clap ourselves on the back and say \"it was not our fault\", it is everybody's fault.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador is the most honourable man I have met in this country and his desire to represent his state is commendable.  I ask him if he is willing to go back to Israel and remind his government that the Irish people are his friends.  The Irish people have learned that one cannot win a terrorist war so one must work for peace.  It would be the most noble act for Israel to withdraw now from conflict; one side can call a truce and step back from the brink.  I ask that Israel does that.<\/p> <p>  The representations today were robust and I understand that willingness to defend the actions of people that we care for.  Deputy Brady showed some photographs of children and they should never be the victims in war.  I abhor war and hate everything about it.  I ask the witnesses to use their good offices to negotiate for peace at all levels.  I understand the annoyance and frustration felt by the witnesses when they hear Palestine represented in Ireland, as it is like no other side exists sometimes.  The Hamas group must be taken out.<\/p> <p>  Israel has one of the best-trained armies in the world and it should be possible to be far more focused in taking out those who threaten its country.  The people of Palestine have suffered but as has been pointed out in the submissions, I cannot imagine what it would be like to go to bed in Tel Aviv or some part of Israel tonight knowing that rockets are being fired indiscriminately into places of safety.  A home should be a safe place.<\/p> <p>  I am not taking sides but I understand both sides and the fear of people living in Israel with the threat of terrorism hanging over them.  I wish the people of Palestine would see that issue with Hamas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#K00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I am addressing the ambassador and the supporters of the Israeli project, state or whatever it is.  I am one of the people who think that state is a colonialist enterprise and that it is an apartheid state.  From its very beginning, it achieved its aims through the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people, something well documented by Professor Illan Papp&eacute; in his book, <i>The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine<\/i>, which indicates that between 1947 and 1948, 700,000 to 900,000 Palestinians - innocent people - were driven from their homes in less than a year.  They were driven from homes in villages and towns.<\/p><p>Some of those people were driven to places like Sheikh Jarrah, which is now at the centre of another attempt at ethnic cleansing by the Israeli state as it continues its advance to displace Palestinian people and take control of territory designated under the UN partition plan that has been mentioned as Palestinian territory.  That territory is within the green line and designated as Palestinian territory.  Israel continues to annex that territory, achieving that through the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.  Violence is used along with a twisted version of the law as the means to achieve those aims.<\/p><p>If my narrative is not true, please explain the basic law of the Israeli state, which is an apartheid law and which establishes supremacy for people of Jewish origin, establishing the state as a Jewish state.  Therefore, the 20% of inhabitants that are Palestinian are deemed, from a legal perspective, as second class citizens.  They are not on the same level as the Jewish population or treated as such.<\/p><p>Furthermore, if what I say is not true, will Israel allow all of the Palestinians and their descendants displaced in 1947 and 1948 to return to their homes and villages, as international law demands?  If, as Israel claims, the 600,000 to 700,000 settlers who have established themselves contrary to international law, contrary to the demands of Oslo and contrary to the appeals of the international community are really just about establishing Jewish settlements and Israel subsequently intends to hand over that territory for a Palestinian state, surely there is a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for all the, probably now, 4 million or 5 million people and their descendants, many of whom are living in refugee camps in Lebanon and Syria in the most desperate conditions and completely disenfranchised.  Surely, if Israel believes that Jew, Arab and Christian and indeed people of no religion, which by the way I certainly do, can and should live side by side with equal rights, then grant all those Palestinians and their descendants the right to return.  Then Israel's Orwellian narrative of trying to justify the continued annexation and ethnic cleansing of Palestinian territory might have some credibility.  Unless Israel actually confers equality in the basic laws of the state, whether one calls it Israel or Palestine, it is a fact that the ambassador's state is an apartheid state and it is a fact that it confers rights and privileges on one group because of its religion and nationality which it denies to others.  If I am wrong, let the ambassador tell us now that Palestinians will have the right to return to their homes and villages and that they will have equality.  Of course, the ambassador will not concede that.  There is no chance the ambassador will concede that.<br\/><br\/>For us to say that is not in any sense, by the way, as Israel often charges, motivated by anti-Semitism.  As I told one of the ambassador's predecessors, I lived in the Negev, in a moshav.  I went there completely without prejudice.  In fact, if anything, my prejudice was very much one of sympathy, as I still hold, for the historic plight of the Jews and the persecution they faced.  When I lived there, I worked side by side with Palestinians who I met in the first few days who were living in refugee camps and who had been displaced.  They and their families had been displaced in 1947 and 1948 and had lived in refugee camps ever since.  I saw the horrific treatment of those people, the endemic racism, the anti-Arab racism that is rife - rife - in mainstream Israeli society, the systematic discrimination and the fundamental denial of the right of the Palestinian families I met living refugee camps to be able to return to the towns and villages from which they were displaced using terror by Zionist militias in 1947 and 1948, using atrocities such as Deir Yassin where 200 people were murdered in their beds and the screams of those who were killed were broadcast in order to terrorise other Palestinians into leaving their home, as nearly 1 million did over a year.  If I am wrong, let Israel give the Palestinians the right to return.  Then Israel can show it is serious about peace and then, maybe, have some sort of peaceful negotiation.  Israel should stop trying to drive people out of places in which they live now, including Sheikh Jarrah.  They we could seriously talk about peace-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#K00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Thanks, Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#L00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Israel or Palestine is a place that deserves peace but the ambassador's state has shown no interest in actual peace and reconciliation with the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#L00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>We are experiencing some technical difficulty with Deputy Boyd Barrett but it happens to coincide with the expiry of the Deputy's time in any event.

There was a couple of questions directly put to me.  I listened carefully to the contributions, particularly what I would describe as the toxic contributions from Deputies Brady and Boyd Barrett which are regrettable.  They included nothing positive to contribute to a peaceful resolution and will do nothing to benefit the welfare of Palestinians or to end conflict.  I have heard the same speech for many years delivered by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Deputy Brady regularly produces the type of commentary I heard this morning in the toxic tweets that he engages in.  Let me deal with the particular questions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked me do I believe that Israelis and Palestinians should be treated as equals.  I have a simple answer to that.  The answer to that is, \"Yes\".  I believe that Israelis and Palestinians should be treated as equal.  I would like to see the implementation of a viable two-state solution.  I would like to see Hamas ceasing to be a terrorist organisation that oppresses Palestinians.<\/p> <p>  It is noteworthy that not a single contributor who is critical of Israel referenced the oppressive nature of the Hamas regime in Gaza, the arrest by Hamas of Gazan peace activists, their imprisonment for daring to talk peace to Israelis, the persecution of the gay community in Gaza and the threats Hamas issues to those who may take to protest on the streets in Gaza against Hamas.  There is a selective concern on the part of Deputies Brady and Boyd Barrett in particular for the welfare of Palestinians.  I have stood in Gaza following one of the conflicts talking to business people who before conflict had provided products, both to the people of Gaza and exports into Israel, who were terrified to publicly express their views but who wanted nothing but peace, wanted to restore their businesses and who were complaining about the corruption within Hamas in exploiting the tunnels to charge people tax to bring in product that they could not otherwise get because some of these products the Israelis were not allowing in because they were used to build weapons or tunnels.<\/p> <p>  I said what I heard on Tuesday was depressing.  What I have heard today is no less depressing because this is not about implementing a two-state solution or a peace process.  What this is solely focused on is something that Deputy Brady's party and, indeed, Deputy Boyd Barrett and some others have been engaged in for many years which is a campaign to de-legitimise and demonise the Israeli state.  Ironically, Sinn F&eacute;in, that advocates the self-determination of the Irish people, is apparently entirely opposed to the self-determination of the Jewish people and both Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Brady strenuously seek to avoid the reality that the UN resolution of 1947 envisaged the creation of Israel as a Jewish state, the one and only Jewish state in the world that has 52 Muslim states, and in a world in which many of those states exclude other religions and do not display the level of religious tolerance and understanding that applies in Israel to all of those who want to say prayers or worship within their own religions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Gannon put a question to me about some election video by Mr. Benny Gantz in 2018 being the provocation that has produced the current conflict.  There are moments in time when propositions presented are so ludicrous that one really has to step back.  One of the depressing things on Tuesday was no reference at all at any stage in a single question put to a single speaker to the then 800 rockets that had been fired into Israel.  As we stand this morning, there have been in excess of 1,300 rockets indiscriminately fired into Israel.  What it appears some members of the committee, including Deputy Brady, are advocating is that Israel has no right to defend itself, that Jewish people have no right to defend themselves, that the Israeli Government has no right to defend all the citizens of Israel, be they Jews, Christians or Muslims, and that, simply, it is open season for Hamas to fire as many rockets as it wishes and to rely on Iranian expertise and finance to process that.<\/p><p>I reject that as a proposition.  If I could say to Deputy Brady, who spoke at some length, one of the big tragedies is that Sinn F&eacute;in has learned nothing from the peace process.  Sinn F&eacute;in as a party, through its militant proxies in the Provisional IRA, was engaged in death and mayhem on this island for 30 years.  We eventually had the Good Friday Agreement which John Hume described as Sunningdale for slow learners.  What was learned was the need to understand the background to conflicts in their totality and the different understandings of those engaged in conflict who disagree.  Sinn F&eacute;in has something it could offer to those engaged in militant terrorism, namely, explaining the importance of ending violence, talking, people learning to live with each other and understand each other, and creating trust and moving to reconciliation.  What Sinn F&eacute;in, in the context of Deputy Brady and other members of his party who regularly tweet do, including Deputy Andrews who has tweeted regularly the words \"From the river to the sea\"-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Shatter","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Sorry, Chair, it is not appropriate for someone to call the questioning of human rights abuses toxic.

As I also mentioned in my opening remarks, a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians is in the vital interest of both sides.  That should be understood and internalised.  It is very difficult.  Unfortunately, during the last few years, we have seen the Palestinians avoiding going back to negotiating table.  As for the prospects for a solution, Israel has shown before that it is prepared to go very far and pay a very dear price when real peace is on the agenda.  We saw that in the peace agreement with Egypt and the huge territories that we gave back, including the uprooting of Israeli communities in the Sinai at the time and we saw it in Gaza where we unilaterally evacuated some 10,000 Israeli civilians there and uprooted whole communities.  We are willing to go very far to reach a sustainable and final agreement with the Palestinians that will enable both peoples to live in safety and security and, at the same time, fulfil their wishes and desires.  This is not easily achieved.<\/p> <p>  Some of the contributions we heard from committee members can work constructively towards this end.  On the other hand, we heard some spats of hate - I am sorry for the wording.  I do not know what they aspire to achieve.  We discussed how Ireland can contribute to a solution or progress.  While some contributions and attitudes expressed today were constructive to that end, others were totally destructive.  As I said, and Mr. Shatter also mentioned, it is sometimes very surprising and disappointing to hear such attitudes coming out of Ireland, of all places, where people have some painful experience of dealing with such complex conflicts.<\/p> <p>  The bottom line is that I think hope is there.  There is no other choice but hope for a solution between Israelis and Palestinians.  Israel will continue to do its utmost.  At the same time, maybe to the disappointment of some members, Israel will continue to preserve its interests and defend its citizens.  It is important that I emphasise again that we are working within international law and according to international law.  There might be disagreements around it but this is one of the major principles we are following.  <\/p> <p>  I ask for the Chair's guidance on whether there are any other specific points he would like me to answer in the very short time that I understand we have.

I thank the select committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today.  I welcome the opportunity to present this legislation to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill, I would like to emphasise that it is a key enabler for the new public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, and allows for a range of reforming pay matters, including implementation of aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Over the period since March 2020, the public service has stepped up to the challenge of the Covid-19 crisis and has delivered a world-class response.  Public servants have adapted and readjusted the way in which services are delivered so as to minimise the negative impact of the pandemic on the public.<\/p> <p>  In that regard, Building Momentum recognises the value of the work of our public servants during this pandemic and provides for affordable increases with pay adjustments weighted toward those on lower incomes.  The agreement also sets out a reform agenda.  Each sector will produce and publish reform plans that will demonstrate delivery each year and payment of a 1% sectoral fund will be conditional on the delivery of actual reforms.<\/p> <p>  As noted, the Bill will also enable progress on a range of pay reform matters, including Sl&aacute;intecare.  A key objective of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation process is to remove consultant private practice from public hospitals.  Central to implementation of this reform is a move to public-only consultant contracts and to tailor that contract to align with wider Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.<\/p><p>The new contract, noting the significant reforms involved, is to offer an increased pay level.  A consultation process with the medical unions on the new contract has commenced.  Members will have heard the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, speak about that earlier this week.<\/p><p> These measures, which support reform, recruitment and retention in particular areas of our public service, cannot be progressed to payment under existing FEMPI Acts.  This underscores the need for this amending legislation.  In summary terms, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provides that no change can be made in the pay of a public servant without legislative amendment, a court order or a determination that there is a legal entitlement to a pay increase.  While it is possible to set a pay rate for a new grade or post, it is not possible to change the pay of an existing public servant in post.  This Bill, therefore, provides for amendment of those restrictions on increases to public service pay introduced by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.<\/p><p> I will now outline the details of the legislation.  Section 1 sets out a definition of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 as the \"Act of 2009\".  Section 2 amends section 4 of the Act of 2009 to provide that in addition to changes to pay arising from an Act of the Oireachtas, an order of the civil courts, an order of the Labour Court or a determination that there is a legal entitlement to a pay increase, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may sanction increases in the pay or allowances of public servants.<\/p><p> Section 3 amends section 5 of the Act of 2009 to provide for retrospective application, up to the date on which this proposed Act is enacted, of a provision allowing for amendment of contracts of employment to increase pay.  Section 4 amends section 16A of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 2011 to ensure that where a contract of employment is amended in accordance with section 4 of the Act of 2009, as amended by this proposed Act, no further ministerial sanction is required under the Ministers and Secretaries Act 2011.  Section 5 provides that the Short Title of the proposed Act is the Public Service Pay Act 2020.<\/p><p> Prior to this Committee Stage consideration, section 5 of the Bill provided for amendment of section 24(3) of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 to align the date for repeal of section 5(1) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 with the date on which this proposed Act is enacted.  However, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provided for the repeal of section 5(1) of the 2009 Act on 1 January 2021.  Section 5 had been included on the basis that the Bill was drafted and published in 2020, in advance of the date of 1 January 2021 and to avoid inconsistency in the removal of restrictions on pay.<\/p><p> Noting that arising from the passage of time, section 5(1) was repealed on 1 January 2021, this element of the Bill is moot and an amendment is proposed to remove same, remove a reference to the 2017 Act in the Long Title and renumber the Bill accordingly.  It is a purely technical amendment which we can discuss when we come to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#A00500","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I will allow opening remarks from any members of the committee who wish to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#B00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as teacht os comhair na coiste seo.

We are reverting to a more normal era of industrial relations and hopefully agreeing pay deals into the future.  It is in the interests of all concerned if we can do it in an orderly way and give public servants certainty about their own pay.  From the State's point of view, having stability and certainty in our overall public service pay bill for a period ahead is also an important part of managing the public finances for the future.<\/p> <p>  This is a relatively short agreement, shorter than some previous agreements in recent times.

As members know they are in housing in particular and climate action measures.  We have to ensure the national development plan is consistent with Project Ireland 2040.  That is also a key requirement.  Then when it comes to spending on individual projects, we have to ensure we are getting value for money.  We are now in an era of significant construction inflation.  We have introduced reforms that will come into effect in the period ahead whereby we are bringing in a major projects advisory group to support the work of my Department.  We will also be advertising shortly in an open public competition for external members to join the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board so that they can complement the skills and experience of the Secretaries General who are currently serving on that board.  We have updated the public spending code in recent times to strengthen the oversight of public spending.  It is not always about the quantum.  The quantum is important and will be ambitious.  It will be confirmed in the new national development plan that we will publish in July.  We will lay out what each Department will be getting for the next five years and, in addition, what the overall amount is out to 2030.<\/p> <p>  We will see a re-prioritisation in line with the programme for Government.

I hope that over the course of June we can complete the content and agree on what the ceilings are for the coming years.  I am satisfied that it will match the ambition the IMF has called on us to meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#C00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>While we are at an all-time high now in terms of capital expenditure, the reality is that we were lagging so far behind and we have had a significant infrastructural deficit in this State for so long.  It has been decades-long.  I welcome that the IMF has said this and that the penny has dropped in the sense that we need to grow out rather than have austerity.<\/p> <p>  Many people are raising another question with me at the moment.  It is of deep concern for people.  It relates to the pandemic unemployment payment and business supports.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have said there will be no cliff edge.  The Minister has also said that we will know the outline in the coming weeks.  There is, however, a problem for businesses.  I have been speaking to the people involved.  They do not have the luxury of waiting for several weeks to see what will happen.  They are concerned.  Businesses, including hotels and so on have to plan for the coming year.  People need to know whether they can pay the rent or mortgage next month.  It is of deep concern to people.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister provide more clarity?  Can he provide assurance to people that this will go on longer term?  Does the Minister see this going on?  The Minister says there will be no cliff edge and is talking about tapering off.  Is he talking about tapering off pre-budget?  Are the changes referenced pre-budget?  Will it go on longer to the extent that it would it be included in the next budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#C00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I will add a question or two - it is too inviting to allow the occasion to pass.

As committee members know, under the 2017 Act the pathway for the unwinding of FEMPI cuts was laid out.  There are complexities but in simple terms people earning up to &euro;70,000 at this point have had full restoration.  Those earning between &euro;70,000 and &euro;150,000 under the 2017 Act are to have restoration by July this year.  Then the remainder of the FEMPI tail, as it is called, is to be dealt with in 2022.  I can provide further detail on those issues if committee members wish.<\/p> <p>  One issue I have been looking at is the overall need for retention of the FEMPI legislation given that we are now in the process of unwinding the reductions imposed under the FEMPI Acts.  Some provisions in the FEMPI Acts will now become defunct but other provisions are still valid and needed.  These relate to a legal basis for the benefits of the public service agreements up to 2020, a legal basis for pay restoration to continue to 1 July 2022 and several definitions in the FEMPI Acts relating to public servants, public bodies and so on.  I can provide a more technical briefing on that point if people wish.  In broad terms we are well down the road of unwinding the FEMPI cuts.  It has been completed for those up to &euro;70,000.  We regard those above that level as the FEMPI tail.<\/p><p>The Act lays out what needs to be done in 2021 and 2022.  They are issues on which I have been engaging with the Attorney General in regard to legal advice and so on.  There will be further restoration later this year in respect of the FEMPI.<\/p><p> On infrastructure, we will look right across the span of Departments and sectors.  As I signalled earlier, the core priorities will be housing, climate action, transport, education and health.  All the areas will be dealt with as part of the NDP review.  We will give Departments certainty as to their budgets for the next five years because it takes time to plan the delivery of projects through the pipeline.  We will then lay out the overall capital budget for each year beyond that, that is, for the second half of the new ten-year plan.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Farrell in regard to the continuation of the supports, the position remains as we have outlined.  We are working through the detail and examining different scenarios.  We expect to come to a conclusion in the next two to three weeks and will then lay out the plan for the supports beyond the end of June.  I restate there will be no cliff edge or abrupt end.  We are deeply conscious of the importance of those supports for people who remain unemployed because of the pandemic.  For many of them, their jobs will not have come back by the end of June and I have said publicly we will have to take account of that.  Not every sector will have had an opportunity to reopen fully, so we are conscious of how vital that form of income is for people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own.<\/p><p> Equally, on the issue of the business supports, there are decisions to be made on the employment wage subsidy scheme, the local authority rates waiver and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  The third issue will kind of work itself out, depending on whether businesses will be allowed to open.  The key one is the employment wage subsidy scheme, which is supporting the employment of more than 300,000 people.  It comes at a cost, of close to &euro;400 million a month, but we need to be very careful in the changes we make because we do not want to result in people moving from the wage subsidy scheme to the PUP.  We believe the retention of the connection between employer and employee is vital.  The scheme has been a lifesaver and will have a role to play into the future.  Any changes we will need to make will be laid out in the next two to three weeks.<\/p><p> In overall terms, these supports are temporary in nature.  We cannot continue indefinitely with emergency-level expenditure.  The stability programme update, on a technical basis, sets out the full unwinding of Covid-related spending by the end of next year, but it will be for the Government to make decisions in the weeks ahead that take account of all the issues the Deputy raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#C00600","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I am conscious we are here to debate Committee Stage, with one amendment proposed to the Bill, but as the Vice Chairman said, it is an opportunity to discuss the national development plan and, to a greater extent, infrastructural investment over the coming years.  I am glad to hear the Minister outline areas such as public transport, health and housing.  The retrofitting of houses will create significant long-term employment and investment in such areas, not to mention offshore renewable which has potential for the creation of jobs through electrifying transport and how we heat our houses.  There are good long-term prospects for sustainable and clean jobs, which is really good, and there is a high-multiplier effect from investing money wisely in that.  The Minister will recall that when he appeared previously before the committee, he mentioned the European recovery and resilience fund but we did not have an opportunity at that stage to discuss it.  That fund will have a very positive impact.  He covered much of the infrastructural investment and we are all aware of where we would like that to go.<\/p> <p>  Digitisation is also a part of that recovery fund and will be very important.  We have seen the reliance on the digital communications in the country and where the deficits are.  People who have been working from home have struggled in cases where they do not have good communications infrastructure, such as Wi-Fi, broadband and so on.  I met representatives of National Broadband Ireland recently and am quite impressed by the fibre-to-door design being rolled out.  There is no limit on fibre.  The limit is the receivers and transmitters and they are always upgradable.  Fibre-to-door is a decades-long investment that will really pay back.<\/p> <p>  In many urban areas where we thought there was high-speed broadband, excessive loads were experienced during the day when everybody was working from home.  There were digital patches and blackspots in urban areas and contention on the line where it was not the single fibre to the door that everybody has.  That is an area we need to prioritise.  Obviously, rural broadband has been left behind for many years and I fully support accelerating the roll-out of that to everybody, but there is work to be done in many of the urban centres too.  I hope part of the recovery and resilience fund will be used for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#D00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I strongly agree with the Deputy's sentiments on the importance of issues such as retrofitting.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that a large share of the proceeds we get from increases in carbon tax to 2030 will be ring-fenced for that purpose.  I have been working closely with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to get the infrastructure right.  For example, we greatly enhanced the capacity of the SEAI in decisions we made in the most recent budget because it will be a significant undertaking to achieve the critical mass of coverage that we need in retrofitting.  That will be an important part of the new national development plan.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy touched on public transport.  It goes without saying that will be vital in the new NDP.  I agree there is considerable potential in the area of offshore renewables.  The new marine planning Bill and the new marine framework being introduced are critical.  We need to modernise the regulatory, approval and licensing regime that governs that area to ensure that projects can commence and get through the various stages because it takes too long at present.  I look forward to seeing the progression of that Bill through the Oireachtas as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  On the recovery and resilience plan, we are in the final stages of our engagement with the European Commission and expect to lodge the formal plan very soon.  It involves a range of exciting projects, in both the green transition space and digitisation.  There has been much progress in the past year or so in the provision of public services online and there will be further investment in that area.  We have been working closely with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer on projects that can be delivered through the national recovery and resilience plan.  We will receive grants, in today's value terms, of about &euro;915 million over this year and next year and it will have to involve a balance of investments and reforms.  We are at a very advanced stage.  The Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner Dombrovskis, wrote to me recently commending Ireland on the work we are doing and encouraged us to continue to work with the Commission.  I expect we will submit that plan soon and, once it has been formally approved, it will involve the release of significant funding that will allow us to support some really exciting projects in further and higher education, digitisation, transport, retrofitting and a range of environmental measures.

However, the 2017 Act provided for the repeal of section 5(1) of the 2009 Act on 21 January.  Section 5 had been included on the basis that the Bill was drafted and published in 2020 in advance of 1 January 2021, and that was to avoid inconsistency in the removal of the restrictions on pay, so noting that arising from the passage of time, section 5(1) was actually repealed on 1 January 2021 by virtue of the 2017 Act.
