Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask that committee members confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.<\/p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.<\/p><p>Today, we will examine the 2019 financial statements of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Areas of interest to members, which An Bord Plean&aacute;la<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>have been made aware of, include strategic housing developments, the judicial review process, the regular objection process and staffing levels at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To assist us in our examination of the 2019 financial statements, we are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la: Mr. Dave Walsh, chairperson, Mr. Gerard Egan, director of corporate affairs and Ms Anne Killian, finance officer.  They are all very welcome. <\/p><p>When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. <\/p><p>Before I start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask the witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.<\/p><p>I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021051300002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620894600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Under the Planning and Development Acts, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is responsible for the determination of appeals of local authority planning decisions, and for the determination of direct planning applications for strategic housing and infrastructure development.

We will endeavour to address all queries as best we can.  With the indulgence of the committee, I may ask my colleagues to come in on some more technical matters as they are more familiar and have the detailed information to hand.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman outlined, it is important to remind the committee that it is not appropriate to discuss individual planning cases, as to do so could compromise decisions and various judicial review cases before the courts.  However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will aim to be as helpful as we can to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The board is well aware of its critical role in the planning system in considering, and determining, appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals.  We remain committed to delivering robust decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  We are also cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities.  I can confirm that the board considers itself in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.<\/p> <p>  We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee and internal audits, as well as undertaking regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risk and mitigation actions.  As is required under the code of practice, I receive a report annually from the independent external chair of the audit and risk committee and the committee's most recent report has confirmed that our risk management processes and internal controls are operating effectively.  As chairperson, I am also reassured of our financial and governance controls through the unqualified audit opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General both for 2019 and for all previously audited years.<\/p> <p>  The committee will have noted from our annual accounts that in financial terms, the board had a total income of over &euro;25 million in 2019, comprised, as Mr. McCarthy has said, of an Exchequer grant of &euro;18.6 million and - there is a correction there - of fee revenue of just under &euro;6.4 million.  This represents an increase from 2018, when we received &euro;17.5 million in Exchequer grants and took in just over &euro;3 million in fee revenue.<\/p> <p>  To give a little background on the organisation, the board currently has 175.3 whole-time equivalent staff and nine board members.  The Minister and the Department have been very supportive in approving recent resource requests in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments and major infrastructure projects.  The board is currently engaging with the Department on an updated workforce plan for 2021-22 to meet its evolving needs and work demands.<\/p> <p>  The board's primary role is to make planning decisions in a timely and efficient manner in accordance with the legislative framework under which we operate and having regard to the overarching planning policy framework as determined by the Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  While I appreciate that we are discussing the 2019 annual report and accounts, I would like to give the committee a more up-to-date picture of our casework levels using 2020 statistics.<\/p> <p>  The year 2020 was very challenging for the board, as it was for many organisations and for society generally, with major disruptions to normal life and work practices due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, despite these disruptions, the board was able to remain open for business throughout the various lockdowns with planning designated as an essential service by the Government.<\/p><p>Moreover, with the co-operation and goodwill of board members, staff and the various active participants in the planning system, including the public, we were able to keep our public office open in a safe manner and were able to maintain a fairly high level of case output.  We adapted our practices to enable some online services and virtual meetings, including the holding of remote oral hearings, and facilitated hybrid office-home working patterns for all staff to ensure that we fully adhered to all health and safety requirements to protect everyone.<\/p><p> While the total number of cases received and decided were down slightly on the 2019 totals, due in part to the eight-week planning timeline extensions in April and May, 76% of all planning appeal cases were decided within the statutory objective period, SOP.  This is a significant achievement, considering the overall challenging operational environment in which the staff and board members were working, and represents a further improvement on the comparable 2019 figure of 69%, and well ahead of the 43% compliance rate recorded back in 2018.<\/p><p> Looking back on 2020, with nine of its months significantly impacted by Covid-19 related restrictions, and many of these effects continuing well into 2021, I am hugely proud of the commitment, resilience and efforts by our entire board and staff in keeping the show on the road through progressing and deciding cases.  The challenge is now to maintain this level of compliance amidst the ongoing disruptions due to Covid restrictions, to further streamline our systems, as well as to adapt to more flexible working patterns and practices.  Thus far this year, case activity in the first three months of 2021 has been fairly busy, with 781 new application and appeal cases lodged and 631 cases disposed, which suggests a similar caseload over the course of this year, as the economy recovers following the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p> In relation to strategic housing developments, SHDs, the board has continued to prioritise these and we decided 126 such applications during 2020, all within the statutory timelines.  Of these cases, 98 decisions were to grant permission, facilitating more than 25,400 residential units, three quarters of which were for apartments, as well as 2,300 student bed spaces and some 570 shared accommodation bed spaces.  It is also important to note that the board refused 28 of the applications decided last year, evidence that the board continues to assess all applications against the principles of proper planning and sustainable development and refuses those that fail these criteria.  The increasing numbers of pre-application consultations would suggest that 2021 will see a further increase in SHD applications between now and when the legislative scheme expires early next year.<\/p><p> Similarly, building on the 24 strategic infrastructure applications received in 2020 and the 19 cases decided, the trend in pre-applications in 2020 and so far this year would indicate more infrastructural projects being lodged with us in the near future.<\/p><p> Amidst all the Covid-related disruptions, the board was able to progress our major IT transformational project, Plean-IT, with the establishment of an in-house development team to drive forward further enhancements and functionality within the system.  While the ultimate aim is to facilitate the online submission of applications and appeals, aligned with the planning authorities&rsquo; e-planning initiative, we were able to advance a number of important developments during 2020 and into 2021, such as the launch last November of our online facility enabling observations on strategic housing development applications and the design of a more user-friendly and informative website designed to make it easier for everyone to find the information that they are looking for and to provide useful guidance on how to lodge or comment on an strategic development application or planning appeals.  The new website was launched last month and the board is pleased with the largely positive feedback in this initial phase.  We expect further phased roll-out of online services this year and into 2022.<\/p><p>I am conscious that I am taking up members&rsquo; valuable time to raise specific issues so I will leave it there.  We have provided some statistics and charts in the appendix to the opening statement and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021051300002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620894600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Deputy Verona Murphy is the first speaker, she has 15 minutes, Deputy Dillon is next with ten minutes and everyone thereafter has five minutes.

Of the 4,334 houses encompassed in the residential unit delivery of 16,600, about 1,200 were semi-detached houses, possibly with a garden.  The rest were terraced housing, just over 3,200.  The densities being applied are resulting in family-unfriendly homes.   As for the section on legal proceedings, I was in business for 30-odd years and when looking at overall costs, one looks at the highest costs to see what can be done about them.  I was pretty overwhelmed when I saw the figure for legal fees of almost &euro;3.5 million.  It is extraordinary.  It accounts for 17% of the contribution from the Exchequer of just over &euro;18 million.  It is the biggest expense after salaries.  I also note that &euro;1.78 million of that was paid out in third-party settlements.  I find that unbelievable.

In many cases, the judicial review process could be seen to be the normal appeal process where an SHD has been granted.  In the context of the overall numbers since the SHD process was commissioned and began in 2017, the board has made around 280 decisions and I think about 54 of those have been judicially reviewed.  About one sixth of the decisions taken, therefore, have been challenged in the courts.

I think that is the case when anything new is brought in.  When strategic infrastructure was introduced in 2007 to allow for large-scale applications directly to the board, there was a significant increase in the number of challenges being taken on wind farms and major industrial developments.

That was considered to be an incredibly serious matter.  The process for that involved councillors meeting in public session and the rationale in terms of the proposition to take a different course than recommended being clearly outlined.  The positions of each councillor would be then minuted and the votes identified in the minutes.  It would be extensively reported in local media.

I go back to when Plean-IT started, which was way back in 2014.  At that stage, it was a proposed cost for five years of just under &euro;3 million, or &euro;2.934 million.  That was broken down into consultancy work for scoping.  In the first year, I understand there were some delays due to the tender process and in order to get the correct people, and then the project was up and running.  In 2014, the spend was quite low and, again, the spend was quite low in 2015.  It was mainly what we would call consumables in that we were assessing what we needed.  We capitalise what we build, so it would be later on in the project that there would be more capital spend.  It moved into 2016, where the spend was &euro;572,000.  In 2017, there was a larger capital build because that is when the Plean-IT system was being fully geared up to go live, and it went live in October 2017.  We then moved on to 2018.  The capital cost dipped at that stage and we moved to rolling it out, getting it functional and getting more functions involved, such as bulk uploads and different bundles the designers had been working on, and the consultants were engaged in assessing what scope we required.  In 2019, there was a spend of &euro;568,346 in total.  Capital is &euro;139,000 or &euro;140,000 of that, and there are consumables.  At that stage, the in-house developers moved in on the process, so there was a bigger consumable spend at that stage.<\/p> <p>  A reassessment was done in October 2020, looking at the spend to date.  With all the different changes that were required as the years passed and the needs changed, we had a six-year spend which was coming out at &euro;3.4 million.

It is very timely in the context of the marine Bill moving through the Oireachtas.  We have obviously adapted our systems and capacity to ensure that we have the right skill set, as well as the numbers to process efficiently any applications or appeals that come to us.  As I indicated, the Department and the Minister have been very supportive in ensuring that we have received approval for the resources, both financial and staffing, in recent years.<\/p> <p>  In our submission we outlined that we have a workforce plan currently before the Department for consideration.  As part of that, we acknowledge and recognise the challenge that the board and the wider public system face in terms of ensuring that any infrastructure projects that are critical to economic recovery and delivery of the national development plan can be expedited and prioritised.  Marine is a brand new function, so what we are proposing as part of our workforce plan is to create a marine and climate unit to deal with renewables and climate in order to have the expertise to draw on, both internally within the organisation and, where we need particular expertise on hydrological issues or fisheries expertise, that we have panels of people on which to draw.

There may have been flaws in it but the system existed.  Individual planning applications that did not belong to the local authority itself were decided by the professional planners.

Anecdotally, is it An Bord Plean&aacute;la's view that on many of these sites where permission is granted for a developer to develop large numbers of houses, bypassing the local authority structure, the developer subsequently sits on the planning permission and now has a more valuable asset in hand and will simply flip that to the highest bidder when the time is right?<\/p> <p>  We know that house prices are accelerating at the moment.

To come back to my earlier points, I will deal with the example of a refusal by the local authority, but it could as easily be an approval.  A type of development might be precluded by the county development plan, a plan whose development would have involved an enormous level of public consultation and a great amount of deliberation at local authority level based on the advice of officials, which may be adopted by members of the local authority.  Let us take the case of a developer making a proposal to the local authority.  This developer will probably engage in preplanning consultation and, after submitting the application, further information may be sought.  Another process may go on for six months in which attempts are made to resolve issues.  At the end of the day, the local authority planners may nonetheless decide that the development is inappropriate for a given location.  An appeal may then be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and then the board's inspector, having visited and looked at all the evidence, may decide to recommend that the local authority's decision be upheld.  There will then be a meeting with three representatives, two of whom - who will remain unnamed - may decide to overturn the recommendation of their own inspector and the local authority's decision, while providing minimal information as to how they came to that decision.  It is quite possible that these representatives will never have set foot in the county, never mind having looked at the site in question.

In 2019, we met more than 800 times as a board tribunal.  There were multiple meetings going on.  It is not practical for the board to go out to every single site.  That is why we have a team of 60 inspectors who give us their views.  We look not only at the inspector's report but at all of the information provided, including the local authority's observations, any commentary from State agencies, submissions from observers and so on.  The Oireachtas has designed a system which allows us to use the collective expertise of the board to determine cases.  We have a range of skills.

Representatives of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, appeared before the committee on 20 April.

However, at 4 p.m. on 16 April 2021, there was no issue whatsoever in relation to the weighing of fish but by 5 p.m. there was a change in the weighing of fish, which has been detrimental to the inshore fishermen, to the pelagic fisherman.

There has been an ongoing process in relation to this for a significant period of time.  It goes back initially to an audit, which was carried out by the European Commission in 2018, followed then by an administrative inquiry in 2019, which the Commission carried out.  We got the results of that administrative inquiry just before Christmas.  In that, the Commission indicated that it did not have confidence that the systems we had in place were robust enough in terms of ensuring compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy regulations.  It also indicated its intention to revoke the control plan, and that is the position it was in.  The Commission's final decision would have been communicated to us at the same time as the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  Obviously, that was a Commission decision and not one which the SFPA would have decided on.  It was one which followed on from administrative inquiry the Commission carried out.  The main impact of it is that it means that we cannot do the in-factory weighing, which the derogation control plan provided for.  That has undoubtedly has had a significant impact on fishers and on processors in relation to the weighing of fish.  It has had an impact on some piers more than others, depending on where the factories are and it means that weighing has to happen before transport.  It does not revoke the sampling plan, which applies to the whitefish sector, but it requires the sampling plan.  If they are being transported away from the pierside for weighing, it is required to be used.  I do not diminish for a second the challenge this has led to for the sector.  I know the SFPA has been consulting with all fishers, companies, stakeholders and food business operators in relation to its impact.  I know it outlined to the committee earlier this week the process involved in reinstating a control plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021051300002#A00800","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, and I respect that, but is he  saying he was made aware of this before Christmas?

We are in a situation where it was two months before we were told; it could have been three or four months.  We were told two months before a decision is going to be made what is going to happen.  These two months are going to be detrimental to inshore fishing and hugely difficult to all fishermen, for that matter.  It looks to me as though there was a decision made in Europe at Christmas.  Whether it was opposed or argued, I cannot answer that.  However, January, February, March and April went by and the industry was not notified that there could be changes or that there was a concern.

Until such time as  it does that and brings it through its process and notify us of it, it will not happen.  It will only be whenever it does that, it will happen.  Unfortunately, that puts an onus in dealing with the new situation.  Some interim time was provided - I think it runs until 1 June 2021 - following on from the revocation of the control plan for the competent authority, which is SFPA, to engage with fishers and processors and to respond to and deal with the new situation.

In terms of the national statutory instrument, it is not within the competence of Ireland, as a member state, to provide ourselves with our own derogation from the control plan.  The regulations around this are set by the European Commission and, under the Common Fisheries Policy, there is an obligation on each member state, through the relevant competent authorities, in our case the SFPA, to apply those regulations.  We are legally obliged to comply with them under the Common Fisheries Policy and every member state must do the same.<\/p> <p>  The control plan was put in place in 2012 and, from that point on, under a derogation within it, the control plan provided for weighing in-factory as opposed to weighing at-pier, and this was approved by the Commission.  Now that the Commission has revoked that control plan, we default to the default scenario of having to apply the regulations without derogations under a national control plan.  Without a new control plan being put in place and agreed by the Commission, we have to apply the rules as they stand and the Common Fisheries Policy regulations as they stand.  There will have to be engagement with the Commission in terms of moving forward with a new control plan, and I know the SFPA outlined the process involved in that when it met with the committee on Tuesday.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the PwC report, we have discussed on a number of occasions the organisational challenges within the SFPA, the steps that were taken in terms of the conducting of that PwC report and how the organisation can reform itself and deal with some of the issues that were identified in the report.  There are many key recommendations within that and there is an implementation committee and an advisory committee which are working with the SFPA in regard to implementing that.  It has also brought on board a new member of staff to assist with the implementation of that report.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the recent appointment of the head of the SFPA to a role in the European authority, that was an open competition and is a reflection on the person's capacity to win through that open competition.

We are talking about somebody's livelihood potentially being taken away and, certainly, their reputation being affected.  The threshold of the balance of probabilities is a serious issue.<\/p> <p>  I want to link that to the issues that Deputy Collins raised.  There is a situation where three national media outlets with wide circulation were clearly presented with this EU audit report, which covers a period from 2012 to 2015 and was submitted in 2018.  Clearly, they were provided with this report and that led them to report that there was mass overfishing in the Irish industry by tens of thousands of tonnes.  This was at a time when we had lost major quota as a result of Brexit and where we had an industry under the cosh, and it is reported that they have been overfishing and have been messing around with weighing scales, and that the State needs to give back tens of millions.<\/p> <p>  It made for brutal reading yet nobody in the industry has been given a copy of this report.  Can the Minister imagine that I had placed charges against him which affected his reputation and his livelihood, and he was given none of the evidence to justify those charges?  Three national media outlets were clearly given a report that the industry has not been given.  I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister and he confirmed that he cannot provide this report.<\/p> <p>  We then have the SFPA administrative inquiry, which we understand confirms that this report is correct and endorses it.  That leads us to this real crisis that affects every single pier and harbour across the State.

Ireland is a member state within the European Union and, as a country, we represent our industry and our sector.  Domestically, the SFPA is the competent authority for enforcement and applying and overseeing the Common Fisheries Policy and the regulations within that.  It is clear and is public knowledge that the Commission has publicly published its findings from the administrative inquiry, in particular the three or four pages indicating it has come to a conclusion around the revocation of the control plan.  It has outlined that, as a result of the administrative inquiry and the audit prior to that, it did not have confidence in regard to the control systems we had in place, in particular the weighing systems.  As a member state, we have to defend that and engage with the Commission on its findings.  It is Ireland, as a member state, that the finding is against, as opposed to an individual fisher or the industry.  Therefore, we have to respond and engage with the Commission in response to that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right in regard to the impact this has on the sector, and we have seen that in regard to the administrative revocation of the control plan and the impact that has had.  There has been much comment also on the potential for a repayment of fish emerging from that and for this also to be part of the outcome of the administrative inquiry of the Commission.<\/p> <p>  The administrative inquiry is a legal process under EU law whereby the Commission engages the member state directly, and that is a legal process between both.

I think he knows that it is appalling that this report has been leaked and reported on at national level and the industry has had no chance to defend itself by seeing the actual evidence.  The industry protests that it is the most regulated.  The submission from the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association spoke to the committee last Tuesday.  It states the industry is the most regulated in Europe, far from being this kind of Wild West of over-fishing.  As I stated on Tuesday, I had the opportunity recently to observe for myself the weighing system at a fish factory in Killybegs, County Donegal.  It is state-of-the-art technology.  There are a number of seals around the weighing device to prevent it from being tampered with, there are CCTV cameras observing all the fish as they are weighed in real time and those monitors feed directly to the SFPA offices.  That is a remarkable level of oversight.  Then, at the back end of the factory, one can see packages with 20 kg of fish, with 60 on each trolley, weighing 1.2 tonnes.  One can go into the freezer.  Industry representatives say they are most regulated fish processors in Europe and it far from the Wild West.  The processors allow free access into their factory.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland can make unannounced inspections at any time to make sure the proper weighing device is being used.  I was taken aback.  I cannot think of any industry in this country that is subject to that level of oversight by the regulator, with CCTV cameras watching everything and officials able to come in at any time.  The industry accepts that is what needs to be done to clear its name.<\/p> <p>  I understand the SFPA, the regulator, has not prosecuted any factory, and there are plenty of them throughout the State.  No factory has been prosecuted in a court of law.  There may have been one case, which is disputed, through the NSAI.  That involves one factory at one moment across the entire State, yet we have allowed a situation where our reputation has been tarnished and our industry accused of being like the Wild West.  Our factories are not on the pier and harbour as in other European countries and the fish have to be transported in a way that does not damage them, because no one wants to damage the value particularly when margins are getting tighter and tighter, along with the quotas.  They have to be transported from the pier or harbour.  Fish have to be weighed without water.  There is state-of-the-art technology and complete oversight, but having witnessed this myself, I cannot get my head around how the SFPA officials did not beat their chests about how they are the best regulators in Europe and how the industry is subject to unbelievable oversight and there is nothing to worry about because we can make damn sure no overfishing is permitted.  No Oireachtas Member would have any tolerance for illegality or overfishing when this precious resource must be maintained; what we want is more of it in Irish waters for our Irish fishers.  We do not want overfishing and the destruction of species in our waters.  However, we want a greater share for Irish fishers.<\/p> <p>  I will not ask any more questions as that was a very long synopsis.  Does the Minister accept that the SFPA, an organisation whose structures and organisation was recently subject to a damning review, have serious questions to answer having allowed this profound failing?  Whatever his comments today, I ask him to do something about it.  Will he amend the legislation before us to put in place an independent board to oversee the SFPA?  He could do that by tabling an amendment.  It would make the authority get its act together and do its job, and not allow our industry to be tarnished when it should be held up an example for its practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021051300002#C00200","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I fully understand the challenges that the revocation of our control plan represents for the sector, particularly the white fish sector, which are very difficult indeed.  The committee had a thorough discussion on this with the SFPA earlier in the week.  Operational matters relating to weighing coming under its remit, not mine as Minister.  Legally I am precluded from being involved in operational matters, and as an Oireachtas Member, Deputy Mac Lochlainn will understand that.  We are in this situation because of the findings of he audit and administrative inquiry carried out by the Commission.  That is the reality we must deal with and on which I am engaged with them.  A legal process is ongoing on that, in which I am representing ourselves as a member state, and defending and representing our position.  That is ongoing.  It does not take away from the fact that fisheries is massively regulated, as we all know.  I sat on this committee for four years and had many engagements on this.  Being from a fisheries county, the same as Deputy Mac Lochlainn, and being closely in contact with fishers throughout my political career, I know how regulated the industry is.  That is the situation in Ireland as it is in member states where the Common Fisheries Policy applies.  There are quotas for every species, they have to be weighed and monitored. which involves significant red tape and imposes a large administrative burden on those operating in the industry.<\/p> <p>  We find ourselves in a very challenging position as a member state under the Common Fisheries Policy.  As a result of the administrative inquiry, despite the regulation we have in place, the Commission found that operators did not have in place a weighing system that was fit for purpose.  Consequently it found the control plan did not minimise the risk of systematic manipulation of weighing so it did not have confidence that it was sufficiently robust to be fully effective.  That is what the Commission has found and that is what we have to deal with in the revocation of the control plan and ensuring a new control plan is put in place, which the SFPA will be in charge of, that addresses the Commission's findings in its administrative inquiry.  That is the situation we are in.  It is really challenging and very difficult.  There are other aspects to the administrative inquiry findings such as the potential for repayment of fish, which is currently part of the legal process and which I am defending on behalf of Ireland.  This is the situation I have to deal with and the sector must deal with as well because that is the reality of the Commission's findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021051300002#C00300","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.  My questions will be in the same vein as those asked by some other committee members.  When many Members of the Oireachtas who are not members of this committee feel it is important to add their voices, it shows the significance of and frustration around this issue.<\/p> <p>  I have been an elected politician for almost 20 years.  In my political career, I have never known fishers to be so annoyed as they are by the recent proposal.  All of the people in the industry who sent me emails and made phone calls said that they were fully compliant with the new regulations, they were heavily regulated by the SFPA, there had been major changes over the past ten, 15 or 20 years - they were not happy with all of those changes, but they waded in behind them - and their costs had increased.  Now, they are being asked to weigh their fish on the pier.  There are good reasons not to do that.  This issue has annoyed those in the industry.  If something is not done by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and common sense does not prevail, fishers will take drastic action that will force the Department into going back to allowing them to weigh in factories.<\/p> <p>  I will give the example of Kilmore pier in south County Wexford.  It is a large pier and sees a considerable amount of fishing activity.  If every fisher is asked to weigh fish on the pier, a health and safety issue will arise.  The pier is accessible to the general public, including children.  Fishers could instead travel less than 500 m up the road to the processors or factories.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  How many processors and factories have been prosecuted over the past one, five, ten or 20 years because of a weighing issue?  One sector is being pitted against another.  Some sectors are blaming another for what is happening across the board.  This is having an impact that is annoying to the industry.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is aware that Ireland is known for its quality, fresh fish.  Weighing fish on the quayside will take that status away from us.  The quality will not be as good and the fish will not be as fresh.

Is it the case that there are a few rogue factories but the whole industry is being painted with the same brush?  The fisheries groups that have appeared before us have denied point blank any fraud.

Can the Minister justify any situation in which points would remain on a master's record even if the outcome of the prosecution found that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing?  Does he believe this is a fair and equitable way of treating an industry?  According to his opening statement, a level playing field must be established across the EU's fisheries.  This happens nowhere else in Europe, though, so saying that it is about a level playing field is a fallacy.  The industry is dealing with the outcome of Brexit, it is competing with other nations for which the same penalty point system does not apply, and it is now being told that it must tie up at ports to weigh catches in a manner that could affect quality, will be time consuming and could be costly for the fishers.

To make a general point, we have across the country fishers and so many others working in our fishing sector, which employs 16,000 overall and is worth &euro;1 billion to our economy.  It is such an important sector, has a really strong and sustainable future and can add value but also must deal with the undoubted impact, unfortunately, from Brexit, which will impact 15% of our national quota between now and 2026.  There is no doubt but that the revocation of the control plan impacts everyone in the sector, but without a doubt the vast majority of people working in the sector and the vast majority of fishers work really hard.  It is a really difficult lifestyle.  They go to great lengths to comply with the rules and regulations.  It is very important we say that and make that clear.  They deserve our recognition and our thanks for that.<\/p> <p>  Alongside that, however, we have a reality we have to deal with as a member state which concerns our control plan and the administrative inquiry the European Commission conducted.  There are issues that have to be addressed as a result of that.  The inquiry found that Ireland, as a member state, was not meeting its obligations arising from meeting the regulations through its control plan because the risk of non-compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy could not be minimised.  The assessment and the audit done by the Commission found there were issues which arose and which they came across which meant the Commission did not feel the control plan we had in place could ensure all the rules were being met.  The revocation of that control plan and the fact that factory weighing, which was much more practical for so many, has gone has been very challenging.  I know the SFPA is dealing, consulting and liaising daily with fishers and those who process fish on the impact of this.  It has led to tremendous difficulties.  We cannot, however, wish it away.  We have to deal with it.  It has had an impact, and as Minister I have to deal with the administrative inquiry and that legal process with the European Commission.  The control plan revocation is just one aspect of it which has had an immediate impact on our fishers.  There are other aspects of it which I am dealing with as part of that legal process.  I know that when the SFPA met with the committee last week, it outlined how it is engaging regarding the practical situation that now applies and how it will engage at an operational level with the European Commission move towards getting a control plan back in place and its intentions in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Browne's other point about the interconnectedness between the master's control point system and the courts system, if a master were to receive penalty points under the legislation and under the points system, he or she would have the option of an oral hearing with a determination panel.  He or she then has the option to appeal that further to an appeals officer and then the option, on a point of law, to appeal that to the High Court.  If the High Court, on a point of law, were to find in favour of the master, the penalty points would fall in that instance.  That is the points system.  It is an administrative system, not a criminal system.  It does not involve a criminal conviction.  What happens is that you get points on your master's licence.  If you accumulate a certain number of points - I think it is 90 in total - you can lose your master's licence.  If you get some points and within three years do not receive any more points, those points fall off your licence.  If you receive points and over the course of those three years get more points, you hold onto the ones you have got, the additional points you get accrue and the three-year clock resets.  If you do not get any more points within the next three years, those points then fall off your licence as well.  Ultimately, in the event of your getting the 90 points, you would lose your licence as a master.  This is not a criminal sanction but an administrative sanction whereby you are no longer able to operate as a master if you accrue that number of penalty points.  That is the impact of that.<\/p> <p>  It is similar to what would have happened regarding the licence holders within the licence holder penalty points system that was introduced by statutory instrument last year.  It is therefore not a criminal system but an administrative system.  There is an obligation on all EU member states to have such a system in place.  In fact, we are the only EU member state at this stage that does not have a penalty points system in place for masters' licences.  The obligation on member states to introduce one has been in place since 2012 and we are now the only state that does not have one.  On that point, and regarding a level playing field, other member states would certainly be able to make the point that without us having such a system in place, and because we are the only one that does not have it in place, there is not a level playing field.  Because we are the only member state that has not introduced it so far, the European Commission has taken infringement proceedings against us in the form of a reasoned opinion and has suspended our funding by up to &euro;26 million already, with the potential for that to increase to &euro;38 million.  The next step after that, if we do not meet our obligations to introduce a masters' penalty points system, would be for us to be taken to the Court of Justice by the European Commission for non-compliance.  That is the situation that pertains in that regard, and that is the reason we have to bring in a penalty points system, as is the obligation on other EU member states.  Ultimately, it is about ensuring that people comply with the regulations and, in particular, given that the vast majority do so, that there is a mechanism in place whereby those who do not comply can be penalised.  That was the principle and the theory behind its introduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021051300002#E00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I am sitting in for Senator Boyhan.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year the Minister designated seven of our ports in which foreign trawlers will be able to land their catch post Brexit, particularly UK-registered and Northern Ireland-registered vessels.

This report did not go back to the SFPA, it came back to the Irish Government.  Is it fair to say that it is actually up to the Minister to fund the SFPA and to put the control mechanism in place? The SFPA is already in receipt of millions of euros.  In the past two years it has received, I believe, in excess of &euro;24 million, and it has brought no actual prosecutions and has put us in jeopardy, as the Minister has said of &euro;38 million, and it may be a little bit more.  There is no prosecution and it has no mechanism for weighing fish.  Anything to do with the weighing of fish in the method that it is proposing is a food safety hazard, apart from anything else, and it is putting at risk all of the produce that is caught and has to be weighed on the quayside in the sun, where ice is dumped.  Most of the quayside&rsquo;s do not even have the ability to even provide ice.  Yet, this is what we are moving forward with, with funding of millions of euros coming to the SFPA.  The Minister is absolving himself of any responsibility to provide weighing mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, does not ask hauliers to weigh their trucks.  It is the enforcement agency and it must provide the weighing machines that are installed on the side of the roads.  If it has weigh pads, these are brought out with the authority and are calibrated every time they are moved.  Every time a movable weighing mechanism is moved, it must be calibrated, because the act of movement in itself uncalibrates it and it has to be calibrated every time it lands.  We have small piers in Wexford, in Duncannon, Kilmore Quay and Ballyhack.  None of these piers, and Kilmore Quay is the biggest of these, has a weighing mechanism for outside.  There is no way that this is going to be enforced in the same way upon foreign vessels as it will be on Irish fishing vessels. That is already the case here.  <\/p> <p>  There were 153 inspections carried out from information I received from a parliamentary question that I asked a number of weeks ago.  In the six-week period from mid-February to the end of March 2021, the SFPA carried out 153 inspections.  I would say that that is quite sizeable given that our fishing boats only come back to pier once a week and there were no serious infringements.  Yet, we have the EU telling us that we are not capable.  These were inspections carried out, by the way, before we saw the headline in the press that we were not capable of administering a control mechanism.

I will keep it tight because I see that other members have indicated also.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the derogation of the control plan, Deputy Mac Lochlainn has already outlined how the measures that are being used in processing plants at the moment are extremely accurate, traceable and transparent, and use state-of-the-art technology.  Deputy Kehoe alluded to the fact that the fishing sector and fishing community are up in arms.  There is a considerable level of anger because of a series of events, including the revocation of the control plan.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has explained that he cannot intervene to reintroduce a control plan or to override the decision of the Commission on the revocation of the control plan.  He has explained that the Bill does not allow him to do that.  What can he do?  Earlier this week representatives of the SFPA informed the committee that it would be a minimum of two months before it could introduce a new control plan.  Surely the Department has a role to intervene.  At the moment the piers do not have the infrastructure to weigh product.  The fishing sector has been left at a significant disadvantage and in an incredibly difficult position because that infrastructure is not in place.  Surely there is a role for the Department to step in and help them to provide this infrastructure in the interim.  Two months is a long time for a business.<\/p> <p>  The SFPA suggested that the reintroduction of the control plan would be for the white fish sector and the shellfish sector only.  What about the pelagic sector?  There is talk of the introduction of weighbridges at piers.  That will lead to considerable difficulty because if weighbridges are to be used and fish are being weighed on the back of a truck water needs to be taken into account.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn talked about the accuracy of in-plant weighing.  Using weighbridges for trucks where water, ice and other factors are involved, takes away from the accuracy that the Commission and the SFPA are supposed to be seeking.  Surely the Minister has a role if the industry is informing him that weighbridges and in-truck weighing on these weighbridges will not work, surely there is scope for maybe not intervention but to actually outline the thoughts and feelings of the sector.  <\/p> <p>  Given how we have got to this point where the control plan has been revoked, does the Minister believe he could commence a restructuring or overhaul of the SFPA?  As he has heard from Deputies here, as he has heard from the sector repeatedly and as he has heard in his town hall meetings last night, it is not working.  The relationships have broken down and there is a lack of engagement.  I ask the Minister to come back to me on the control plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021051300002#G02600","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution, his ongoing representations to me on behalf of fishers and the fishing community in County Cork and his work on their behalf.  As regards weighing and all those operational matters, legally I am precluded from getting into the middle of that.  Legally, that is the job of the committee, rather than my job as Minister.  The SFPA reports on those matters to, and engages on matters pertinent to it, with the appropriate committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, not with the Minister.  The law prevents me being involved in those matters and assigns the responsibility for engaging on them to the committee.  I know the committee met the SFPA earlier this week to discuss these matters in detail.  Were I to cross over into operational matters, I would be in breach of the Act.  The job of the SFPA is to apply EU regulations as a competent authority.  In terms of reporting, engaging and accountability, that is to Oireachtas committees.

The inshore fishing fleet, the white fish sector and the non-quota shellfish sector have obviously been massively impacted since the pandemic.  The markets have been obliterated and the price of fish has dropped significantly given the restrictions and the closure of restaurants.  There has been a drop in demand and that has caused significant issues for the sector.  During the first lockdown, a type of tie-up scheme was introduced for the industry but it did not go anywhere near far enough for the inshore fishing fleet.  In some cases, boats were only coming out with &euro;500.  It did not come near covering the losses that were suffered.  The fishers have been through an incredibly tough time and have had to endure significant losses of income.  When there has been a crisis in the farming sector, such as in the beef or dairy sectors, there has been a significant injection of grant aid to that sector.  I ask the Minister to please consider doing something for the inshore fleet and the men and women who rely so heavily on fishing for an income to feed their families and pay their mortgages.  Can consideration be given to some type of financial supports at a level that is much greater than what was introduced last summer after the first lockdown?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021051300002#H00400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

This is an industry that has been under pressure for many years.  It is a very difficult industry for anyone who is working in it.  It is dependent on weather and catches.  What worries me with regard to what is being proposed with weighing is that Irish boats will suffer most.  We will not be able to control the foreign boats.  We can say what we like but we were not able to do it with fishing and we will not be able to do it with weighing.  It will put further pressure on the industry here.  I have to be careful in terms of what I say because I am not within the precincts of the D&aacute;il.  There seems to be something not right in the industry.  Something needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for some time and the one thing I have never liked or wanted was for these agencies to be given this kind of power.  At the end of the day, the Minister and I have been elected to the Oireachtas and have responsibility to the people, not the State agencies.  When this trouble erupts, it will not be the SFPA that will deal with it; it will be the Minister and Oireachtas Members as politicians.  I know the committee met on Tuesday.  I wanted to attend but I could not do so because the computer I had in Dublin broke down.  I am now using my computer in my office here in Westport.  I wanted to speak at that meeting.  I hope we can bring the SFPA in again because giving power to faceless groups is not good.  The Minister is going to have to step in and try to do something for these fishermen.<\/p> <p>  As regards Europe, I know I will get a bit of stick for stating it has too much power and does not really care about our fishing industry.  It has sold the industry down the drain on many occasions.   The Minister should take a strong hand with Europe.  These fishermen are going through enough and I do not think there is any real reason this should be brought in.  It seems to be something that was created by people who think they do not have enough power and should have more power and should have total control over fishermen.  I do not like it or what is going on.<\/p> <p>  I am fully supportive of the fishermen.  There is great anger out there.  They are very upset and they are in a very difficult industry.  It has always been difficult.  We have great sympathy for them when people are tragically lost at sea and everybody sees how difficult the job and the life is.  Now is the time they need support and we should be there to give them that support.  If there is anything that can be done at European level, it should be done.

There is an awful lot of talk that the SFPA is to blame, that the task force is to blame, that the task force going to work on this, or that the SFPA will bring things forward.  Nobody is making decisions.  As I have said, it now looks as though officials knew this in December.  Nobody consulted anyone until April, which is shocking to say the least.  That was the time to start talking, but instead we are doing the talking now.  We will have another two months of talking and no answers for the man on the ground.  That is what I need as a public representative - an answer for the man on the ground.<\/p> <p>  Our session is two hours long and I am delighted the Minister is here before us.  In fairness, he has never shied away from us.  I am not personalising any of my criticism, but I have serious concerns about what will happen in the next two months.  The Minister has no solution.  He is pushing it over to the SFPA and to our committee.  We have ferocious power.  We have far more power than I ever knew we had.  We must bring the SFPA before us on a more frequent basis.  It seemed to know something in December that it did not relay to the industry, the public or public representative by 16 April.  Then we had a crisis and now we are now playing catch-up.<\/p> <p>  I am still asking the same question.  Can the Minister intervene this evening, or tomorrow morning, to try at least to find a short-term solution that everyone will agree to?  I think the system that was in place was quite adequate.  The powers that be could say that it is not above our heads and stand up to Europe a small bit because we need some strength on the ground in Ireland.  The Irish fishing industry is getting walked on left, right, and centre.  To me, this is a push.  There is so much apathy, unhappiness and mental health issues out there because of this carry-on that fishermen are going to say to themselves that they will get the hell out of this mess.  This is a nice handy way to push them towards decommissioning.  That is the feeling on the ground out there.  What is going to happen?  I asked the Minister that question yesterday.  What will happen to the fishermen who decommission their boats, the people who work on those boats and the rural communities in Castletownbere and elsewhere?  What will happen to those rural communities?  What is planned for them?  I would like an answer that goes beyond saying that the task force is coming forward with ideas.  I want to know the thoughts of the Minister in this regard, rather than those of the task force.  I want to know why four months elapsed.  Now we are at a crisis stage.  It looks like another two months will elapse before we get a decision.  What is going to happen with the fishing industry?  It is on its knees.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would answer me.  I do not want to hear what the SFPA thinks or what the task force thinks.  Who is the task force made up of?

I refer to those who work in it, those who live in it and those who were born into it in many cases as well.

Once the decision was communicated, the SFPA was in communication with the sector on that.  The authority has a challenging statutory role to carry out.

This has involved covering the entire coast piece by piece, meeting fishers, all those employed in the marine sector and all those with an interest or stake in coastal communities.  The intention is to talk directly, discuss these issues and hear about the views, challenges and opportunities and how we can make the most of our fishing sector and coastal resource in the years ahead.  Several committee members have joined in those town hall meetings.  Anyone and everyone who joins in and wants to make a contribution is being accommodated.  It has been a productive and constructive engagement.  Because of the pandemic I have not had the same opportunity to be at piers and harbours as I normally might as Minister, yet I am keen to listen, engage and be influenced by stakeholders in our marine sector and coastal communities as well as those who depend on the sector and wish to see it grow and be fully supported in the years ahead.  The town hall engagement is important in that regard.  I encourage the Deputy, if we have not reached his county yet, to advertise this process through his social media channels and encourage people to attend.  It has proved to be a useful engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021051300002#K00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I was having trouble with my computer earlier.

It is not a criminal system but one that deals with the potential for someone to have a licence and to be a master of a vessel and to run that vessel in compliance with the law and regulations.  In cases where those law or regulations are breached it is provided for penalty points to be applied to the master's licence in the same way as penalty points would be applied to a driver's licence on the road.  In cases where there are consistent, persistent and repetitive breaches of the regulations, a master subject to this legislation can accumulate penalty points.  Where a master accumulates up to 90 penalty points, the master will be debarred from being a master and from being on the European register of masters after that point.  Where there is one infringement but no more infringements for three years, then the penalty points that went with the infringement lapse.  If a master continues within a three-year period to accrue further penalty points, the master will build up to the stage where it will impact on the licence.

I am joined today by my colleagues, Professor Malcolm MacLachlan, clinical lead for people with disabilities, Ms Breda Crehan-Roche, chief officer, community healthcare organisation west, and Ms Angela O'Neill, national disability specialist, community operations.<br\/><br\/>PDS is a significant programme of reform that will change the way we deliver services and supports for children with complex needs.  Children&rsquo;s disability services in Ireland developed in an<i>ad hoc <\/i>manner, whereby some children received an excellent service and others received none.  The provision of services is currently inequitable and varies depending on a child&rsquo;s disability, their age, where they go to school or where they live.  The reform of services in line with the PDS programme is an integral part of Sl&aacute;intecare health reforms and is a key policy commitment in the programme for Government.<br\/><br\/>In essence, PDS will provide a clear pathway and fairer access to services for all children with a disability based on their needs, make the best use of and fairly distribute available resources for the benefit of all children and their families and ensure effective clinical teams are working in partnership with families and with education staff to support children with a disability to reach their full potential.<br\/><br\/>Further, PDS aligns with two clear objectives of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, in that it seeks to provide the majority of care at or as close to home as possible and create an integrated system of care with healthcare professionals working closely together.  Children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, have been established to provide services and supports for all children with complex needs within a defined geographical area.  CDNTs are teams of health and social care professionals, and can include occupational therapy, psychology, nursing, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, social work and others.  The teams work closely together in a family-centred model, focusing on the child&rsquo;s and family&rsquo;s own priorities.  Once all teams are in place, every child with complex needs will have access to a team, regardless of the nature of his or her disability, where he or she lives or the school he or she attends.<br\/><br\/>Children and their families will have access to the full range of services and supports of the CDNT, according to their individual needs.  This includes universal, targeted and specialist supports, such as parent programmes, individual therapeutic intervention and access to specialist consultation and assessment, when needed.  Interdisciplinary supports for children with complex disability needs will be provided as far as possible in the child&rsquo;s natural environments - their home, school and community.<\/p><p>There are 136 special schools across the country, of which 33 have an on-site health-funded service provision, which equates to approximately 85 whole-time equivalent staff working in the area, at an approximate cost in excess of &euro;6 million.  The children attending these 33 schools represent approximately 6% of children with complex needs in the State.  The level of service available in these schools varies widely.  Many children with equally complex needs attend mainstream schools or special schools that do not have dedicated on-site services.<\/p><p> This committee specifically referred to occupational therapy services.  Some 15 special schools have an on-site occupational therapy service.  The level of service available varies from one occupational therapist to 30 pupils to one occupational therapist to 460 pupils.  This is a huge variation.  There are approximately 320 occupational therapists working in children&rsquo;s disability services.  The average ratio of occupational therapists to children with disabilities is 1:126.  It should be noted that in the existing model, on-site services, where they exist, generally provide a unidisciplinary model of service.  Ten special schools deliver only speech and language therapy with ratios varying from one speech and language therapist to 125 pupils to one speech and language therapist to 425 pupils.  The average ratio of speech and language therapists to children with disabilities in the wider community is 1:115.  There is widespread inequity in both the distribution of and access to specialist health and social care supports for children with complex disability needs.<\/p><p> The clear aim of the progressing disability services model is to address these inequities so that children access services based on their needs.  Children's disability network teams have already been established in many parts of the country and the remaining children's disability network teams will be established by the end of quarter 2 of this year.  These interdisciplinary teams work with children in schools, including special schools, and provide a service for all children with complex needs in their geographical area.  They deliver a child and family-centred model of support, working with children, their families and within school settings as required.<\/p><p> Supporting staff to be members of children's disability network teams ensures that they can benefit from appropriate management and clinical governance support.  This will allow the health services to ensure that staff have the necessary skills and competencies to meet the needs of children with disabilities, and that they can benefit from interdisciplinary working and complementary insights from other professions, to which they will often not have had access previously.<\/p><p> Working closely with government, the HSE has been reviewing the services in special schools to ensure that these schools fully benefit from the enhanced provision afforded by children's disability network teams.  The HSE confirms that existing supports provided to the small number of special schools will remain in place, delivered in line with the progressing disability services policy and via the children's disability network teams.  The HSE and our section 38 and 39 lead agency partners are mindful to reassure parents with children attending special schools of our commitment to build the capacity of these network teams to give greater levels of interdisciplinary supports.<\/p><p> In summary, the Minister and the HSE remain committed to the implementation of the progressing disability services model and are anxious to ensure that children in special schools as well as children with complex needs in special classes or mainstream education can access the full range of services provided by children's disability network teams as appropriate.  Our services are for all children with disabilities regardless of their type of disability, their location or the type of school they attend.  We are happy to address any questions the committee may wish to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Morgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I confirm that I am in Leinster House.  As today's first speaker, I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their submission and time.  The proposed progressing disability services programme is positive in that services will no longer be accessed through separate organisations and access will be based on children's needs as opposed to their diagnoses.  This has been a recurring issue in my constituency of County Clare.  A number of distressed parents have been in contact with my office about a lack of access to services as they have not yet received an assessment of need for their children, which has caused great difficulties for children and families.<\/p> <p>  I am eager for more definitive information about the progressing disability services programme's roll-out.  The programme was established in 2010.  We know from the submission that not all of the required children's disability network teams have been established.  That concerns me.  Is there a timeline for when all children's disability network teams will be configured and in place?  I can see how families and school settings may be nervous about the implementation of this programme as seems there was no foresight in evidence recently.  We saw plans to remove on-site services, which would impact negatively on these children.  For this reason, there is not much confidence among parents.  Schools will need significant assurances from the HSE that the level of on-site services for special schools will not be reduced.  How does the HSE plan to manage the progressing disability services programme?  Will on-site services stay in place during a transition period?  What is the long-term goal?  How are schools with no on-site services being assessed with regard to their service needs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#B00200","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I can respond to the majority of the questions.  I will also include my colleague, Ms O'Neill, about the assessment of need.  I welcome what the Deputy said and the positive welcome for progressing disability services.  We and our lead agency partners believe that it is the right thing to do.  It has been in development and implementation for more than ten years.  To answer the direct question about timelines, we will have implemented all 91 networks by the end of quarter 2.  Over 40 are now in place and all are to be in place by the end of quarter 2.<\/p> <p>  We agree with the Deputy about providing reassurance for schools.  We are concerned about making sure that parents, principals and education staff can be assured.  It is critical that we work with them in a co-operative and collaborative manner.  I gave a commitment in my opening statement that existing on-site arrangements for resources will remain in place.<\/p> <p>  Regarding how networks will work with schools more generally, we have a national access policy.  That facilitates the education sector, parents and the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, which are responsible, with the lead agencies, for agreeing how best to deliver the services.  It is important to say that each of the 91 networks has a network manager, all of whom are clinicians by profession.  They are leading these interdisciplinary teams and one of their key functions is to ensure that these arrangements are clearly articulated to parents and teaching staff.  We have local structures for implementation which include staff, because the input of staff as well as parents is critical to successful implementation.  We cannot overemphasise the communications issue because one cannot communicate enough on this.  We accept that people are worried and we will do our best to ensure that we address those concerns.<\/p> <p>  The assessment of need is important.

It is not the only way.  Our preference is for children to access services directly through the children's disability network teams, which is what many children and families do.  The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant waiting lists for the assessment of need process and that there was significant investment late last year to clear those backlogs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, secured &euro;7.8 million to eliminate those backlogs.  At the end of June last year, we had 6,500 overdue assessments of need.  That number has been reduced and at the end of April, we had just over 1,400 overdue assessments of need.  The Deputy referred specifically to Clare.  The mid-west area is one where the backlog is almost eliminated.  There are approximately 60 assessments of need outstanding, all of which are in process.  Significant progress has been made on assessments of need in recent months.<\/p> <p>  Our priority is to ensure that children are able to access timely assessments and interventions through the children's disability network teams and that, rather than seeing children based on their position on a waiting list, we should see them based on their needs.

In that report it is clear to us that there is a need for dedicated funding streams to build the capacity of those networks.  We are not shy in saying that.  We are happy that we got an additional &euro;100 million from the Vote for this year and also with the 100 posts we are getting this year.

First, I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, with regard to the occupational therapists.  There was a pause in that area and it was withdrawn.  This service is very important so I commend her on that.  Families and children with special educational needs suffered most during the pandemic.  The rug was pulled from under them time and again.  I met families who wondered what else would happen to them or what else they would have to fight for.  Unnecessary stress and anxiety were put on these families and the children really lost out.  Last month, the Ombudsman for Children said: &quot;Children with disabilities are not seen - they are overlooked in laws, policies and programmes.  Children with disabilities are not heard - they are not actively or effectively involved in consultations.&quot;  I would like a response to that.  He continued:<\/p> <blockquote> \tChildren with disabilities are not counted - they are relatively invisible in data.  Looking at the delays and the barriers facing children with disabilities, it is clear that they are always at a huge disadvantage. ... It is high time that children with disabilities and their families stop having to battle to overcome barriers.  Our laws and policies must serve all of our children and allow them all to access the best education possible. <\/blockquote> <p>As has been said, the provision of services is currently unfair and varies depending on a child's disability, age, where the child goes to school or where the child lives.  I welcome that we all appear to agree that this has to change urgently.  Families in Carlow should be able to access the same support as families in Donegal.<\/p><p>On the issue of staffing, Dr. Morgan spoke about funding.  When we discuss funding it is important that we get the breakdown of the funding in all the areas.  My area is community healthcare organisation, CHO 5.  How many professionals have left the system?  Are we struggling with recruitment?  What steps are being taken to recruit - the witness spoke about recruitment - and also to retain staff in this area?  We need more clarification on that because we must do all we can to make life easier for these families and children.<\/p><p>This brings me to my next point, which is full inclusion.  All students in New Brunswick in Canada are educated together in their local schools.  Every child, able and disabled, students with complex needs, talented students, thriving students and disadvantaged students all study together.  They are all learning together, living the same experience with their own tailored experience.  In 2019, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, spoke about this idea to fully include all students.  It suggested examining this model.  Since that suggestion in late 2019, we have had the coronavirus and we have lost ground, but is this a model that we will consider piloting?  Is there any hope we might examine such a pilot scheme?  It is important that we work with everyone.  The witness spoke about the 91 networks, which are very welcome.  We all have to work together, but it is also important that we see the results.  Families and children have been so affected by this, so perhaps the witnesses can respond to my points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#C00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":386,"content":"<p>The Deputy's points are very well made.  I will address each of them and I will ask my colleague, Professor MacLachlan, to respond because it is relevant to some of the models of support on which he can speak.<\/p> <p>  The piece in terms of the Canadian model and the inclusion model is absolutely fundamental and is something we all should support from the point of view that, as I understand it, we are trying to implement a policy of mainstreaming where children with disabilities would be included fully in mainstream education settings.  We must do all we can to support those children and their families to make that real.  That is a challenge in the context of how we move from special education settings because there are conflicts in people's views on this as to whether it should be purely mainstream as distinct from a special education setting and as distinct from the mainstream setting with supports as required, but in the policy it is important that we drive towards that.  I am confident that our networks, when fully resourced and bedded down and working well, can complement that in a real way by working conjointly with education partners.  There is a difference of approach from the point of view that therapies provided in classroom settings are to do with educational attainment.  What might be a distinction from the health and social care point of view is working with children and families on specific complex needs, whether it is behavioural supports, speech and language and so forth.  The point is to put the child at the centre of the process with the family and let us work together to see what is best in their interest.<\/p> <p>  I will provide the Deputy with a report on staffing.  I will mention a couple of matters.  In response to the last Deputy, I referred to the additional 100 posts from last year and another 100 posts for this year.  That is not enough; we need more.  Again, I referred to the fact that, for us, the capacity review report is the basis on which we can build on these networks.  There are a few other items from a resource point of view that are important to note.  The Deputy mentioned the Minister of State who, I must say, has been strident and very energetic in getting behind us on making change.  She is doing real work in respect of bringing investment.  There is an additional &euro;100 million in this year's budget.  Our budget on disability this year is &euro;2.2 billion.  It is a specialist service.  Again, the capacity review report identifies that we need more.  There is no doubt about that.<\/p> <p>  The other piece I wish to mention relates to the pandemic.  The Deputy is correct that we have been going through unprecedented times.  Some children and families, quite a lot, have been much more impacted than others for a variety of different reasons.  It is important to say that.  We have been trying to do things differently, and Professor MacLachlan might refer to this, which we think will help in terms of changing how we do our practice on remote interventions and how we can work with people safely.  This relates to another area the Deputy mentioned, staff leaving the disability services.  From our experience, we feel there is a great deal of support from staff to work in these networks.  It has been clear to us that staff benefit more when they are in an interdisciplinary team.  We have been concerned that some staff have been working in silos - I know it is a dreadful term - and almost in isolation in school settings without the benefit of their peers working with them, if that makes sense.  From a welfare point of view, that is not good.  It is not good either from a clinical governance perspective.  It means that the clinician is working in isolation and does not have the benefit of interventions from other disciplines working conjointly with him or her, along with education colleagues.<\/p> <p>  Professor MacLachlan might wish to address some of the points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal Morgan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  I fully agree that the New Brunswick model she described is very attractive.  It is also consistent with the development of the children's disability network teams.  One of the ideas behind those teams is to deliver on the ethos of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, which stresses delivering services to people in their community so that children with disability can live fully as members of their community and interact with other children like them.  The introduction of the CDNTs is a key element of that.  Clearly, we are talking from the health service side, and there is also an education side.  From the health service perspective, the New Brunswick model would be entirely consistent with what we are interested in doing.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned some concerns about consultation.  In the last year the HSE established the new national clinical programme for people with disabilities.  That programme's function is clinical design - designing how services should be delivered.  This programme is different in a number of ways from other clinical programmes in the HSE.<\/p><p>With regard to consultation, for instance, we have three service users, four service providers and several different professions.  We have the confidential recipient and our chair is a person with a disability and is independent of the HSE.  We have designed the system like this very deliberately to have good consultation and representation of other voices.  Our clinical design is very much grounded on identifying the needs of people with disabilities.  In the future, members will see a significant level of interaction and consultation with people with disabilities.  That has been going on for several years so it is a question of it being built on and formalised by the clinical programme.  The symbolism of formalising it is really important.<\/p><p> Dr. Morgan referred to some work that the National Clinical Programme for People with Disability has been doing on remote working during Covid.  I absolutely agree with the comment that Covid has really hit children, their families and their carers incredibly hard.  We have clinicians who were not very familiar with remote working before Covid.  When we surveyed staff, we discovered that of the 88 respondents who were clinicians working on the front line, fewer than one third had experience of doing remote work.  Now, at this point in the Covid pandemic, all but two are working remotely.  Remote working is not in any way a substitute for person-to-person interaction but it does have some benefits in that it has allowed us to reach out to a broader range of people.  It has allowed parents to attend sessions that they were not able to attend before, for instance.  In future, we want to take on board some of the lessons and benefits.  These relate very much to inclusion value and the participation of people with a disability and their supporters.  The model of care we are trying to promote involves putting children and families first and seeking to serve them in the community rather than in a specific location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I confirm I am in Leinster House.  I warmly welcome the witnesses from the HSE who have addressed the meeting and thank them for their submission.  Deputy Wynne referred to the fact that the progressing disability services model was established in 2010.  How come it has taken so long to roll it out?  Was it a funding issue?  What were the issues arising?  It was indicated that 31 of 91 intended children's disability network teams have been established and that all of them will be established by the end of quarter 2, which is welcome.  How come it has taken so long?<\/p> <p>  After housing, the issue I am most contacted about is that of waiting lists associated with assessments of need or accessing therapies, supports and interventions for children with a disability.  While I welcome the progressing disability services model on paper and believe it looks brilliant, I note that many parents are very sceptical as to whether it will improve circumstances.  I really hope it does.  Some parents have told me waiting periods for some Enable Ireland and HSE services can run into years.  How is this backlog going to be addressed?  Have extra staff been recruited?  Maybe the witnesses will confirm whether some therapists have been diverted to carrying out assessments and that the waiting list for interventions has grown longer as a result.  Regardless of whether this is true and irrespective of the answer I am given, the waiting list for interventions is long.  How will this be addressed?<\/p> <p>  Many parents tell me that even if their children receive supports, they receive very little.  They might have a speech and language therapy session only once every few months, or a couple per year.  Will the frequency of interventions increase?  Will a behavioural analyst be part of the team for children with autism, especially if they are non-verbal?  There are individuals with qualifications in analysing behaviour and working with children with autism.  Are they part of the team?<\/p> <p>  Speech and language therapy comes up a lot, especially regarding children with Down's syndrome.  Many parents say to me that their children really need intervention in this regard before they go to school but that it is often two or three years into school before they have access to any such support.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the witnesses said assistive supports for special schools are going to remain.  I welcome that.  It is excellent.  Will there be a link with schools anyway?  Will there be a strong link between the team and the school, be it a special school, a unit within a school or a mainstream school?  Will there be a link with CAMHS?  How does the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, fit into it?  Will it be part of the team or will the service still be based within the school?<\/p> <p>  Parents often say to me that the biggest issue is when their child, on reaching the age of 18, is transitioning from children's services to adult services.

I will address her really good queries.  I will include my colleague, Ms Breda Crehan-Roche, because she specifically mentioned the ASD element of the challenge in the system.  On the matter of why it has taken so long, the development of the progressing disability services policy, based on what we were talking about earlier, has been about consulting and bringing together children and staff to understand what is needed, examine models in other jurisdictions and agree on how best to provide child- and family-centred supports.  It took time to get people to coalesce around what would be the best model for Ireland.  We often look to models overseas but we need to think about how they work in an Irish context so we can contextualise them.  We placed very heavy emphasis on trying the initiative out.  Several regions piloted it.  The mid-west and Kerry, in particular, went through a reconfiguration process.  We wanted to see how the initiative worked and to refine it as we were going along.  The significant changes we have been making involved multiple organisations and agencies, including the HSE, that were delivering supports in their own way, not a joined-up way.  Bringing together all the entities, including the State, to agree on whether the system could be organised to make it simpler for the child and family to access one team rather than multiple organisations required a significant level of negotiation and mediation with the trade unions and other organisations on the question of how, if the child and family were to be put up front, the service could be delivered in a manner that was seamless for the children.  I am delighted that we have done that.  It is not perfect.  I am not saying it is all rosy in the garden; it is not at all but we are absolutely on track to have the 91 networks in place by the end of quarter 2.  The Deputy should note that there are over 40 in place, as distinct from 31.  We will clarify where they are so she will have sight of them for herself.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Ms O'Neill to address the waiting lists initiative.  The Deputy should keep in mind that an additional resource of 100 posts was given to us last year.  There are another 100 posts for this year.  It is not enough so we will be relying on the capacity review report to build the competency of the teams, as in having more staff come in.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the connectivity between CAMHS, primary care services, education services, NEPS and so on.  I will provide the committee with a copy of our national access policy, which I referred to before.  The policy helps to determine how we assess children and stream them into the right service.  That includes how children can access CAMHS because that is a key concern for us, particularly regarding behavioural supports.<\/p><p>The Deputy rightly identified this matter as being a significant concern for families.  Behavioural management supports will be a key part of what the networks will do.  Children will have access to psychology services.<\/p><p> ASD is a significant concern for us.  We have an improvement programme that includes parents as well as people with autism.  It will determine how we will develop more and better supports.  It will align and dovetail well with the work being done by Ms Crehan-Roche, the chair of the initiative and the chief officer in the west.  She might talk us through what that initiative is about.<\/p><p> There is an old phrase: \"Culture eats strategy for breakfast.\"  We can pour in all the resources we want, but if there is not a fundamental change in how clinicians work, there are no standardised norms in how we perform interventions and our system is one of assessments only, then we create a waiting list for assessment and then another for intervention.  That has to stop.  We must move to a scenario where children are on an intervention pathway from the get-go.  Assessment is ongoing.  Professor MacLachlan has a great deal to say about this matter because he will be leading an initiative on how we might work with clinicians on doing things differently with children and families.<\/p><p> To summarise, there are two elements: the autism programme board and capacity building among clinicians.  Ms O'Neill might discuss the assessment of need element.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal Morgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

It will cover decision-making and entail everyone looking at the needs of children and their families and how to work together to best meet those needs.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the autistic community, we have a service improvement board, which I chair.  It comprises people with lived experience, parents, other family members, various clinicians and many other stakeholders from fields such as primary care, mental health and disability, as required.  The board is examining matters such as awareness.  It is important we educate people and make them aware of what autism is.  People with a lived experience have a crucial part to play in that respect.  We are also examining pathways for diagnosis and assessment.  Recently, the Minister announced a knowledge hub and phone line.  We are working closely with various colleagues in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the progressing disability services, PDS, programme.  Behavioural support is very much a part of that.

She hit the nail on the head in terms of the relationship between intervention and assessment.  Historically, this has been a difficulty because we have not had a standard way of performing assessments.  The way one clinician in one part of Ireland does an assessment might be entirely different from the way another clinician in another part would do it.  This has led to clinicians being conservative and spending a great deal of time doing assessments.  Sometimes, they have had concerns there might be litigation against them if the assessment is not done in an appropriate way.  Some of the work that has been ongoing in this regard for a number of years has been to introduce a standard operating procedure that indicates the appropriate way clinicians should perform assessments.  It gives them guidance and helps to streamline what they are doing.  It also gives them protection so that they feel safer about doing shorter assessments.  Since they can do shorter assessments, more clinical time is available to perform the intervention.<\/p> <p>  Long waiting lists for assessment and even longer waiting lists for intervention were building up.  That was an unsatisfactory way to approach this issue.  As such, we have various initiatives under way to encourage clinicians to see initial assessment not as a one-off activity, but as something that is continuous and is informed by the consequences of the interventions and supports they offer someone.<\/p> <p>  As the committee has been hearing, the money the Minister has made available has made a significant difference in reducing the waiting lists.  We do not want intervention waiting lists building up.  Often, targeted interventions can be simple and cost efficient and produce a significant difference.  Until recently, however, we were blocked from being able to do those because so much emphasis was placed on assessments.<\/p> <p>  Some of the work we are doing has to do with trying to build confidence and evidence-based models of service.  As my colleague, Ms Crehan-Roche, stated, the models are informed by the views of service users.  There is a great deal of activity under way on the autism model of service that we are in the process of developing.  For instance, it has representation from CAMHS.  We will also consult NEPS.<\/p> <p>  We are aware of the considerable sensitivities around transitioning.  Transitioning is a problem created by our services.  A person's life is a continuum, but the way in which we orchestrate our services causes problems for transitioning.  We are aware of those and addressing them in a number of different models of service we are developing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.  I have a couple of technical questions.  Will moving to a direct provision of services entail HSE direct delivery or will it still involve section 38 and 39 organisations?  Recruitment for 100 additional posts following a capacity review report was mentioned.  Additional resources, including personnel, in this area would be welcome.  I was concerned by the initial presentation's emphasis on the amount of money being spent on school supports.  If we get into a dynamic of money being taken from here and put there instead of recognising this as an area that needs different resources, it will be dangerous.  It is important we signal that additional resources are needed.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the capacity review, one of the main issues is not just that we do not have the 91 teams in place but also that we do not know what is required for assessments of need on a full scale.  The assessment of needs mechanism does not include diagnosis, proper intervention or planning.  People are waiting for a period.  Is it not the case we not only need to get the 91 teams in place but we also need to clear the backlog, possibly through those teams, of people waiting in the limbo between having an initial assessment and getting a plan and, in some cases, diagnosis before we know the capacity needs of the 91 teams?<\/p><p>That is really important because it points to why we cannot remove supports that are currently there when not only is the new system not in place but we do not yet know what the pressures and capacity needs on it will be.<\/p><p> On that, I note and welcome the statement from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that there will be a pause on the removal of supports from special schools.  That is appropriate.  This year, we saw how a few months can have an impact in terms of regression.  We need to avoid gaps in the system which children carry in their development.  It is good that we have places where there is a ratio of 1:30 because it sets a bar towards which we should aim and there should be no backward steps.<\/p><p> Is there still a danger that speech therapy and other services may be removed from non-special, mainstream schools which have made an effort to put additional supports in place through the school system for those members of the school community who need such supports?  That is a concern I have because the pausing message we have heard is only on special schools but there are those other schools.  I would appreciate a comment on what we mean when we talk about the UNCRPD and the social model.  The social model is not simply about where the intervention takes place - it moves it from solely being about the individual and their access to supports to a responsibility on society to redesign and change itself.  Mainstream schools have tried to take a lead in bringing supports within their school system to show that those who might need additional supports, such as speech therapy, are part of a school community.  Is that not a model we should be pushing so that our schools are responding to UNCRPD rather than simply seeing that the individual can access it another way?  <\/p><p> I have a practical question which the witnesses might be able to answer, given that they have had these pilots.  I am concerned about some of the assumptions and the possibility that the administrative burden being placed on families who have a child with a disability could increase under this model.  Will these new centres be open during working hours only?  Will they be open at weekends?  Will they be accessible by public transport?  Is there an assumption that a full-time parent is free and available to advocate for their child, get them into the systems, deal with the administration and arrange appointments and gaps from schools?  Sometimes there is a huge assumption that families can undertake a massive administrative piece, but not all families will have the capacity, and in some cases the willingness, to do this.  With school interventions, at least, children may be advocated for in accessing supports through that setting also.  What measures are in place in this regard?  I worry that children will fall through the gaps between existing supports.  I would rather that we doubled up on supports rather than risking those kinds of gaps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#E00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I will share a response with Ms O'Neill on the evidence available to us which we feel is worth sharing.  I absolutely agree with the Senator on the administrative burdens on children.  Professor MacLachlan referred to this earlier.  We need to make the service simple for people to access.  If one looks at our national access policy, and I mentioned this in my opening statement, there is capacity and flexibility around where children can be met.  We want to make this choice-based with families making decisions.  In other words, it may be appropriate for some families to meet with teams in the home.  It may be appropriate in primary care settings or equally in mainstream and special school settings as well.  At a national level, we do not want to be absolutely deterministic about this because we feel that regional community health organisations should be able to sit down with the providers and families to see how best we can provide it in a flexible way with the resources we have.  I have no difficulty with the Senator's point of principle.  I think she is spot on.<\/p> <p>  On the Minister of State's intervention on the pause, I mentioned in my opening statement that as far we are concerned the resource that is in the existing settings will not be removed.  I will clarify a few points on that.  The Senator is correct in saying that we should not be using the &euro;6 million investment as a type of leveraging, pitting one setting against another.  The point I was trying to make in my statement was to draw attention to the inequity in the system.  I said in previous inputs that we believe more investment is needed.  It should be done in a way which brings education, families and health services together to meet needs, rather than an approach of \"how does your problem fit our solution?\" because that just does not work.  The UNCRPD is a fundamental driver of how that should change.  To be fair to the Minister of State, her concern has always been that there should be no diminution of the existing resource in the existing settings.  Our key concern is around equity - we need to make sure we can provide an equitable distribution of the service and build on that with additional resources because there is no doubt that more resources are needed.  I made the point in my opening statement that this is not going to change.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right about mainstream school settings.  We have mapped all of the speech and language therapy, SLT, supports going into mainstream settings.  They are primarily delivered through primary care.  Ms Crehan-Roche might speak to this from the perspective of the chief officers in the nine regions, who have agreed that this will remain in place.  We understand that it is fundamental for SLT professionals to work jointly with the teaching profession around language acquisition and curriculum attainment.

There was one issue in particular she raised which I want to clarify, which relates to diagnoses and problems accessing diagnoses, etc.  It is important from the point of view of the national clinical programme for people with disabilities to emphasis that our programme is orientated towards the implementation of the CRPD, and, therefore, we tend not to use medical terminology when describing people with disabilities.  We talk about classifying or identifying people with disabilities rather than diagnosing them.<\/p> <p>  In addition, rather than this being just a semantic point, there is a more important element to this.  Let us consider the condition of a child with autism.  As members know, autism is now described as a spectrum disorder.  To say that someone has autism does not actually tell us about what his or her needs are.  There is significant heterogeneity among people's experience of autism.  Not only is there a difficulty in saying when autistic experience starts and stops, in terms of a spectrum, but there is also a range involved.  Two people could have autism and have completely different experiences.  That is why there is such an emphasis on needs-led intervention.  It is a great point because many clinicians overvalue the idea of a diagnosis because there is safety in diagnosis.  There has been a tradition of seeing that as an end point of a process.  That was what I was describing earlier.  In the assessment and identification of people's needs there should never be an end point; it is a continuing process.  In the identification of needs, looking at transitions across the life course, etc., should be an on going challenge for us.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised another point but on my screen her image froze at the key point of her last question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I talked about the importance of mainstream and other schools having spaces that are inclusive and, in terms of awareness, the importance of being able to see that part of a school community includes members who are getting additional supports in the school setting.

It is not simply siloed access for those individuals who need it; it is about changing all of our systems and the importance of developing that in parallel with more specified services.  The issue in that regard was not really the word \"diagnosis\".  In the needs assessment, in terms of capacity and staffing issues, it is more about the fact that because there is a backlog, the level of need is not being fully assessed so the capacity and requirements of these teams might need to increase.

Regarding the assessment of needs, the children's committee oversees some of disability matters as well and we had the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in recently, which was great.  I want to highlight to the witnesses that there was some discrepancy between what she said and the standard operating procedure, SOP, for the assessment of needs.  The SOP specifies that the assessments shall take from one to one and a half hours.  The Minister of State clearly stated that was not the case.  There is probably a need to update the SOP in relation to assessment needs.  Any comments on that are welcome.<\/p> <p>  With regard to speech and language therapy in schools, we were talking about the different ratios ranging from 100 to 400 depending on the area one is in.  I do not mean to only talk about Cork and west Cork, but I do not know of any other area that is in the same situation.  I have raised this issue at this committee and at the children's committee.  There is no access to speech and language therapy in west Cork so people have to travel.  It takes people on Mizen Head or the Beara Peninsula in excess of two hours to get to Cork city for 30 minutes of essential therapy.  Many of the people who have been in touch with my office have said that sometimes the people who are accessing the service cannot spend that long in an enclosed space in a car.  That journey is up to three hours each way.  Perhaps that is the case in other areas in the country but I am not aware of that and I have not heard it mentioned.  I know it sounds ridiculous but perhaps west Cork should get special treatment.  I think it might be in a special situation which I wanted to bring to the witnesses' attention.

That was causing huge problems for us in supporting children and families to access services and in being able to meet our legislative obligations under the Disability Act.  That is why we introduced our standard operating procedure, SOP.  Members familiar with the procedure will know it is a fairly thick document.  It contains the standard operating procedure, which is the gospel, and a number of appendices.  The SOP defines an assessment of need as a preliminary team assessment.  Instead of the comprehensive assessment, it is an assessment that will determine whether or not a child meets the definition of disability in the Act and identify the child's needs as required by the Act.  One of the appendices is a guidance for assessors.  That guidance for clinicians gives a suggested timeframe for assessment and suggests the types of assessment tools they may use.  It is, however, guidance, and it is up to each clinician to determine, based on his or her clinical expertise, what the individual child needs.  It would be impossible for us to define what every child coming in will need in terms of the length of time and the assessment tools to be used because it varies based on their age, their presenting needs and so on.  It is therefore a very general guidance and it is for each clinician to determine himself or herself what format that preliminary team assessment will take.  What we are saying very clearly is that it is a preliminary screening.  It is a once-off assessment rather than the 100-plus hours that were being devoted in some areas and the system getting totally clogged up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":418,"content":"<p>That makes complete sense.

I was in the D&aacute;il and am just coming in to join the meeting now.  I have been listening to the debate for the past few minutes.  I have read Dr. Morgan's opening remarks as well.  The biggest issue with disabilities and children is that not every child is the same and the culture of putting children into specific categories does not seem to work because what can help one child may not constitute the measures that will be helpful for another child, and this creates a difficulty for parents.<\/p> <p>  The other big issue I come across a lot is that people talk about early intervention, early intervention, early intervention.  Then there is follow-on from when children are, say, six years of age.  They go from the early intervention into another service and there seems to be a gap in the service - perhaps not a gap, but the stepping stones are not there.  It seems that when they are finished with that, it is a case of \"somebody else will deal with you after this\".  That happens again at age 18 or whatever.  The difficulty is that we probably do not have the resources to provide a tailor-made service for each individual child.  In the ideal world, what more do the witnesses need to make sure we do things right for all the children?  The submission states that PDS will do certain things.  However, when it states \"will do it\", how can we see the tangible results coming through such that there are more therapists and clinicians on the ground in primary care centres dealing with these children who need the help?  One of the greatest traumas is for parents to find out there is something wrong with their child, whether autism or whatever else, and a lot of stuff goes over their heads for a while.  Then there is denial on the part of parents for a while, which I myself have seen, because this is their nightmare.  What is the witnesses wish list to make the service better and to have more resources?  What are their big asks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#H00400","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Crehan-Roche, who is the chief officer of community healthcare west, to come in on this as well.  As for the big asks, first I wish to acknowledge the fact that we have had record investment, and I am not just saying that.  We have had record investment this year of an additional &euro;100 million, which has brought our overall budget to &euro;2.2 billion this year.  That is very significant.  In the context of children and their needs, I mentioned previously that we had an additional 100 posts last year and another 100 this year.  I am full sure the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is keenly aware of the need for new resources and I think is banging down a lot of doors to bring them in.  I emphasised what is called the capacity review report.  It is a programme for Government commitment.  In that report there is significant emphasis on year-on-year investment, which has been costed.  That includes year-on-year investment in new therapies coming into these networks.  The investment has been costed.<\/p> <p>  Second, the Deputy mentioned quite rightly the experience of families of going from the nought-to-six early intervention team, then heading off to another team.  The networks are seeking to collapse all those teams into one team in order that early intervention happens from the get-go and, as Professor MacLachlan said, that we journey with the child and the family through the life cycle, including when children become adults.  That is the policy we are trying to implement.  The important thing to refer to in that regard is this: we could pour significant amounts of new resources into this but unless in parallel we have change in how we actually work with families, it could be to ill effect from the point of view of what Professor MacLachlan said earlier.  We want to move to a scenario in which interventions happen first such that we do not build up lists of assessments followed by another waiting list for interventions.  Intervention starts straight away and keeps going.  The change of practice and having standards and norms as to how we do intervention, with the child and the family being at the centre of the process, are what we are trying to work at through this progressing disability services policy.<\/p> <p>  It would be useful if the chief officer gave some practical outline to the Deputy as to how the policy has been working in community healthcare west as an example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal Morgan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  It is vital that the early intervention school-age, nought-to-six and six-to-18, teams are one streamlined service.  If we can have the teams colocating, even better.  It is important when we move from a young child to adolescence to a young adult that there is proper planning and that it dovetails in order that people work together and with the family on what that child will require.  In the west, for example, which the Deputy knows very well, we have nine network teams and we will have all nine absolutely implemented and in place by the end of this quarter, that is, the end of June.  We are working with the HSE and the likes of the Brothers of Charity, Ability West, special schools and special classes, Western Care Association and Enable Ireland.  We are pooling our resources in order that there are therapists working together and getting advice from their colleagues, not working in silos on their own.  I am thinking of schools like &Aacute;balta, which the Deputy will know well.  &Aacute;balta has 0.2 of a speech and language therapist, which is one day a week, and 0.2 of an occupational therapist, OT, and they will be left in place.  They will have access in the progressing disability services and children's network teams, which will be led by the Brothers of Charity, to more than 26 whole-time equivalents.  Those are people such as speech and language therapists, OTs, behavioural specialists and physios, again depending on what the child needs.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to when a parent finds out his or her child has different needs.  Informing families is certainly very important.  The committee will be aware that work was carried out by the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, funded by the HSE, in terms of how best to inform families.  The Deputy is quite right that people may find it difficult and that it can take time.  We are on that journey with them because this is about the child and the family.  Their interests are paramount and first and foremost.  We need to consider and work with people and listen to their fears and needs.  The will and preference of the young adult or adolescent will, of course, be taken into account.  Families know their child best and we are on the journey with them to enable them and their child to reach their full potential and to work with the various elements and services and pool those resources to get the maximum for the person and ensure he or she will live a valued life.

What the committee can do falls on two levels.  Pone is the policy level and the other is the sort of systems change level.  As I am sure members are aware, sections 3 to 13, inclusive, of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act have never been commenced.  Section 13 relates to the provision of resources.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has not yet been commenced.  Members will be familiar with the report of the ombudsman that calls for a revision of the Disability Act.  Many of the things we have discussed this afternoon actually stem from that Act because it gives a legal entitlement to an assessment but it does not give any entitlement to an intervention.  That has been one of the channels that has caused the blockages as many people want an assessment because they think it will lead to an intervention.  There should be a legal entitlement to intervention, which is of primary importance.<\/p> <p>  Standing back from that, members are aware we have been advocating for many years for more resources and that will be really important, but perhaps even more important than the issue of resources is the fact we currently have a system that is fragmented, unco-ordinated, inequitable and unfair.  The children's disability network teams, CDNTs, are about addressing those problems, so they are disrupting the way in which some resources are currently distributed.  Of course, some people will benefit more and others may benefit less or, indeed, may lose something, but we wish to be fully accountable to the committee in terms of what we do.  We would love to have its backing in terms of trying to be constructively disruptive within the system so that we can have a non-fragmented, well co-ordinated and, above all, fair system for all children with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their responses.  The contribution of Professor MacLachlan was very important in terms of recognising that no system is perfect.  What we wish to do is to try to ensure that when we take charge of things, we leave them better than how we found them.  What the committee wishes to do is to work with people to make sure we contribute in a positive way.  Parents in particular sometimes get frustrated by the sometimes fragmented nature of things.  That is not a criticism of anybody.<\/p> <p>  The other part of it is the challenge in respect of respite services for parents of children with disabilities.  There does not seem to be enough overnight respite available in localities.  I know it is costly, but it is something we might consider how we can best provide because I believe parents need that respite and break.  I know it is there if they need it.  As I stated previously, when we are in public life, there are certain things we see happening that we may not be very proud of.  I am involved with this committee to make sure that if there is anything we can do to improve the situation, that is done in co-operation with the witnesses.

Several points have been raised.  The written submission provided states the level of services available in special schools varies widely.  The witnesses have been upfront regarding the challenges that exist.  Many of the discussions the committee has had relate to the issue of the level of services available depending on the area in which you live or your postcode.  That is not acceptable.  It is one of the big challenges for the committee and the witnesses to lead in trying to ensure there is fair and equitable provision and that each child has universal access, no matter what their challenges or the part of the country in which he or she lives.  The traditional methods of delivering services are not fit for purpose going forward.  It is vital that access is universal rather than anything else.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that, for children with additional needs who do not have family resources behind them, the services they should be accessing, such as occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, are simply not available on the public system at the moment.  There are children going to special schools or other educational settings and who have not had sufficient access to services.  They may have seen an occupational therapist or a speech and language therapist three or four times in the past 12 months.  If a person had cancer and the treatment prescribed by the clinicians was to be administered three times a week or a month or whatever, that would be gone after hammer and tongs to ensure the service was delivered.  The challenge we have in the context of assessments of need is the waiting list that exists and the frustration parents and young kids experience when trying to get an assessment of need.  When the assessment of need is completed, there is almost an expectation that there would be services available for the kids from the public sector but that is not the case.  Such services are certainly not universal.  According to the statement submitted by the witnesses, the level of services available varies widely.  It is not acceptable in 2021 that we have to admit that services for young kids vary widely depending on where the child lives.<\/p> <p>  Our guests have been frank and open in their discussion.  There is a significant amount to be done.  As we go into the next period, there was a significant amount of work done.  I refer to the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in the context of securing the extra &euro;100 million and the extra moneys found with regard to various aspects of it.  We are going into a new budgetary term.  The budget will be presented in four months or five months and the committee needs to advocate as strongly as it can.  There is a need to be resourced on the side of the witnesses to identify the challenges facing us.  We must accept that many kids who undergo an assessment of need at which a need is identified are depending on the public purse to provide services but that, for many of them, those services are not available.  Many families in such a situation have contacted the offices of members and we try to scramble services on their behalf but the services are not there.<\/p><p>There is frustration among the service providers, the HSE, the therapists who are providing the therapy, the families and, most important, of the children who need it.  We all have to work extremely hard to improve that service.<\/p><p> Would Mr. Morgan like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021051300002#J00600","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I concur with what the Chairman said.  If I were to leave the committee with three points, the first would be that we would like it if the committee could become a champion for the progressive disability services model because if we agree on the principle, then there should be no argument.  The second point is about how we resource it.  I mentioned support to Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and to services on the ground around implementing the capacity review report.  Much effort by the officials of the Department of Health has gone into costing this.  There is a plan that will help us from the point of view of publishing and implementing the report.  That tells us what resources we need.  The final piece is around the change that comes with the model.  That brings change for us all, including for my colleagues around this table, but also for our colleagues who are on the front line.  It is a different way of working; it demands change.  Sometimes it demands that one leaves one's professional hat at the door and one puts the child and the family first.  Change is difficult, but that is what we are asking our clinical colleagues to do, namely, to put the family and the child first.<\/p> <p>  I really hope it is not inappropriate but when we are through this pandemic and when things have settled, we would be delighted to facilitate the committee if it wished to go and see a network team in operation.

This meeting clashes with Question Time with the Minister for Defence in the plenary session of the D&aacute;il in the national convention centre and some of our members are engaged in that business.  I welcome Deputy Boyd Barrett, who is not a member but a welcome participant.<\/p> <p>  Before we formally commence, I wish to convey my condolences to those injured and killed in the attacks on both sides of the conflict in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the region over the past few days.  At our meeting on Tuesday, I called on those with influence in the region to use that influence to stop the violence and indiscriminate attacks.  I repeat that call this morning on the basis that it is my firm belief that the way forward must involve dialogue and engagement by the international community with both sides of the conflict and the application, of course, of international law, being mindful of UN resolutions.<\/p> <p>  We are joined this morning by the ambassador of Israel to Ireland, H. E. Mr. Ophir Kariv, Ms Jackie Goodall and Ms Audrey Griffin of the Ireland Israel Alliance, Ms Natasha Hausdorff of UK Lawyers for Israel, and Mr. Alan Shatter, a former Oireachtas Member, a former member of this committee in a previous D&aacute;il and no stranger to these proceedings.  The witnesses are all very welcome and I thank them for meeting with us this morning.  Today's meeting is the second in a series reviewing the position in the occupied Palestinian territories in respect of displacements and the demolition of public and private buildings.  At our meeting on Tuesday, we heard from the ambassador and head of mission of Palestine and representatives of Sadaka.  A further meeting is scheduled for Tuesday of next week.  The committee has also sought written submissions from several interested parties and bodies.  Following our meetings and consideration of all submissions, it is our intention as a committee to publish a report.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting this morning is that we will hear opening statements from H. E. Mr. Kariv, Ms Goodall, Ms Hausdorff and Mr. Shatter, in that order, before proceeding to a question and answer session involving members and witnesses.  As we are limited to two hours, I ask that witnesses be conscious of the time constraints when initially addressing the committee.  Due to the changing circumstances in the region, I will allow some latitude to discuss the ongoing crisis.  However, I remind guests and members that the main purpose of the meeting is to inform committee members in respect of displacements and the demolition of public and private buildings in order for the committee to report on those matters.  I ask that members and witnesses be conscious of our terms of reference when speaking.  In the first round of questions, each member will have seven minutes for questions and answers.  After six minutes, I will indicate that there is one minute remaining.  Should time permit, we will open up the meeting at the end to deal with other outstanding issues.  However, as stated, the session must conclude within two hours, having regard to the Covid restrictions under which we are operating.<\/p> <p>   I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if any statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I need not remind our guests that it is imperative that any such direction be complied with immediately.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as do witnesses who are physically present in the building.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence given.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex or in the national convention centre, where some parliamentary sittings are taking place during the Covid pandemic.  For anybody watching this meeting online, some members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending remotely, I ask that everybody bear with us in the event of any issue of a technical nature arising.  I thank those responsible for the technical logistics for their work so far.  I hope matters proceed smoothly over the next two hours.<\/p> <p>  It gives me pleasure to call on Ambassador Kariv to make his opening statement to the committee.  He has the floor and he is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#A00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in this discussion.  The subject of today&rsquo;s meeting is an important one.  In addition to discussing the historical, legal and humanitarian aspects of the issue at hand, today&rsquo;s discussion can also be a starting point to explore the ways in which Ireland can constructively contribute to progress in the Middle East peace efforts in general and to Palestinian welfare in particular.<\/p> <p>  The area referred to today as the West Bank was first delineated in 1949 in the armistice agreement signed by Israel and Jordan following the Israeli war of independence.  That war was launched by the Arab world, including the Palestinians, to prevent implementation of the two-state solution, known as the partition plan, proposed by the UN General Assembly in 1947, accepted by the Jewish national leadership and rejected by the Arabs.  In that war, the newly-established state of Israel thwarted the co-ordinated attempt of five Arab armies and Palestinian militias to exterminate the nascent state.  In part due to inspiration by then Palestinian leader, the Nazi collaborator Haj Amin al-Husseini, not a single Jew remained in areas under Arab control in what used to be mandatory Palestine.  At the same time, Arabs living in Israel constitute today 20% of its population and enjoy full and equal civil rights.  After the war, that area was annexed by Jordan in an act recognised by only two states. <\/p> <p>  Israel gained control over the West Bank in 1967 following another war of self-defence forced on it by several Arab armies, including Jordan, which annexed that territory.  Following the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, PLO, the Palestinian National Authority was created and for the first time in their history, Palestinians achieved self-administration.  While Arab citizens of Israel are the only Arabs in the Middle East to enjoy full and equal civil rights in a real democracy, the only time the Palestinian national movement managed to produce any tangible achievements has been through direct negotiations with Israel.  <\/p> <p>  Area C, the geographical area we are discussing today, constitutes approximately 60% of the territory of Judea and Samaria, or the West Bank.  At the same time, it is home to less than 10% of Palestinians living in the West Bank, while over 90% live under full civil administration of the Palestinian National Authority in Areas A and B.  Those areas were agreed on and defined in the signed Oslo Accords.  These accords also specify that Area C remains under full Israeli control, both security and civil.  In the lack of progress in negotiations due to the years long Palestinian refusal to renew them, those agreements continue to serve as the legal and practical framework for everyday life in those areas. <\/p> <p>  The final status of these areas is one of the main issues to be negotiated in the framework of a final peace agreement which is for all our mutual benefit.  Israel has repeatedly shown its readiness to make painful compromises for the sake of genuine peace and we want to achieve a just and lasting peace with our Palestinian neighbours.  In the interim, in accordance with international law and the signed agreements, Israel continues to administer Area C through the military commander of Judea and Samaria.  Under the provisions of international law and the signed agreements, the Israeli authorities are also responsible for civil administration in Area C, including safety, planning and construction.  Therefore, all activities in these spheres have to be co-ordinated with the relevant Israeli authorities.  Israel is committed to carrying out its responsibilities in Area C to maintain law and order according to international law and the existing agreements.  <\/p> <p>  We call on all stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and foreign governments, to conduct their activities in this area in a responsible and lawful manner and to make sure all activities and projects are adequately co-ordinated with the relevant Israeli authorities.  We have the same interest to take care of, develop and promote Palestinian welfare.  <\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to the current situation in our region.  We just saw another night of barrages of indiscriminate rocket fire from the Gaza Strip by the Hamas terrorist organisation.  Our citizens, millions of Israelis, had to spend the night in shelters and safe rooms.  I know this first-hand from my family who live there and spent last night there.  I hope the committee will find room to condemn the terrorist attacks of Hamas with no reservations.  These attacks are unacceptable and I hope the committee believes that as well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#B00100","nonspeaker":"H.E. Mr. Ophir Kariv"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and committee for the invitation to speak this morning.  I will introduce Ms Audrey Griffin, who is a member of the Ireland Israel Alliance, and Mr. Alan Shatter, who is also a member and supporter of the organisation.  Ms Natasha Hausdorff will speak on behalf of UK Lawyers for Israel.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the members of the Ireland Israel Alliance, I offer my deepest condolences to all of those affected by over 1,200 Hamas rockets, and counting, raining down on Israel since Monday, a day when the people of Israel celebrated Jerusalem Day.  My condolences not only extend to Israeli citizens &ndash; Jews, Arabs and other minorities - but to the many Irish citizens with close family and friends in Israel and also members of the Palestinian communities, thousands of whom work in Israel daily ]to provide a better living for their families and the majority of whom want nothing more than to live in peace. <\/p> <p>  The Ireland Israel Alliance was established in 2018 because a growing number of Irish citizens were becoming increasingly concerned that the narrative circulating in the Irish public arena regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was disproportionately focused against Israel.  Our objective is to bring more balance to that narrative and to make a constructive contribution to the debate.  We support a two-state solution and we encourage and support peaceful coexistence between Arabs, Jews and other minorities living within Israel and in the Palestinian territories. <\/p> <p>  Sadly, however, we continue to witness from certain sectors of society in Ireland a wholly biased anti-Israel narrative.  It is to be variously found on our streets and television screens, in our national press and especially on social media, resulting in giving those who wish to see Israel destroyed the oxygen to breed discord and hate.  When Mark Twain visited the Holy Land in 1867, he wrote that it was &ldquo;a ... [desolate] heart-broken land.&rdquo;  Travelling on horseback through the Jezreel Valley he noted there was \"not a solitary village throughout its whole extent&rdquo; and that a person could travel for &ldquo;ten miles ... and not see ten human beings&rdquo;. <\/p> <p>  That said, there has been a continuous Jewish presence in Israel for 3,000 years, backed up by extensive and ongoing archaeological evidence.  The Jewish people have a deep connection and love for the land from which they were twice exiled.  Now back in their ancient homeland, they have always been, and continue to be, willing to share it.  However, every single offer of peace so far has been rejected by the Palestinian leadership.  <\/p> <p>  We firmly believe that the existence of Jewish communities within Palestinian areas is not an obstacle to peace, but an opportunity for coexistence and reconciliation.  A prime example is Gaza.  I visited Israel in 2005 when I witnessed approximately 8,000 Jewish people forcefully removed under the direction of Israel&rsquo;s then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, in a well-meaning but failed attempt at land for peace.  Today, not one single Jewish person lives in Gaza, never mind a Jewish community.  <\/p> <p>  Shortly after Israel&rsquo;s disengagement from Gaza and its takeover by the internationally recognised terrorist group Hamas, their militants started killing their Palestinian rivals by throwing them off 15-storey buildings and mutilating their bodies in the most barbaric ways.<\/p><p>In addition, greenhouses and irrigation systems left by the departing Gaza Jewish communities were smashed and destroyed.<\/p><p> Do not get me wrong.  We are not anti-Palestinian; quite the contrary.  Sadly, many of Israel&rsquo;s enemies are both anti-Israel and anti-Palestinian, because they are more interested in persistent efforts to demonise, delegitimise and socially isolate the sovereign and democratic state of Israel than in trying to improve the lives of the Palestinian people and encourage Palestinian economic development within Palestinian areas.<\/p><p> The Ireland Israel Alliance took a delegation to visit Jewish towns and developments and joint Jewish-Israeli-Palestinian industrial estates in the West Bank and Jordan Valley in 2019.  There we witnessed Palestinian and Jewish communities working and studying together and enjoying peaceful and harmonious coexistence.  Interestingly, we discovered in a business we visited in the Barkan industrial estate that the manager in charge was a local Palestinian who managed a workforce of both Israelis and Palestinians.  The truth is that these communities desperately want peace, an end to the conflict and economic stability.<\/p><p> One of the Jewish families we visited in the Jordan Valley told us they regularly visit Palestinian villages, have Palestinian friends and often attend each other&rsquo;s family celebrations, including weddings and bar mitzvahs.  However, many of these hardworking and peaceful Palestinians are afraid to publicly admit this because of intimidation and harassment from the Palestinian Authority.  Palestinian leaders do not need to care about the welfare of Palestinians, because they will use any opportunity to avoid having elections.  Palestinian leaders benefit from the dependency of Palestinians on massive external aid which provides opportunities for the diversion of funds to their own pockets, not to mention their notorious &ldquo;pay for slay&rdquo; policy that incentivises and rewards the murder of Jewish Israelis.  Incitement to violence has long been a favoured tactic of the Palestinian leadership, as we are currently witnessing.  When demands for violence using the code \"peaceful popular resistance\" in the name of protecting Jerusalem are broadcast by Palestinian media, the Palestinian public understands exactly what is required of them.<\/p><p> The Jordan Valley is a vast area and represents the best of Israeli ingenuity.  Apart from the Palestinian city of Jericho, the remaining 200,000 acres of desert land were largely vacant until Israelis started developing the region in 1968.  Despite the challenges of lack of sufficient water resources and intense heat, it produces a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and is known as a world leader in the Medjoul date market, with 6,200 acres farmed by Israelis and 3,000 acres farmed by Palestinians.  In the Barkan industrial zone in the northern West Bank alone, there are some 164 factories employing about 7,200 workers, of whom about 4,000 are Palestinians, many of them in management positions.  The employment of Palestinians in Israeli businesses in the West Bank promotes peace and reconciliation through the good relations created between Israelis and Palestinians working together.<\/p><p> In 2018, the Ireland Israel Alliance submitted a report to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence regarding the Occupied Territories Bill, legislation which seeks to boycott Israeli settlements in the West Bank and parts of Jerusalem.  Proponents of the Bill seem to believe that this will promote the prospect of peace in the Middle East and benefit Palestinians.  In our view, it would have exactly the opposite effect.  Not only that, but a draconian and discriminatory Bill that threatens Irish citizens who trade with Israeli businesses in the West Bank and parts of Jerusalem with fines of up to &euro;250,000 and a five-year prison term is hardly the way to encourage good relationships between Israeli people and Irish people.  It serves only to cause more suspicion and division.<\/p><p> In the context of the barrage of over 1,200 rockets fired indiscriminately into Israeli civilian territory and the multiple Israeli casualties since Monday, I will finish with a personal story of a visit our delegation took to the Ziv Medical Center in the north of Israel, 11 km from the border with Lebanon and 30 km from Syria.  The staff are multi-ethnic, reflecting the wonderful mosaic of people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds, including Muslims, Christians, Jews, Bedouin and Druze.  This gives the lie to the absurd claim that Israel is an apartheid state.  We met the hospital&rsquo;s general director, Dr. Salman Zarka, himself a Druze, who spoke to us about the unique security challenges the hospital faces.<\/p><p> During the Second Lebanon War of 2006, the hospital took direct hits from Hezbollah missiles while staff continued to treat 1,500 wounded Syrians, sometimes under fire.  At the height of the Syrian civil war, the hospital provided unique humanitarian aid to some 5,000 Syrians, many of them unaccompanied children.  By 2013, the battle in Syria spread to Israel&rsquo;s border and the wounded started to arrive.  Under international law, it is acceptable to close your border in times of war.  However, Israel is known for providing humanitarian aid to people all over the world.  The hospital decided to provide medical help to wounded Syrians and set up a field hospital at the border with an intensive care unit.  Later, it evacuated them to the Ziv hospital before sending them back to Syria.<\/p><p> Before we left, Dr. Zarka told us that they are praying and hoping for peace but that they have to be ready for war.  Dr. Zarka&rsquo;s comments resonate with everyone I spoke to during our time in Israel, and also with those Israelis, both Jewish and Arab, that I communicate with on a daily basis.  The people of Israel, and many Palestinians, are crying out for peace, literally.<\/p><p> I therefore ask members of this committee to ensure that any decisions they make of relevance to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or which could detrimentally impact upon Israel do not exclude Ireland from playing a practical role in reigniting a viable peace process and that decisions made by the committee are ones that encourage and promote peace and not division, remembering that truth does not always belong to those who shout loudest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jackie Goodall","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I appear before the committee not as a representative of the state of Israel but as a legal practitioner and the legal director of UK Lawyers for Israel, UKLFI, charitable trust.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to address the slew of falsehoods delivered to this committee two days ago.  It is with great concern that I address, first and most important, how Irish aid is being hoodwinked to devote funds to a political campaign and funnelled into illegal building projects which fuel the conflict and perpetuate Palestinian suffering.  Second, I will address the underlying legal status of the disputed territory.  Third, I propose to explain the specific instance of the recent property dispute in Sheikh Jarrah and the context in which illegal squatters face eviction.<\/p> <p>  This hearing takes place in shocking circumstances, in the context of a campaign of terror waged by Palestinian terrorist groups as part of an internal Palestinian power struggle and with the aim of Israel's destruction.<\/p><p>What all the presentations on Tuesday left out is Palestinian terrorism, which has been the hallmark of the last few days and has blighted Israel's 73 years of existence.  It has been incited and encouraged by the same fabrications that were aired in this committee two days ago.  To describe Israel as colonialist is an outrage.  Jews, who had been persecuted around the world, found shelter among their brothers in their homeland and paid dearly in blood to survive years of onslaught by invading Arab armies, many having themselves been ethnically cleansed from those same Arab countries, are now being called colonialist for the crime of their continued existence.  <br\/><br\/>It cannot be overstressed that Irish aid funding for illegal building projects in Area C does a great deal of harm.  The Palestinian Authority has full planning control over Areas A and B, where more than 70% of the land is suitable for development and empty.  There are indeed opportunities for development, such as the impressive building projects in Rawabi, the first planned Palestinian town, which I have had the privilege of visiting many times.  Aid could be going to planned initiatives which would help ordinary local people.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to the building projects at Khirbet Humsah, firing range 203 in the Jordan Valley, also called Humsa Al Bqai'a, and the firing range 917 in the Hebron hills, these are not Palestinian communities.  These areas have always been state land since the time of the Ottomans and were designated by the IDF as training grounds because of uninhabitable conditions.  No peace-promoting purpose is served by building illegally in the middle of a firing range, removed from basic municipal services such as water, electricity, sewerage systems and links to other communities.  It is illegal outposts built without planning permission or permits that are subject to removal and demolition, just as they would be if I or members of the committee sought to build on the Curragh in County Kildare or the Salisbury Plain firing range in England without planning permission and a permit. <br\/><br\/>It is important that we are clear about the underlying legal status of the territory through the proper application of universal principles of international law.  There is a fundamental principle of customary international law which establishes the borders of newly emerging states at independence, as in Israel's case in 1948.  It is universally applied.  In the 19th century the principle was applied in South America, later it was applied in Asia and Africa and, still later, at the disintegration of the former communist federations.  It has been applied to all the states that emerged in all these cases, as well as to states emerging from former mandates.  The universal rule for determining the borders of newly emerging states at the moment of independence dictates that the new state takes on the boundaries of the pre-existing administrative unit as its interactional borders.  The principle is called <i>uti possidetis juris<\/i>.  It is the default rule to provide certainty, avoid frontiers being challenged, avoid wars breaking out and promote peace and stability.  Those are the reasons the International Court of Justice, ICJ, recognised as being behind the development of this fundamental principle.<br\/><br\/>Another fundamental principle of international law is equal application.  One cannot have a general rule and an exception for a country that one just does not like very much or to which one has some ideological and-or political opposition.  That is not how any responsible legal system can operate.  The question then is what does this principle, universally applied, tell us about the legal status of the territory in Israel's case.  In 1948, the administrative lines of the eastern side of the British Mandate for Palestine ran along the Jordan river all the way to the south, originally dividing it from the separate administrative unit of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.  By the way, Jordan's borders also follow the principle of <i>uti possidetis juris<\/i>.  Israel, as the only state to emerge from the British Mandate for Palestine territory in 1948, automatically assumed as its borders the administrative lines of the former mandate territory, and that included eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank which were areas occupied by Jordan in 1948 during Israel's war of independence.  These same areas were recovered by Israel in 1967.  <br\/><br\/>The legal status of that territory applying this principle is that Israel has been the sovereign since 1948 and Israel's borders were those of the British Mandate for Palestine territory which preceded it, except where otherwise agreed upon by Israel and its relevant neighbour.  Indeed, Israel's peace treaties with its neighbouring states to date, namely, Egypt and Jordan, reinforce that reading because the treaties ratify borders between Israel and its neighbours explicitly based on the boundaries of the British Mandate for Palestine.  There has been no agreement of any kind on the transfer of sovereignty since 1948.  In the 1990s, Israel entered into agreements with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation to divide up administrative control.  Areas A and B were to be under the territorial control of the PLO and Area C remained under Israeli territorial control.  All the agreements have been explicit about not addressing issues of national sovereignty.  That has been left open for future final status agreements.  Therefore, we are left with the original general doctrine regarding the new state incorporating the territory of the previous administrative unit.  <br\/><br\/>I noted several references on Tuesday to the case of Crimea.  Ukraine still has sovereignty over Crimea, despite Russia's invasion, and that goes back to the principle of <i>uti possidetis juris<\/i>and the administrative boundaries of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  When it became independent, it did so in the entire administrative unit of the former Soviet republic.  If Ukraine were to one day recover Crimea from Russia, as Israel did with eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan in 1967, no one here would accuse Ukraine of being in occupation of Crimea.  <br\/><br\/>Much has been made, for political purposes in recent days, of the property dispute in Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.  Israel's critics have distorted the facts, perverted international law and attempted to intimidate the courts and law enforcement officials into adopting a bigoted approach, demanding that the state defy court orders and deny the property owners their legal rights on the basis of the race of the relevant parties.  The current dispute in Sheikh Jarrah involves several properties of tenants whose leases have expired and, in a few cases, squatters with no tenancy rights against owner landlords who have successfully won court orders evicting the squatters and overstaying tenants.  <br\/><br\/>Litigation of these properties has been an ongoing subject for decades and the case has gone all the way to the Supreme Court.  The owners in these disputes acquired their rights through an uninterrupted chain of transactions from predecessors in title in the 19th century.  These legal rights were acquired under Ottoman law and have remained good through all subsequent government regimes, namely, the British Mandate for Palestine, Jordanian occupation and purported annexation, and Israeli.  No one seriously disputes the validity of the transactions through which the current owners acquired rights from their predecessors in title.  The tenants in these disputes acquired their leasehold rights through a chain running from the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property in the 1950s.  Their rights as leaseholders, not owners, were reaffirmed in several court rulings that culminated in 1982 with Israel's civil courts issuing rulings adopting settlement agreements between the leaseholders' predecessors in title and the owners.<br\/><br\/>The only break in the owners' uninterrupted chain of title is the seizure of these properties from 1948 to 1967 by the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property.  This is when Jordan, which had illegally occupied eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank during its invasion of Israel in 1948, ethnically cleansed these areas of all Jews.  Jordan transferred custody over all Jewish-owned property to the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property.  However, it never transferred title to any party and it never extinguished the owners' rights.  Instead, the custodian leased some of the properties to Arabs, who were the predecessors to the current overstaying tenants.  <br\/><br\/>When Israel regained the territory in 1967 and Jordan's occupation of eastern Jerusalem ended, Israel adopted legislation which vindicated the private property rights of persons of all ethnicities.<\/p><p>The Legal and Administrative Matters Law 1970 preserved the rights of private parties who received title from the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property.  Notwithstanding the illegality of Jordan's occupation, those who received rights from the Jordanian custodian were all Arabs, since Jordanian law denied property rights to Jews.  Ironically, if the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property had assigned title to the predecessors of the current Arab holdover tenants over the lands it seized from Jewish owners, Israeli law would have respected the resulting title.<\/p><p> The reason the holdover tenants in Sheikh Jarrah lack ownership today is not because the State of Israel has denied Palestinians any rights they acquired but, rather, because the Government of Jordan declined to give Palestinian Arabs title to the land Jordan had seized.  Israel has not granted anyone ownership of any of the affected properties and Israeli law respects and upholds the property rights of persons of all ethnicities.  Israel has even respected the property rights created by prior regimes that explicitly discriminated against Jews in their property law, namely, the Ottoman Empire, the British Mandate of Palestine and the Jordanian occupation regime.  That is the reality.  The claim of illegality is fabricated.

I believe Ireland, from its own perspective, has a unique contribution it could make to reigniting what is a moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  Sadly, to date, not only does Ireland not make that contribution but, in stances on occasion taken, it places itself in a position where it lacks credibility to engage in a constructive manner in the peace process.  I have for many years been an advocate and supporter of a two-state solution.  I have met with many of the Israeli political leaders and many of the Palestinian leaders, including President Abbas on a number of occasions and the late Saeb Erekat, who was one of the principal negotiators.  Tragically, the successful agreed implementation of a two-state solution remains a distant dream and we now find ourselves with yet another tragically unnecessary conflict, with lives being unnecessarily lost and further division created.<br\/><br\/>I followed Tuesday's meeting of this committee with great interest.  I noted that, understandably in the current unfortunate circumstances, it went beyond the original subject matter of the meeting, as the Chairman mentioned.  I am going to touch on a couple of aspects of that.  I also have to say that I found the meeting particularly depressing as an observer because no hard questions were asked in response to presentations made.  No matter what side they are on, and I do not believe members of the foreign affairs committee should be on any side other than Ireland's side, it behoves members to ask the hard questions and tease out propositions that are presented before it.  No mention was made of UN Resolution 181, which envisaged in 1947 the creation of both a Jewish and an Arab state.  It also envisaged something that seems to have been forgotten, namely, Jewish and Arab minorities peacefully living in each state.  It never envisaged the Jewish people living in an Arab state and being pejoratively labelled as settlers or that the Arab state to emerge from the 1947 resolution would be <i>judenfrei<\/i>, that is, free of all Jews and with no Jews permitted to reside in it.  Of course, that resolution referred to a Jewish state and an Arab state and made no reference at the time to what we all now perceive to be, and hope some time in the future will be, a Palestinian state.<br\/><br\/>No mention was made at the committee meeting of Resolution 181 or its importance as a bedrock resolution to where we are today.  No mention was made of the divisions between Fatah and Hamas and that, for 14 years, Gaza and the West Bank have been ruled by two entirely separate political entities, often in violent confrontation with each other.  No mention was made that Hamas remains committed to Israel's total destruction, an objective supported by Iran.  There was no mention that President Abbas and members of the Palestinian Authority regularly and ludicrously claim the Jewish people have no historical connection to Jerusalem, to today's Israel and to parts of the Palestinian-administered territory.  There was no questioning of the contention that no Jewish person should reside in the West Bank, or what is known to many Jewish people as Judea and Samaria.  There is something vaguely ludicrous about wrongly accusing Israel of being an apartheid state while advocating that there should be no Jewish community located on any part of what might in the future be Palestinian territory or in any part of what is currently referenced internationally as either the West Bank or Judea and Samaria.<br\/><br\/>There was no questioning of Iran's role in fomenting division and in regard to the current conflict.  There was no mention of the shooting of three 19-year-old Israeli students, one of whom has since died, at a bus stop.  That happened ten days ago, before the current rocket firing commenced.  There was no mention of Hamas celebrating that event.  There was no mention of a Palestinian education system, partially paid for by Irish taxpayers, that brainwashes young children to hate, celebrates atrocities and encourages martyrdom.  That system is creating generations who will oppose any reasonable peace resolution that may at some time in the future emerge.  The manner in which schoolchildren have been taught is creating a series of inflexible generations who will never engage in any support for a compromise solution.  There was no mention of the Palestinian Authority's pay for slay programme, a very basic issue on which I would have thought the Palestinian ambassador would be questioned.<br\/><br\/>There was no mention of paid Hamas operatives regularly rioting at the Gaza border with Israel.  There was no mention of the projectiles regularly fired from Gaza into Israel, putting lives at risk and causing fires and major environmental damage to forests originally planted on barren land.  No mention was made of the intensifying of the firing of such projectiles on Wednesday of last week as a preliminary to the Hamas rockets that are currently hitting Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Shatter"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to intervene but I must do so on the basis of the time constraint under which we are operating.

I find the entire situation going on within Gaza at this point, where we have seen up to 69 people butchered, deeply depressing.  I also find it depressing that not one of our speakers this morning could express any sympathy or remorse for any loss of life, either in Israel or in the Palestinian Territories.  I find that deeply, deeply depressing.  I offer my sympathies to the families of everyone who has lost their life.<\/p> <p>  The blockade of Gaza and the indiscriminate bombing are a collective punishment.  We have seen residential buildings being targeted by Israel; we have seen police stations, a university, power lines, post offices and media towers being hit.  The charge that has been made is that this is all an act of self-defence.  How is butchering 69 people in indiscriminate bombings within Gaza self-defence?  Of course,17 children were killed.  I am holding a photograph of two of them here, Maryam and Zayed.  Together with their mother Rima, who was pregnant, they were butchered in Gaza as part of Israel's self-defence.  How can the witnesses justify that?  They should have a good look at those children.  A total of 17 children were killed.  Are these Hamas terrorists?  The witnesses might answer that question.  How does Israel reconcile its actions within Gaza under international law?  Under the Geneva Convention what Israel is perpetrating is a war crime.<\/p> <p>  I fundamentally believe all people have equal rights and the annexation that is ongoing in East Jerusalem, the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan and constant settlement expansion, are the root causes of what is happening at this point in time.  Do the witnesses blame Israel's own actions, in terms of the settlement expansions, the land-taking, the home demolitions, the evictions and the removal of Palestinians from areas Israel covets as the actual cause of the current crisis? <\/p> <p>  I have studied the maps of Palestine.  I am sure everyone has looked at the map of 1967.  It shows a continuous West Bank.  What is left now after the illegal settlements and the annexation is a series of bantustans which look like South African ones, and we are familiar with the apartheid system that was in place in there.  Is the apartheid system from South Africa the model Israel is using as a blueprint at this point?  Since 1967 there have been more than 250 illegal Israelis settlements established throughout the West Bank and East Jerusalem, inhabited by more than 650,000 settlers, with more than 250,000 occupying settlements in East Jerusalem.  It is very clear from these illegal settlements, the application of laws and the pillaging of Palestinian resources that Israel has annexed massive parts of the West Bank.  Does Israel intend on staying within the lands it occupies and has annexed since 1967?  Its political leaders have stated they will never, ever leave those lands.  Do our guests see a two-state solution as viable?  If they do, I ask that they define what that solution would look like and what borders it wouldcontain.  Why is it apparently legal for Jews to come and claim property in Israel while Palestinians do not have the same rights to claim homes and villages lost in 1948, and subsequently?<\/p> <p>  The Knesset is voting to legalise settlement outposts in the West Bank and to re-establish four settlements which Israel previously removed.  How is that not annexation and how is it not a provocation and a cause of the conflict playing out at the moment?  Having mentioned the Knesset, I raise the enactment of the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, which came in on 19 July 2018.  It sets forth the constitutional order of Israel and articulates the ethnic-religious identity of the state as exclusively Jewish.  It alters the constitutional framework of the state, making changes that violate established international norms and bears distinct characteristics of apartheid.  There is no democratic constitution in the world, that I can see, that designates the constitutional identity of the state on racial grounds, as serving one ethnic group on this basis, namely, this discriminatory law.<\/p><p>How does the ambassador believe that all citizens of Israel can enjoy equal rights?<\/p><p> I refer to the International Criminal Court, which is carrying out an investigation of war crimes perpetrated by Israel.  Will Israel co-operate with that investigation?  Pretending that the court does not have jurisdiction is not going to be much of an argument.  Ireland strongly believes that the International Criminal Court is the body that should adjudicate on all matters such as what is being, and has been, done by Israel.  It is imperative that the court has complete freedom to conduct its investigation.<\/p><p> I wish to raise a few other points.

Our sympathy goes to everybody who is bereaved.  However, to get to the real issue, would our guests, led by the ambassador, accept the contention that there is a particular onus on Israel as the most powerful in the situation to move for peace immediately, as has been requested by President Biden and across the world?  In that context, would they accept that the moral responsibility to move for peace is added to by what happened at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the police involvement there, the recent spate of demolitions and the takeover of properties?<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of the time and the Chairman can interrupt me if I go over, but I wish to briefly go through some figures.  In 2020, demolitions increased to 535, with 169 in Area C.  The home demolitions and displacements in 2020 brought about the movement of 941 persons - 462 women, 442 children, 267 students and 124 refugees.  Under accelerated settlements expansion, the construction of 3,512 settlement units was tendered.  Israel appropriated 20 dunams, or 5,000 acres, of the Palestinian occupied lands.  I will refer to 2021 before leaving the figures.  The 2021 monthly number of structures demolished or seized averaged 117 compared with 71 in previous years, with 305 individuals affected and 172 minors.  Of course, there are the outstanding cases that came into focus recently.<\/p> <p>  My first question is about Israel taking the initiative on peace.  I put in that context the fact that there is an outbreak of civil disobedience and trouble, which is so tragic, between Arab and Israeli people in Israel itself.  Would all logic not suggest that the best option for Israel is Irish policy?  There is no threat to the Israeli state in Irish policy.  Irish policy is a two-state solution.  Would the witnesses not accept that the best position for Israel is to achieve a Palestinian state and a two-state solution, from an Israeli point of view of pure self-interest?<\/p> <p>  Would the witnesses accept - this a real concern and our primary focus today is demolitions - that the demolitions, their nature and the way they are being carried out are putting the two-state solution at risk?  If there are demolitions and settlements in villages and areas, that would make it impossible to get a unified, coherent two-state solution with a separate Palestinian state.  There is a problem there.  Would they accept the contention that is made that this is almost a policy?  If it is not a policy, would they accept that under international law and moral law the settlements and demolitions should stop?<\/p> <p>  The obvious situation we require here is peace.  We can only do so much.  We are active at the UN Security Council.  I believe the witnesses would accept that the statements from Ireland have been very balanced all the time, in the sense that all we have asked for, even no later than last evening by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is the implementation and maintenance of international law and the maintenance of UN resolutions and recommendations.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of justice, structures and so forth in the Palestinian territories.  Something was mentioned the other day and it is fair to put it to the witnesses.  They would probably argue that we should have put more to the other side, and that is their view, but the entire infrastructure being built is prejudicial not only to a two-state solution but even to the proper coexistence of people at present, with distinct roadways and a general distinct segregation system for people.<\/p> <p>  In summary, this country speaks from a perspective of peace and goodwill.  First, do the witnesses think that Israel must move on peace, do the big thing there and almost unilaterally create peace?  Second, do they accept that the demolitions and settlements should stop and that they are ultimately a threat to a two-state solution?  Third, do they accept that there should not be a set of laws or infrastructure in the occupied territories that are likely to result in the alienation and segregation of people and prejudice a two-state solution?  I appreciate the witnesses' presence and their willingness to confront the issues publicly, given the dreadful backdrop we have which is something that traumatises any reasonable person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#G00500","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I will call on the panel now, commencing with the ambassador to whom direct questions were put.

The Chairman can draw it to my attention if I do.<\/p> <p>  Senator Wilson raised the Irish contribution to the process in general and to ending the current conflict in Gaza.  Yes, we believe Ireland can make a positive and constructive contribution to the peace efforts.<\/p><p>This can be done on several levels.  On the ground, we believe we can co-operate with Ireland in projects contributing to the welfare of Palestinians and capacity building of Palestinians.  We have been doing that to an extent.  There is at least one such project in Gaza, co-ordinated with the Israeli authorities, which Ireland and, I believe, France, are carrying out together.  This is an important point because projects which are being co-ordinated with Israel will find an open door on our side.<\/p><p> Another level on which I believe Ireland can help is contributing to both sides from its own experience in solving such complex conflicts.  I remind everyone that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict goes back many years and has many dimensions, including national, geographical, historical and sometimes even religious aspects.  We hope it does not turn into a religious conflict.  Ireland and Irish people know all too well the meaning of such complex and sensitive conflicts.  It is true that these are different stories and the conflicts are not identical but the main points of knowing how to listen to both sides and taking into account the interests, feelings and sensitivities of both sides are essential.<\/p><p> I would be very careful in drawing parallels between the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Irish history and the conflict on the island of Ireland.  The one aspect we can draw on confidently is that of complexity.  Anyone approaching this type of conflict must bear this in mind.  Things are not simple, black and white or one-dimensional.  It is very easy to look at them this way but that misses the point entirely.  In Ireland, perhaps more than in any other European country, this type of approach should be appreciated.  <\/p><p> Another level on which I believe Ireland can help in contributing to both sides derives from its own experience in solving such complex conflicts.  I remind everyone here again that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one that goes back many years and has many dimensions, whether does are national, geographical, historical and sometimes even religious, although we do hope it does not turn into a religious conflict.  Ireland and Irish people know all too well the meaning of such complex and sensitive conflicts.  It is true that these are different stories, and the conflicts are not identical.

I will be very careful in drawing parallels between the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Irish history and the conflict on the island of Ireland.  One part of it, however, on which we can draw confidently is the issue of complexity.  Anyone who approached this kind of conflict must bear this in mind.

Again, especially in Ireland, perhaps more than in any other European country, this approach should be appreciated.  <\/p><p> If we speak about Irish contributions, these would be practical contributions on the ground in co-ordination with Israel and, in the broader dimension and perspective, the approach of assisting in finding ways to perhaps eventually find a way to achieve reconciliation and a political settlement which meet the needs of Israelis and Palestinians.<\/p><p> When it comes to ending what is happening now in Gaza and Israel, we need a clear stand.  The fact is that Hamas started the barrages of rockets into Israel, and not just Israel, but specifically population centres and civilians and continues to do so.  The international community, including Ireland, should speak with a clear voice that puts things in their place.  Hamas is a terrorist organisation, and is designated as such in Europe.  It has hijacked the people of Gaza.  My heart goes out to the average Gazan.  Do not get me wrong.  I want to clarify this point.  My heart goes out to the people of Gaza who are practically being held hostage there by Hamas.  By the way, when it comes to casualties, we should remember that some 30% of Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets are falling in Gaza itself since this round of conflict started.  That has caused many casualties, including children.  The international community should be very clear on this issue when it comes to dealing with this terrorist organisation.  I am sorry, but when it comes to Hamas there is no other way to look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#G00700","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Many issues were already addressed in my opening remarks, so I will restrict myself to the new material.  The current situation is not a spontaneous escalation.  This has been planned.  Hamas has been stockpiling weapons and rebuilding its terror network with Iranian backing since the last conflict in 2014.  This is why we see more sophisticated weaponry, including Iranian Fajr-5 rockets and heavy mortars, and tactics being developed to attempt to overwhelm Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system which protects the civilian population from bombardment.  It is important to stress to the members of the committee the indiscriminate nature of Hamas missile attacks.  An estimated one third of these missiles have been falling short in Gaza killing Palestinian civilians.  Yes, Hamas is killing its own people and, devastatingly, this is nothing new.  It is also blaming Israel for these killings, which is also nothing new.<\/p> <p>  The committee does not have to take my word for that.  It can take it from the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, which is based in the Gaza Strip, which reported the deaths of those children and the al-Masri family before Israel's response in Gaza began.  That is not to mention the Hamas missile which fell short destroying electricity infrastructure and leaving 100,000 people without electricity and cutting off a hospital.  We must be absolutely clear about the origins of this latest round of violence.  It arises from a power struggle between the Palestinian terrorist groups of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah.  An internal conflict within Hamas between Mohammad Deif and Yahya Sinwar has been brewing.  Tensions were sparked by Mahmoud Abbas's decision to cancel the Palestinian elections because he believed he was going to lose.  He is currently in his 16th year of his final four-year term.   <\/p> <p>  The month of Ramadan is usually tense due to extreme incitement by Arab leaders.  Over the course of this month, the conflict began with random attacks on Jews in Jerusalem by gangs of Arabs.  That quickly escalated, as it was encouraged over social media, to violent riots, first on the Temple Mount and then across Israel.  More recently, elements of the Israeli-Arab population have started to set fire to cities where Arabs and Jews live together.  A minority of Arabs in Haifa, Acre, Ramle and Lod are now promoting rogue elements in the Jewish population there to respond.  This has been resoundingly condemned by the Israeli leadership, which has been calling for restraint.  Social media has played a significant role in Hamas incitement of the Arab population, encouraging Arabs to buy knives for the equivalent of &euro;1.25 to cut the throats of any Jews they can find.  <\/p> <p>  Senior Hamas leader, Fathi Hammad, declared on 7 May that he wanted the people of Jerusalem to cut off the heads of Jews with knives.  In the days leading up to the riots on the Temple Mount compound, Palestinians stockpiled stone slabs, rocks and fireworks around the site.  Thousands of worshippers leaving Friday prayers hurled rocks at Israeli police officers guarding the site, who responded to contain the violence.  These rioters were hurling rocks onto the Western Wall plaza and on to Jewish worshippers who had to be evacuated.  These rioters claimed they were Hamas and shouted that Tel Aviv should be bombed.

The assumption of an occupation or that the presence of Israeli Jews living in the West Bank is in some way an offence to international law is nonsensical.<\/p> <p>  To address Deputy Brady's questions on international law with respect to Israel's recent conduct, it is clear that the IDF adhere to standards well beyond those required by international law.  The measures taken by the Israeli army to prevent civilian casualties are well known and they have been practised through the recent conflicts with the Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip.  They include devoting time to calling individual householders, informing them of strikes that are planned.  They include sending messages via text and also dropping leaflets.  There is also the now renowned knock-on-roof tactic.  That is why, when one looks at the videos coming out of the Gaza Strip over the last few days, one does not see civilians running from strikes because they have already been given the warning.  It is Hamas rockets that fall indiscriminately upon the Palestinian civilians who have no shelters because the Palestinian terrorists put their bombs in shelters and their civilians on top of their bombs of them.  That is the inversion that was already aired earlier today.<\/p> <p>  So far as the breaches of international law that were alleged with respect to Israel's conduct in terms of passing its nation's state law, the fact that this is being challenged is, in my submission, a perfect indication of why nation state law is so important as a constitutional affirmation of Israel's status as a sovereign Jewish nation state.  The eagerness of so many to denounce as undemocratic a measure that is considered mundane elsewhere is instructive.  This was a crucial part of Israel's constitutional process and reflected the key components of the declaration of independence.<\/p> <p>  With respect to settlements, I must question the logic of many of the questions that were posed over Jews living in communities in Judea and Samaria.  If settlements were important to the Palestinians, they would have brought their leadership to the negotiation table sooner rather than later.  As for the West Bank, anyone can drive from the southern to the northern end of the Jordan Valley without encountering a checkpoint.  Route 90 is accessible to everyone.  Therefore, claims that this committee has heard, that a family from Jericho cannot go and float in the Dead Sea, are just false.  There is no impediment to accessing the northern part of the Dead Sea.

For the record, I would like to ensure that it is known that in my opening statement, I offered sincere condolences not only to all Israeli citizens, Jews and Arabs alike, but also to all of the Palestinian communities that are affected, many of whom come into Israel on a daily basis to work to provide for a better living for their families, and also, just as the ambassador did, to the people in Gaza.  There are many innocent Palestinians in Gaza who do not wish to see this war.  They also want peace but they are under the control of a radical Islamist terrorist regime.  It is very important that people actually understand that and the fact that its official policy is to establish an Islamist state from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.  We often hear the phrase, \"From the river to the sea.\"  What does that actually mean?  It means the establishment of an Islamist state from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to refer to Deputy Brady's comment about the deaths that have occurred.  I believe he used the phrase, \"the butchering of children in Gaza\". I remind the Deputy that Hamas fires indiscriminately from heavily populated areas in Gaza - underneath hospitals, in mosques and in private houses.  They are firing those rockets from heavily populated areas in Gaza, indiscriminately, into heavily populated areas in Israel.  That is a double war crime.  I have been researching this whole area for many years and I know it to be fact that Israel does everything in its power not to cause any civilian casualties.  All of the rockets that are fired from Israel result in very direct hits, targeting military rocket launchers and terrorists.  It does not fire at civilians.  I would like that to be put on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Jackie Goodall"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I will go back to members of the committee.

My questions are shadowed by the statement of the Israeli defence minister that Israel will not stop its military operation in Gaza until \"complete quiet\" has been achieved.<\/p> <p>  My first question is to the ambassador.  Does he accept that much of the violence is motivated by the forced expulsions and the violence that has been seen at the Al-Aqsa Mosque?  What does he expect to happen if Israel continues its policy - which has been in existence for decades - of removing people from land they have held?  Does he accept that Israel is provoking the situation?<\/p> <p>  My second point relates to the rules of engagement for the potential invasion of Gaza as set out by Israel, and some of the conflict or recent days and weeks which has resulted in 69 deaths in Gaza.  How does the ambassador distinguish between \"shielding\", which is a legalistic term that has implications, and urban warfare?  In a densely populated zone such as Gaza where over 2 million people live, how does he distinguish between shielding, which he has used to justify and explain the deaths of innocent civilians and combatants, and urban warfare?<\/p><p>If a Hamas militant is in a building, would that building automatically be made a legitimate target in Gaza?  Is the same standard applied to places where the IDF is in Israel?<\/p><p> My next question is to the former Minister for Defence, Mr. Shatter, and it concerns some of the rhetoric used by the current Israeli Minister of Defence, Mr. Benny Gantz, since his 2019 election campaign.  He might be aware of his 2019 election campaign video, which highlighted his credentials as a wartime general and referred to the actions taken by Israel in Gaza in 2014, of which he was a lead component.  His election video had a counter of the number of what he referred to as Hamas terrorists who died, which extended to 1,412.  Even by the IDF's own count, many of those were unrecognised victims.  Does Mr. Shatter believe that is an appropriate way for a minister of defence to behave or are such actions tantamount to provocation to inevitable war?<\/p><p> Ms Hausdorff referred to the 1967 Jordanian agreements and indicates the leaseholds held by the Palestinian residents being expelled from Sheikh Jarrah are only there since 1967.  If those leaseholds mean they do not have territorial rights to the land, does the witness believe these people have the right to return to the land from which they were displaced before that period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#J01000","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>We should all accept there is no such thing as one-sided war and no one side is ever on its own.  We should also acknowledge today that Ireland has significant interest in what goes on in the Middle East and has troops on the ground out there on all sides.  My thoughts are with them.<\/p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, Hamas is a terrorist group in the worst sense of the word insofar as it will throw anybody and anything in front of its desire for a victory in whatever part of the world it wishes to exist at any time.  I have absolutely no time for Hamas and what it does.  I ask the UN Security Council where Hamas is getting its weapons.  There are images of Palestine in bits and these people have tens of millions of euro in weapons for use against Israel.<\/p> <p>  I also state at this time that Ireland has now re-established what I would call good old-fashioned relationships with the United States so we are in a better position than we ever have been.  In Ireland, we lived with terrorism for 40 years and my own family suffered threats from terrorism.  I served in two armies and I know what it is like to be on the ground.<\/p> <p>  No war against terrorism can be won in the air and the likes of Hamas cannot be fought in the air.  Hamas is fully aware of the fact that when Israel sends rockets and jets to fire missiles in order to take out Hamas, civilians will also be taken out.  I am looking at reports now of 69 people killed, 17 of whom were children, and 390 people wounded, 86 of whom were children and 39 of whom were women.  No one side is responsible for this and no matter how much we might want, on either side of the argument, to clap ourselves on the back and say \"it was not our fault\", it is everybody's fault.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador is the most honourable man I have met in this country and his desire to represent his state is commendable.  I ask him if he is willing to go back to Israel and remind his government that the Irish people are his friends.  The Irish people have learned that one cannot win a terrorist war so one must work for peace.  It would be the most noble act for Israel to withdraw now from conflict; one side can call a truce and step back from the brink.  I ask that Israel does that.<\/p> <p>  The representations today were robust and I understand that willingness to defend the actions of people that we care for.  Deputy Brady showed some photographs of children and they should never be the victims in war.  I abhor war and hate everything about it.  I ask the witnesses to use their good offices to negotiate for peace at all levels.  I understand the annoyance and frustration felt by the witnesses when they hear Palestine represented in Ireland, as it is like no other side exists sometimes.  The Hamas group must be taken out.<\/p> <p>  Israel has one of the best-trained armies in the world and it should be possible to be far more focused in taking out those who threaten its country.  The people of Palestine have suffered but as has been pointed out in the submissions, I cannot imagine what it would be like to go to bed in Tel Aviv or some part of Israel tonight knowing that rockets are being fired indiscriminately into places of safety.  A home should be a safe place.<\/p> <p>  I am not taking sides but I understand both sides and the fear of people living in Israel with the threat of terrorism hanging over them.  I wish the people of Palestine would see that issue with Hamas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#K00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I am addressing the ambassador and the supporters of the Israeli project, state or whatever it is.  I am one of the people who think that state is a colonialist enterprise and that it is an apartheid state.  From its very beginning, it achieved its aims through the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people, something well documented by Professor Illan Papp&eacute; in his book, <i>The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine<\/i>, which indicates that between 1947 and 1948, 700,000 to 900,000 Palestinians - innocent people - were driven from their homes in less than a year.  They were driven from homes in villages and towns.<\/p><p>Some of those people were driven to places like Sheikh Jarrah, which is now at the centre of another attempt at ethnic cleansing by the Israeli state as it continues its advance to displace Palestinian people and take control of territory designated under the UN partition plan that has been mentioned as Palestinian territory.  That territory is within the green line and designated as Palestinian territory.  Israel continues to annex that territory, achieving that through the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.  Violence is used along with a twisted version of the law as the means to achieve those aims.<\/p><p>If my narrative is not true, please explain the basic law of the Israeli state, which is an apartheid law and which establishes supremacy for people of Jewish origin, establishing the state as a Jewish state.  Therefore, the 20% of inhabitants that are Palestinian are deemed, from a legal perspective, as second class citizens.  They are not on the same level as the Jewish population or treated as such.<\/p><p>Furthermore, if what I say is not true, will Israel allow all of the Palestinians and their descendants displaced in 1947 and 1948 to return to their homes and villages, as international law demands?  If, as Israel claims, the 600,000 to 700,000 settlers who have established themselves contrary to international law, contrary to the demands of Oslo and contrary to the appeals of the international community are really just about establishing Jewish settlements and Israel subsequently intends to hand over that territory for a Palestinian state, surely there is a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for all the, probably now, 4 million or 5 million people and their descendants, many of whom are living in refugee camps in Lebanon and Syria in the most desperate conditions and completely disenfranchised.  Surely, if Israel believes that Jew, Arab and Christian and indeed people of no religion, which by the way I certainly do, can and should live side by side with equal rights, then grant all those Palestinians and their descendants the right to return.  Then Israel's Orwellian narrative of trying to justify the continued annexation and ethnic cleansing of Palestinian territory might have some credibility.  Unless Israel actually confers equality in the basic laws of the state, whether one calls it Israel or Palestine, it is a fact that the ambassador's state is an apartheid state and it is a fact that it confers rights and privileges on one group because of its religion and nationality which it denies to others.  If I am wrong, let the ambassador tell us now that Palestinians will have the right to return to their homes and villages and that they will have equality.  Of course, the ambassador will not concede that.  There is no chance the ambassador will concede that.<br\/><br\/>For us to say that is not in any sense, by the way, as Israel often charges, motivated by anti-Semitism.  As I told one of the ambassador's predecessors, I lived in the Negev, in a moshav.  I went there completely without prejudice.  In fact, if anything, my prejudice was very much one of sympathy, as I still hold, for the historic plight of the Jews and the persecution they faced.  When I lived there, I worked side by side with Palestinians who I met in the first few days who were living in refugee camps and who had been displaced.  They and their families had been displaced in 1947 and 1948 and had lived in refugee camps ever since.  I saw the horrific treatment of those people, the endemic racism, the anti-Arab racism that is rife - rife - in mainstream Israeli society, the systematic discrimination and the fundamental denial of the right of the Palestinian families I met living refugee camps to be able to return to the towns and villages from which they were displaced using terror by Zionist militias in 1947 and 1948, using atrocities such as Deir Yassin where 200 people were murdered in their beds and the screams of those who were killed were broadcast in order to terrorise other Palestinians into leaving their home, as nearly 1 million did over a year.  If I am wrong, let Israel give the Palestinians the right to return.  Then Israel can show it is serious about peace and then, maybe, have some sort of peaceful negotiation.  Israel should stop trying to drive people out of places in which they live now, including Sheikh Jarrah.

There was a couple of questions directly put to me.  I listened carefully to the contributions, particularly what I would describe as the toxic contributions from Deputies Brady and Boyd Barrett which are regrettable.  They included nothing positive to contribute to a peaceful resolution and will do nothing to benefit the welfare of Palestinians or to end conflict.  I have heard the same speech for many years delivered by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Deputy Brady regularly produces the type of commentary I heard this morning in the toxic tweets that he engages in.  Let me deal with the particular questions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked me do I believe that Israelis and Palestinians should be treated as equals.  I have a simple answer to that.  The answer to that is, \"Yes\".  I believe that Israelis and Palestinians should be treated as equal.  I would like to see the implementation of a viable two-state solution.  I would like to see Hamas ceasing to be a terrorist organisation that oppresses Palestinians.<\/p> <p>  It is noteworthy that not a single contributor who is critical of Israel referenced the oppressive nature of the Hamas regime in Gaza, the arrest by Hamas of Gazan peace activists, their imprisonment for daring to talk peace to Israelis, the persecution of the gay community in Gaza and the threats Hamas issues to those who may take to protest on the streets in Gaza against Hamas.  There is a selective concern on the part of Deputies Brady and Boyd Barrett in particular for the welfare of Palestinians.  I have stood in Gaza following one of the conflicts talking to business people who before conflict had provided products, both to the people of Gaza and exports into Israel, who were terrified to publicly express their views but who wanted nothing but peace, wanted to restore their businesses and who were complaining about the corruption within Hamas in exploiting the tunnels to charge people tax to bring in product that they could not otherwise get because some of these products the Israelis were not allowing in because they were used to build weapons or tunnels.<\/p> <p>  I said what I heard on Tuesday was depressing.  What I have heard today is no less depressing because this is not about implementing a two-state solution or a peace process.  What this is solely focused on is something that Deputy Brady's party and, indeed, Deputy Boyd Barrett and some others have been engaged in for many years which is a campaign to de-legitimise and demonise the Israeli state.  Ironically, Sinn F&eacute;in, that advocates the self-determination of the Irish people, is apparently entirely opposed to the self-determination of the Jewish people and both Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Brady strenuously seek to avoid the reality that the UN resolution of 1947 envisaged the creation of Israel as a Jewish state, the one and only Jewish state in the world that has 52 Muslim states, and in a world in which many of those states exclude other religions and do not display the level of religious tolerance and understanding that applies in Israel to all of those who want to say prayers or worship within their own religions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Gannon put a question to me about some election video by Mr. Benny Gantz in 2018 being the provocation that has produced the current conflict.  There are moments in time when propositions presented are so ludicrous that one really has to step back.  One of the depressing things on Tuesday was no reference at all at any stage in a single question put to a single speaker to the then 800 rockets that had been fired into Israel.  As we stand this morning, there have been in excess of 1,300 rockets indiscriminately fired into Israel.  What it appears some members of the committee, including Deputy Brady, are advocating is that Israel has no right to defend itself, that Jewish people have no right to defend themselves, that the Israeli Government has no right to defend all the citizens of Israel, be they Jews, Christians or Muslims, and that, simply, it is open season for Hamas to fire as many rockets as it wishes and to rely on Iranian expertise and finance to process that.<\/p><p>I reject that as a proposition.  If I could say to Deputy Brady, who spoke at some length, one of the big tragedies is that Sinn F&eacute;in has learned nothing from the peace process.  Sinn F&eacute;in as a party, through its militant proxies in the Provisional IRA, was engaged in death and mayhem on this island for 30 years.  We eventually had the Good Friday Agreement which John Hume described as Sunningdale for slow learners.  What was learned was the need to understand the background to conflicts in their totality and the different understandings of those engaged in conflict who disagree.  Sinn F&eacute;in has something it could offer to those engaged in militant terrorism, namely, explaining the importance of ending violence, talking, people learning to live with each other and understand each other, and creating trust and moving to reconciliation.  What Sinn F&eacute;in, in the context of Deputy Brady and other members of his party who regularly tweet do, including Deputy Andrews who has tweeted regularly the words \"From the river to the sea\"-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021051300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Shatter","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Sorry, Chair, it is not appropriate for someone to call the questioning of human rights abuses toxic.

As I also mentioned in my opening remarks, a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians is in the vital interest of both sides.  That should be understood and internalised.  It is very difficult.  Unfortunately, during the last few years, we have seen the Palestinians avoiding going back to negotiating table.  As for the prospects for a solution, Israel has shown before that it is prepared to go very far and pay a very dear price when real peace is on the agenda.  We saw that in the peace agreement with Egypt and the huge territories that we gave back, including the uprooting of Israeli communities in the Sinai at the time and we saw it in Gaza where we unilaterally evacuated some 10,000 Israeli civilians there and uprooted whole communities.  We are willing to go very far to reach a sustainable and final agreement with the Palestinians that will enable both peoples to live in safety and security and, at the same time, fulfil their wishes and desires.  This is not easily achieved.<\/p> <p>  Some of the contributions we heard from committee members can work constructively towards this end.  On the other hand, we heard some spats of hate - I am sorry for the wording.  I do not know what they aspire to achieve.  We discussed how Ireland can contribute to a solution or progress.  While some contributions and attitudes expressed today were constructive to that end, others were totally destructive.  As I said, and Mr. Shatter also mentioned, it is sometimes very surprising and disappointing to hear such attitudes coming out of Ireland, of all places, where people have some painful experience of dealing with such complex conflicts.<\/p> <p>  The bottom line is that I think hope is there.  There is no other choice but hope for a solution between Israelis and Palestinians.  Israel will continue to do its utmost.  At the same time, maybe to the disappointment of some members, Israel will continue to preserve its interests and defend its citizens.  It is important that I emphasise again that we are working within international law and according to international law.  There might be disagreements around it but this is one of the major principles we are following.  <\/p> <p>  I ask for the Chair's guidance on whether there are any other specific points he would like me to answer in the very short time that I understand we have.

I thank the select committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today.  I welcome the opportunity to present this legislation to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill, I would like to emphasise that it is a key enabler for the new public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, and allows for a range of reforming pay matters, including implementation of aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Over the period since March 2020, the public service has stepped up to the challenge of the Covid-19 crisis and has delivered a world-class response.  Public servants have adapted and readjusted the way in which services are delivered so as to minimise the negative impact of the pandemic on the public.<\/p> <p>  In that regard, Building Momentum recognises the value of the work of our public servants during this pandemic and provides for affordable increases with pay adjustments weighted toward those on lower incomes.  The agreement also sets out a reform agenda.  Each sector will produce and publish reform plans that will demonstrate delivery each year and payment of a 1% sectoral fund will be conditional on the delivery of actual reforms.<\/p> <p>  As noted, the Bill will also enable progress on a range of pay reform matters, including Sl&aacute;intecare.  A key objective of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation process is to remove consultant private practice from public hospitals.  Central to implementation of this reform is a move to public-only consultant contracts and to tailor that contract to align with wider Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.<\/p><p>The new contract, noting the significant reforms involved, is to offer an increased pay level.  A consultation process with the medical unions on the new contract has commenced.  Members will have heard the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, speak about that earlier this week.<\/p><p> These measures, which support reform, recruitment and retention in particular areas of our public service, cannot be progressed to payment under existing FEMPI Acts.  This underscores the need for this amending legislation.  In summary terms, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provides that no change can be made in the pay of a public servant without legislative amendment, a court order or a determination that there is a legal entitlement to a pay increase.  While it is possible to set a pay rate for a new grade or post, it is not possible to change the pay of an existing public servant in post.  This Bill, therefore, provides for amendment of those restrictions on increases to public service pay introduced by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.<\/p><p> I will now outline the details of the legislation.  Section 1 sets out a definition of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 as the \"Act of 2009\".  Section 2 amends section 4 of the Act of 2009 to provide that in addition to changes to pay arising from an Act of the Oireachtas, an order of the civil courts, an order of the Labour Court or a determination that there is a legal entitlement to a pay increase, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may sanction increases in the pay or allowances of public servants.<\/p><p> Section 3 amends section 5 of the Act of 2009 to provide for retrospective application, up to the date on which this proposed Act is enacted, of a provision allowing for amendment of contracts of employment to increase pay.  Section 4 amends section 16A of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 2011 to ensure that where a contract of employment is amended in accordance with section 4 of the Act of 2009, as amended by this proposed Act, no further ministerial sanction is required under the Ministers and Secretaries Act 2011.  Section 5 provides that the Short Title of the proposed Act is the Public Service Pay Act 2020.<\/p><p> Prior to this Committee Stage consideration, section 5 of the Bill provided for amendment of section 24(3) of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 to align the date for repeal of section 5(1) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 with the date on which this proposed Act is enacted.  However, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provided for the repeal of section 5(1) of the 2009 Act on 1 January 2021.  Section 5 had been included on the basis that the Bill was drafted and published in 2020, in advance of the date of 1 January 2021 and to avoid inconsistency in the removal of restrictions on pay.<\/p><p> Noting that arising from the passage of time, section 5(1) was repealed on 1 January 2021, this element of the Bill is moot and an amendment is proposed to remove same, remove a reference to the 2017 Act in the Long Title and renumber the Bill accordingly.  It is a purely technical amendment which we can discuss when we come to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#A00500","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I will allow opening remarks from any members of the committee who wish to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#B00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as teacht os comhair na coiste seo.

We are reverting to a more normal era of industrial relations and hopefully agreeing pay deals into the future.  It is in the interests of all concerned if we can do it in an orderly way and give public servants certainty about their own pay.

We have introduced reforms that will come into effect in the period ahead whereby we are bringing in a major projects advisory group to support the work of my Department.  We will also be advertising shortly in an open public competition for external members to join the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board so that they can complement the skills and experience of the Secretaries General who are currently serving on that board.  We have updated the public spending code in recent times to strengthen the oversight of public spending.  It is not always about the quantum.  The quantum is important and will be ambitious.  It will be confirmed in the new national development plan that we will publish in July.  We will lay out what each Department will be getting for the next five years and, in addition, what the overall amount is out to 2030.<\/p> <p>  We will see a re-prioritisation in line with the programme for Government.  That is appropriate because we are publishing a climate action plan shortly.  We have the legislation before the House at this time.  Binding five-year rolling carbon budgets are being introduced.  We have to ensure all Government policy is pointing towards the achievement of those overall objectives.  There is a great deal of work ahead but I am pleased with the progress we are making in respect of the review of the NDP.  I know this is an issue the Deputy has taken a keen interest in and I welcome that.  I hope that over the course of June we can complete the content and agree on what the ceilings are for the coming years.  I am satisfied that it will match the ambition the IMF has called on us to meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#C00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>While we are at an all-time high now in terms of capital expenditure, the reality is that we were lagging so far behind and we have had a significant infrastructural deficit in this State for so long.

It is of deep concern for people.  It relates to the pandemic unemployment payment and business supports.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have said there will be no cliff edge.  The Minister has also said that we will know the outline in the coming weeks.  There is, however, a problem for businesses.  I have been speaking to the people involved.  They do not have the luxury of waiting for several weeks to see what will happen.  They are concerned.  Businesses, including hotels and so on have to plan for the coming year.  People need to know whether they can pay the rent or mortgage next month.  It is of deep concern to people.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister provide more clarity?  Can he provide assurance to people that this will go on longer term?  Does the Minister see this going on?  The Minister says there will be no cliff edge and is talking about tapering off.

As committee members know, under the 2017 Act the pathway for the unwinding of FEMPI cuts was laid out.  There are complexities but in simple terms people earning up to &euro;70,000 at this point have had full restoration.  Those earning between &euro;70,000 and &euro;150,000 under the 2017 Act are to have restoration by July this year.  Then the remainder of the FEMPI tail, as it is called, is to be dealt with in 2022.  I can provide further detail on those issues if committee members wish.<\/p> <p>  One issue I have been looking at is the overall need for retention of the FEMPI legislation given that we are now in the process of unwinding the reductions imposed under the FEMPI Acts.  Some provisions in the FEMPI Acts will now become defunct but other provisions are still valid and needed.  These relate to a legal basis for the benefits of the public service agreements up to 2020, a legal basis for pay restoration to continue to 1 July 2022 and several definitions in the FEMPI Acts relating to public servants, public bodies and so on.  I can provide a more technical briefing on that point if people wish.  In broad terms we are well down the road of unwinding the FEMPI cuts.  It has been completed for those up to &euro;70,000.  We regard those above that level as the FEMPI tail.<\/p><p>The Act lays out what needs to be done in 2021 and 2022.  They are issues on which I have been engaging with the Attorney General in regard to legal advice and so on.  There will be further restoration later this year in respect of the FEMPI.<\/p><p> On infrastructure, we will look right across the span of Departments and sectors.  As I signalled earlier, the core priorities will be housing, climate action, transport, education and health.  All the areas will be dealt with as part of the NDP review.  We will give Departments certainty as to their budgets for the next five years because it takes time to plan the delivery of projects through the pipeline.  We will then lay out the overall capital budget for each year beyond that, that is, for the second half of the new ten-year plan.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Farrell in regard to the continuation of the supports, the position remains as we have outlined.  We are working through the detail and examining different scenarios.  We expect to come to a conclusion in the next two to three weeks and will then lay out the plan for the supports beyond the end of June.  I restate there will be no cliff edge or abrupt end.  We are deeply conscious of the importance of those supports for people who remain unemployed because of the pandemic.  For many of them, their jobs will not have come back by the end of June and I have said publicly we will have to take account of that.  Not every sector will have had an opportunity to reopen fully, so we are conscious of how vital that form of income is for people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own.<\/p><p> Equally, on the issue of the business supports, there are decisions to be made on the employment wage subsidy scheme, the local authority rates waiver and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  The third issue will kind of work itself out, depending on whether businesses will be allowed to open.  The key one is the employment wage subsidy scheme, which is supporting the employment of more than 300,000 people.  It comes at a cost, of close to &euro;400 million a month, but we need to be very careful in the changes we make because we do not want to result in people moving from the wage subsidy scheme to the PUP.  We believe the retention of the connection between employer and employee is vital.  The scheme has been a lifesaver and will have a role to play into the future.  Any changes we will need to make will be laid out in the next two to three weeks.<\/p><p> In overall terms, these supports are temporary in nature.  We cannot continue indefinitely with emergency-level expenditure.  The stability programme update, on a technical basis, sets out the full unwinding of Covid-related spending by the end of next year, but it will be for the Government to make decisions in the weeks ahead that take account of all the issues the Deputy raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#C00600","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I am conscious we are here to debate Committee Stage, with one amendment proposed to the Bill, but as the Vice Chairman said, it is an opportunity to discuss the national development plan and, to a greater extent, infrastructural investment over the coming years.  I am glad to hear the Minister outline areas such as public transport, health and housing.  The retrofitting of houses will create significant long-term employment and investment in such areas, not to mention offshore renewable which has potential for the creation of jobs through electrifying transport and how we heat our houses.  There are good long-term prospects for sustainable and clean jobs, which is really good, and there is a high-multiplier effect from investing money wisely in that.  The Minister will recall that when he appeared previously before the committee, he mentioned the European recovery and resilience fund but we did not have an opportunity at that stage to discuss it.  That fund will have a very positive impact.  He covered much of the infrastructural investment and we are all aware of where we would like that to go.<\/p> <p>  Digitisation is also a part of that recovery fund and will be very important.  We have seen the reliance on the digital communications in the country and where the deficits are.  People who have been working from home have struggled in cases where they do not have good communications infrastructure, such as Wi-Fi, broadband and so on.  I met representatives of National Broadband Ireland recently and am quite impressed by the fibre-to-door design being rolled out.  There is no limit on fibre.  The limit is the receivers and transmitters and they are always upgradable.  Fibre-to-door is a decades-long investment that will really pay back.<\/p> <p>  In many urban areas where we thought there was high-speed broadband, excessive loads were experienced during the day when everybody was working from home.  There were digital patches and blackspots in urban areas and contention on the line where it was not the single fibre to the door that everybody has.  That is an area we need to prioritise.  Obviously, rural broadband has been left behind for many years and I fully support accelerating the roll-out of that to everybody, but there is work to be done in many of the urban centres too.  I hope part of the recovery and resilience fund will be used for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021051300002#D00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I strongly agree with the Deputy's sentiments on the importance of issues such as retrofitting.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that a large share of the proceeds we get from increases in carbon tax to 2030 will be ring-fenced for that purpose.  I have been working closely with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to get the infrastructure right.  For example, we greatly enhanced the capacity of the SEAI in decisions we made in the most recent budget because it will be a significant undertaking to achieve the critical mass of coverage that we need in retrofitting.  That will be an important part of the new national development plan.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy touched on public transport.  It goes without saying that will be vital in the new NDP.  I agree there is considerable potential in the area of offshore renewables.  The new marine planning Bill and the new marine framework being introduced are critical.  We need to modernise the regulatory, approval and licensing regime that governs that area to ensure that projects can commence and get through the various stages because it takes too long at present.  I look forward to seeing the progression of that Bill through the Oireachtas as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  On the recovery and resilience plan, we are in the final stages of our engagement with the European Commission and expect to lodge the formal plan very soon.  It involves a range of exciting projects, in both the green transition space and digitisation.  There has been much progress in the past year or so in the provision of public services online and there will be further investment in that area.  We have been working closely with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer on projects that can be delivered through the national recovery and resilience plan.  We will receive grants, in today's value terms, of about &euro;915 million over this year and next year and it will have to involve a balance of investments and reforms.  We are at a very advanced stage.  The Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner Dombrovskis, wrote to me recently commending Ireland on the work we are doing and encouraged us to continue to work with the Commission.  I expect we will submit that plan soon and, once it has been formally approved, it will involve the release of significant funding that will allow us to support some really exciting projects in further and higher education, digitisation, transport, retrofitting and a range of environmental measures.

As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  Opening statements will be limited to three minutes each, if possible.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I will not permit a member to attend where he or she is not adhering to the constitutional requirements.  Therefore, any member who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report and to mute their microphones when not making a statement to reduce background noise and feedback.

I am joined by Ms Fiona Jennings, ISPCC's senior policy and public affairs manager.  We will both be happy to address any questions members might have on our opening statement or written submission as the session proceeds.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC's sole concern with this legislation and the reason we are here is to ensure the protection of children online and to impress on members, as legislators, that this is within their gift.  The ISPCC views itself as a child-centred technology advocate.  It champions all the benefits technology has, highlights and educates on the potential risks and harms, and speaks out about the gaps in the current regulatory approach. <\/p> <p>  Through our suite of Childline services, children and young people tell us at first-hand about the experiences of their daily lives.  In the ISPCC's last operational year, the Childline telephone services received more than 265,000 contacts, of which we answered in excess of 206,000.  Our Childline text and online service received nearly 35,000 contacts.  Online safety and bullying, including cyberbullying and the impact it can have on children's mental health, featured across these services.<\/p> <p>  Today, I want to share the story of just one child.  I want to demonstrate the real human impact of online harm and why access to effective and efficient remedies is crucial and warrants meaningful policy and legislative change, which could, in some cases, be life-saving.  The child's story reflects the weekly interactions we have with children and young people and why cyberbullying is an issue that we must all take seriously.  Kate is 13 years old.  Her interests include gaming, hanging out with her friends, playing the piano and enjoying all the typical things a 13-year-old girl ought to enjoy.  She enjoys posting videos of her piano-playing online, competing with her friends through online gaming, and using various apps to keep in touch with what is going on in their busy daily lives.  At least she used to enjoy these activities but things changed recently for her.  The in-school bullying she was enduring moved online, where lies were being spread about her by her so-called friends.  Students were texting and calling her horrible names on the very apps on which they once enjoyed hanging out together.  She sits alone in her bedroom, but not in silence.  She is kept company by the constant pinging of her phone alerting her to the latest horrible thing being said about her.<\/p> <p>  When Kate contacted Childline, she told the call facilitator how she wanted to slit her wrists as she felt this was the only way to stop the cyberbullying.  Imagine being in the shoes of Kate, a child who felt this was the only option that would make her situation better.  She blocked some of the children who were saying horrible things about her and reported some of them to the various platforms and gaming sites she was being bullied on but nothing meaningful happened and the cyberbullying continued.  <\/p> <p>  Cyberbullying can have a long-lasting and devastating impact on its victims.  By its nature, it is intentional, targeted, repeated and persistent.  Whereas in the past some victims of bullying had a reprieve at weekends and school holidays, it is no longer the case when bullying moves online.  It is likely that each example of cyberbullying that Kate endured, if reported in isolation, would not meet the investigation threshold of any platform or site.  However, when considered together, the picture is very clear.  The impact on Kate is very clear.  It is in respect of cases like hers, a case of egregious cyberbullying, that the ISPCC impresses upon the committee the need for some mechanism to be available to children.  A reporting mechanism that children such as Kate could avail of would go some way to rectifying the problem and limit the harm being caused.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC was impressed to hear the representatives of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, the future regulators in this space, state at last week's committee meeting that the protection of minors is central to the body's plans and efforts, while recognising that in a small number of circumstances there may not be the potential to resolve an issue effectively and efficiently within the provisions of the proposed Bill.  It was further heartening to hear the witnesses from the BAI and the Data Protection Commission, DPC, calling on the committee to reconsider including a notice and take-down function under the remit of the online safety commissioner, seeing merit in such an individual complaints function. <\/p> <p>  There is a need for society to shift the narrative in how we speak about bullying behaviour.  It is not banter, it is not a rite of passage, and it is not \"just having the craic\" where someone is deliberately and persistently being targeted over and over.  We need to recognise it for what it is, namely behaviour that can cause long-lasting harm.  Our one ask of the committee is that it reconsider the concept of the notice and take-down provision as set out in a draft Bill purposed by the Law Reform Commission, LRC, in 2016.<\/p><p>In the most egregious cases of cyberbullying, children must have access to an individual complaints mechanism.  While we appreciate there is now an urgency in getting this legislation passed due to the need to transpose the audiovisual media services directive, we ask the committee not to fall at the final hurdle and to remain committed to the protection of children online at this critical juncture.  We look forward to any questions committee members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Church for the very powerful statement he has made.

There are three issues we wanted to raise with the committee with regard to the Bill.  The first relates to the naming of the online safety commissioner in the legislation.  The legislation talks about appointing commissioners.  I understand the Government's position is that the Bill does not say there should be an online safety commissioner because it wants the flexibility to appoint additional commissioners in the future if there is a demand.  However, you could also consider the reverse.  What if a future government decides it does not want to have an online safety commissioner?  What if there were two online safety commissioners and a government decided to get rid of one of them?  This is something about which we are concerned.  We feel there is no real reason the legislation could not be amended to state that there will be at least one online safety commissioner.  That would be a very important amendment and the Oireachtas needs to accept it.<\/p> <p>  The committee has heard from many organisations and stakeholders with regard to the individual complaints mechanism.  I cannot emphasise enough how absolutely important this is.  This online safety legislation will have failed if it does not include an independent individual mechanism for children and young people.  They are up against the big, wealth technology giants that control the majority of these platforms and do not invest enough in safety-proofing or in privacy measures.  The emphasis should obviously be on making these platforms process cases in a timely and effective fashion.  We are concerned that, without some independent mechanism, children will not have a right to a remedy.  This is something provided for in law.  A common or typical case about which we would hear from our members might involve a nine-year-old or a ten-year-old posting content that is harmful to them while a child and then getting bullied about it later in life.  It might otherwise involve other children or young people posting content that is harmful to them, on which basis they get bullied.  As we have heard time and again, these platforms are very slow and inconsistent in taking this kind of content down.<\/p> <p>  The last issue I will raise with the committee relates to the area of education.  Members will know that children who are vulnerable offline are very vulnerable online.  Most children do not have an adult at their shoulder when they are online.  That is just the reality of the situation.  What do we do?  We have to make the Internet a safer place for them.  We have to regulate it.  The other thing we need to do is to focus on empowering and educating children to protect themselves online.<\/p> <p>  One of our concerns, which has come up through our member organisations, relates to the lack of consistency in online education in our schools and youth settings throughout the country.  There needs to be a core curriculum, stipulated by the online safety commissioner.  The commissioner should have a role in regulating and registering those who deliver this type of education to children and young people.  It is only in this way that we can be sure that children are getting the toolkit they need to keep themselves safe online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ward.

CyberSafeKids is an Irish charity set up in 2015 with the aim of equipping children with the skills and knowledge to embrace the many opportunities for learning and enjoyment technology can deliver while avoiding the inherent risks they face in the online world such as cyberbullying, exposure to harmful content and online grooming.<\/p> <p>  We fully support the introduction of legislation that will change the landscape in Ireland with regard to online safety in general and particularly with regard to children, who are among the most vulnerable online users.  We welcome the idea there will be an online safety commissioner with both the powers and the resources to make a difference if those powers and resources are well defined.  The commissioner must be explicitly named in the Bill, however, so that the intention to create that post is made both clear and specific.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the proposal to have a central point of contact for a broad range of online safety matters and the fact this role will have oversight over education and public awareness, both of which are key strategies in equipping online users with the skills and knowledge to make informed decisions in the online space.  We want to see the regulator&rsquo;s powers further extended to include oversight and the powers to accredit online safety education programmes throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons we are here today is we all know self-regulation does not work.  No other industry that wields such power and influence is left to self-regulate in the same way.  This legislation needs to be meaningful and it must be effective.  Our concern is that the stated desire to bring about systemic change will all take years to effect real change and that only dealing with super-complaints will not make a real difference to ordinary people&rsquo;s lives.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to the part of this Bill that is lacking, that is, an individual complaints mechanism.  It is essential such a service be available to Irish children and their guardians and that the law provide a vital safety net at a critical time.  If children are being bullied or harassed online, and if they or their guardians have tried and failed to get this content removed from the online services in question, then there must be scope for them to access support and remedial action in a timely fashion.<\/p> <p>  Let me provide an example.  Last year, a teacher from a secondary school in Ireland reached out to us over concern about a 14-year-old boy in her class.  He had recently moved to the school after being severely bullied in his previous school.  The bullying was over some videos this boy had posted on a video sharing platform when he was much younger.  When it had first happened, his mother promised to get those videos down by the time her son woke up the next morning.  Unfortunately, despite her best efforts, she simply could not do it as he had lost his login details and she found no way around it.  She reached out to the platform in question but it said the videos did not violate its community standards so it could not help.  The videos stayed up for two years.  The boy moved schools but became increasingly distraught about his new classmates finding this content and it all starting again.  His teacher asked if we could help.  We contacted the online service in question and argued the boy was under the minimum age restriction of 13 when he posted the videos.  It took a bit of back and forth but all traces were removed ten days after we contacted the platform.<\/p> <p>  Imagine if that family had the option open to them at the time to take their case to an independent regulator who had the power to issue a time-bound takedown notice.  It might have saved two years of living with the threat of someone seeing those videos and the worry of what he or she might say.  It might have saved this boy having to move schools.  Just to be clear, an individual complaints mechanism should not deal with every single case that arises.  This is about putting in place an effective triage system so that it would be those cases, and only those cases, in respect of which all available channels with the relevant online service provider had been exhausted that would be dealt with.  If this service would need to be for the whole of Europe, then it would need to be resourced accordingly with European money as well the proposed levy to be provided by the online services themselves.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for providing the opportunity to comment on this Bill, which has the potential to change the landscape with regard to online safety in Ireland if we get it right.

I strongly agree with the testimony of the witnesses and with their view that we need specifically to name the online safety commissioner in the Bill and to resource the office properly.

We in the ISPCC have a number of children advisory committees.  We get 800 to 1,000 contacts from children every day.  While that is many children and a mini omnibus in itself, we still like to have qualitative input from children.  Through the ISPCC and other organisations, there would be a good opportunity to set something up formally.  We would be happy to facilitate that.  That would be my thinking on the first question.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's statement about community standards and the platforms, we interact with all the platforms.  We have an open, transparent relationship.  We were talking to Facebook this week and know it will be at the committee next week.  While what it is putting in place is admirable to some degree, with various tools and software to prevent this, one only has to look at the number of images and harmful content that it takes down regularly to tell one how big it is.  If there was a question that the committee wanted to probe with it, it would be the aspect of shareholder value versus the protection of the child.  Our concern in the ISPCC is that one is traded off against the other.  We have quarterly meetings with such companies as Facebook, TikTok, etc.  While super things are happening and the investment is admirable, it is nowhere near what it should be doing.  We in the ISPCC believe that one cannot trade one off against the others.<\/p> <p>  There is a serious issue with end-to-end encryption.  I do not know if the committee is aware of this but companies are all looking at implementing end-to-end encryption to protect privacy.  That may unwittingly protect the perpetrators online.  \"Online trading\" is a terrible term to use but online trading of child sexual abuse materials is a big business.  I would like to see the platforms be able to do both.  We landed a helicopter on Mars.  Surely we can protect children at the same time as providing privacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut Mr. Church short.

What do the witnesses think that social media platforms need to do in that regard, especially for children?  Do they think that social media need to adopt child-friendly versions of their platforms with additional protections?  I am not clear on the answer myself.

There are two parts to that question.  Do the witnesses have international examples of either a reporting mechanism which has been deployed or what other countries have done, which we are doing our own research on?

We should make them accountable for allowing children and young people to access that content.  If one goes outside the front door, someone there is responsible.  Children should have the same experience but some things should be off-limits to them.<\/p> <p>  We talk about special platforms for children and young people.  When those things are created, it is a new product for children and young people.  If there is a chance to meet with these companies, one should raise the profiling and targeting that they are engaging in with children and young people when it comes to advertising.  Children and young people are impressionable and it is having a significant effect on many situations, especially with regard to alcohol and junk food.

With regard to resources for children, the Council of Europe has developed some great guidelines on children in the digital environment, which take into account both children's rights online and the need to empower them to be online, and also what to do with regard to remedies, fair procedure rights and their protection rights.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recently developed a general comment.  That was done in consultation with children and young people.  It was published earlier this month.

There is an urgency for the transposition of the audiovisual media services directive and, in terms of splitting it, then to remove the national legislative proposal, the online safety commissioner, which we are discussing today.  We have major concerns about that.  We have been campaigning for this for some time and we feel there is a great deal of good in the current proposal.  However, the glaring absence, and we are making this point today and it has been made previously at committee meetings, is the lack of an individual complaints mechanism.  We are informed by officials that they are having conversations with the EU Commission and they appear to be confident that it is aligning with what the Digital Services Act is proposing.  The Digital Services Act proposes a much more robust complaints mechanism.  If they are to align and there is minimum disruption when the Digital Services Act comes into place, we probably need to pay a little more attention to that.  We certainly ask the committee to pay more attention to what is happening in that regard as well.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Garda and resourcing for the Bill, briefly, we know that criminal content will not be a significant aspect of the Bill.

The problem is when things go sour.  The question is the extent of regulation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the protection of children's rights.  As we saw last week with the children from Kinsale and Tallaght who gave testimony to the committee, they expressed concern about over-regulation of the area.  It comes down to the fine lines.  I refer to the point Ms Ward made.  Obviously, there are identifiable threats in terms of pornography and other issues, but she also spoke about the targeted advertisements by cosmetics companies, especially at young girls, which in many cases can be equally destructive to their self-image and self-worth, and can equally lead down a harmful path.  Where do we draw the line in these areas of fine lines as to what is material that can be very harmful to young children?  This point was made yesterday by the special rapporteur on child protection regarding harmful online content, its dissemination and its identification.  It might be easily identifiable with things such as pornography, but it is not as easily identifiable in a swathe of other areas and is equally destructive.  What are witnesses' thoughts on how that can be addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#D01500","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I saw the testimony of the young people from Tallaght and Kinsale.

However, we need to regulate for the right things.  That is my first comment.  In that respect, education has a massive role to play.<\/p> <p>  When we talk in the ISPCC about the different types of harm we find the four Cs very useful: content, where the child is a recipient; contact, where the child is a participant; conduct, where the child is an actor; and contract, a new one that has been updated.  The special rapporteur touched on the latter yesterday in respect of online gambling.  There is a plethora of online harms so the first question we must ask ourselves is what we want to regulate and what needs to be regulated versus where education plays a role in this as well.  We all are online now, we are a lot more proficient online and our lives have moved online.<\/p><p>Adults as well as children and young people need to have a better understanding as to how content is served up, how we can manage that and how we can protect our privacy online.

On what an individual complaints mechanism should look like, it should, first of all, go to the platform.  If the child has a problem, he or she should first go to what would the local complaint platform would be.  Whatever platform it is, one should go to the local platform and make the complaint there.  If one is not happy with the result, it has not taken it seriously or it has not done anything about it, then one would make the complaint to the online safety commissioner.  That is how we would see it happening.  There would be two tiers and, effectively, the online safety commissioner would be a safety net for when the platforms do not do their job.  It would not be that everyone with a problem would go straight to the commissioner.  It would be if they do not get the result from the platform.<\/p> <p>  In order for it to be child friendly, it would need to be prompt, it would need to be accessible and it would need to provide information that children and families can understand to access the complaints mechanisms.  What we should be doing is putting it back on the technology platforms that their complaints mechanisms are effective in the first instance.  That is what the online safety commission should also have a role in doing - making sure that they do it right first and then only that which is most egregious comes to the online safety commission.  An example that the committee could look at would be something like the Ombudsman for Children where people have to make a complaint to the person first and then go to the Ombudsman for Children who sees whether it meets a certain threshold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie Ahern"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ahern.

There is a very important point, following on from Ms Ahern there.  I note the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has been before the committee.  We have interacted with the BAI and one of the major concerns here is the scale of being able to handle complaints.  There is a fear, which, in my view, is a myth, that they will be inundated with complaints and they will not be able to handle it.  The population of Europe is 750 million and 450 million people are online.  If one starts with numbers like that, it scares the hell out of one.  One thinks we cannot handle this.  Ms Ahern's point was key to this.  When the platforms' complaints mechanisms are in place, by the time the most egregious cases come to the regulator they are actually small in number but they are significantly damaging to that individual and irreparable.  We have had this good conversation already with the BAI and its fears were somewhat allayed by what we said.  If one looks at Australia, the numbers reported in its annual report are very small compared to the population of Australia.  It is very doable.  Even if we were to get it right in Ireland which is absolutely what we should be doing, we should be leading by example here and being the leaders in Europe on this one.  It is very doable, within the resources of, or even maybe some extra resources within, the BAI.

I take the view we should set up the media commission and the online safety commissioner.  They will be flawed and there will be problems from the start because technology is changing so quickly it will not be able to cover everything.  Quite frequently, we set up regulators and let the legislation catch up.  We need to deal with the issues around some of the principles.  We will be dealing with the use of biometrics very soon, particularly TikTok and its use of biometric data.  We will be dealing with that issue and trying to address it.

An amendment could be included that imposes a legal obligation on the online safety commissioner to consult with children and young people on a corporate basis.  That would inform any of his or her actions in this space.  There is a plethora of organisations with expertise in this area.  The Government has its participation unit and the Ombudsman for Children's Office has its own participation work.  There are many ways that could happen.  That is the best way to ensure children and young children are consulted in any of those mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  I completely agree with the Senator on profiling.  There was much talk about the digital age of consent a number of years ago, which just fell well short.  We should have been talking about why we could not ban the profiling of young children's data and its commercial exploitation.  Why can we not do that?  That is what the conversation should have been about instead of this mock mechanism that was meant to protect children's data but, so far, has not done a very good job.  We certainly support and back any amendment in that area.  The Irish Heart Foundation got an amendment carried relating to that data protection legislation but, unfortunately, it was not brought into force due to the European Commission.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator's party in particular has talked about the international space and what is happening at EU level.  Some of these matters will have to be dealt with at EU level because one of the principles of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is that there is meant to be equality in the marketing of products.  When Ireland tries to impose a better standard in that space, we will probably come into contact with EU law.  That is something that might need to be dealt with at an international level.  Different attempts could be made on that when legislating for the online safety Bill and online safety commissioner. <\/p> <p>  I am concerned about any delay in the establishment of an online safety commissioner.  As Ms Ahern and Ms Jennings said, it can take ten years to develop EU law and much experience will be missed.  It is also very important to imagine the impact the establishment of an online safety commissioner in Ireland will have on the rest of the European Union and the shaping it will do at EU level.  Ireland could play a massive global role in keeping children safe online and I hope we go in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ward.

On the reference to the digital age of consent introduced three years ago, we know that despite all the debates at the time about the appropriate age and different European countries opting for different ages while we opted for 16, ultimately, it did not really matter, because the companies collect the data anyway.  They just do not use consent as the basis to collect it.  Professor Sonia Livingstone in the UK and others have done some very good research on this.  These things need to be meaningful.  If we are to spend all this time, effort and investment of resources the measures need to work.  I agree that we should be protecting children's data and not micro-profiling them.  TikTok introduced measures this year committed to not micro-profiling 13- to 16-year-olds so that should apply to any platform used by a 13- to 16-year-old.  We should be seeing these measures much more widely utilised.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the points about consultation.  There should be many opportunities built in for young people to have their say.

The issue probably is that many people do not realise their data is being exploited in the way that it is.  As Ms Cooney said, we are not educating people at a young age about what is actually happening to their data and their data profile and how it could be used against them in later life.  Certain behaviours online could be used against them by insurance brokers, etc., because those behaviours might predict they may get a form of cancer by drinking, eating certain foods or whatever.

One of their points related to the fact there is a bit of a disconnect with teachers of an older generation and parents, who are older and who may not have grown up in the world of Instagram, TikTok and Facebook, so there may be a lack of understanding.  They presented the excellent idea of having advocates and activists from within their peer group for safe online behaviour and to talk about issues such as cyberbullying, the posting of harmful content and so on.

I think I speak for everybody here when I say we all had a little smile on our faces when they were commenting on their experience of online safety education.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, with the support of the Vodafone Ireland Foundation, we were in a position to hold a consultation with more than 100 young people on this exact point on the experience of online safety education.  A couple of things came out of that in that, first, there was a huge disparity in the quality and the frequency of online safety education received and, second, they felt online safety education should be on the curriculum and viewed as a life skills subject.<\/p> <p>  It is probably a broader discussion outside the role of the online safety commissioner but I can understand it when they talk about being lectured about this.  We can often feel lectured when is something is coming up randomly and sporadically.  If we really want our children to be digitally confident and we want them to have a good understanding of online safety, we need to embed it across the curriculum.  I would even suggest messages at a preschool level.  I was recently reading a book to my daughter, who is five, and I was surprised to see there were messages in the book on how to keep safe online.  Deputy Mythen talked about his grandchildren and the smart toys they have, and the education that is needed around that.  On the back of that, for parents, grandparents and carers, again with the support of the Vodafone Ireland Foundation, we were able to develop a digital-ready hub, which has a plethora of resources that cover issues such as digital resilience, privacy and security, online harm and cyberbullying.  Again, I can share the link afterwards.<\/p> <p>  I can totally understand where they were coming from.

The witnesses have relayed their views in that regard.  It was interesting to hear that the schools programmes are outdated and that there are problems with teachers not feeling confident enough to teach or portray the dangers.  Have the witnesses identified specific powers that are needed in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#K00500","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620860400,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I would model it on the Australian example.  It has many powers with regard to both public awareness and education.  We mentioned earlier that it has the power, for example, to accredit and recommend online safety programmes, which makes a significant difference for a school seeking to book such a programme.  It runs thematic campaigns as well.  I know those issues are touched on in the Bill but they are not elaborated on.  A lot of the detail remains to be addressed, but that is what we are seeking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Alex Cooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":671,"content":"<p>That is perfect.

As Ms Cooney stated, it would be fantastic if there were specific powers for oversight specifically for the reasons I outlined previously, that is, the significant disparity in how anything to do with online safety or digital competence is delivered, whether it be inside the school or by external providers.  It would be fantastic if that could be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021051300002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1620860400,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I thank our guests and my colleagues who have been participating.
