This is Aer Lingus&rsquo;s fifth time attending this committee since the pandemic started.  On this occasion, we are here to discuss the operational issues associated with the sector&rsquo;s recovery.<\/p> <p>  I will take these issues in turn, starting by putting the disruptions in the aviation sector in context.  Doubtlessly, passenger experience has suffered across the aviation sector this summer and some Aer Lingus customers have had their travel disrupted.  While Aer Lingus has had cancellations, our flight completion rate was 100% in May and more than 98% in June.  Therefore, the vast majority of our customers and their baggage were successfully delivered.  Indeed, Aer Lingus operated one of the most robust schedules of any of the European network carriers.  We planned, for example, to operate 8,353 flights in June, and we operated 8,130 flights.  Therefore, if we compare Aer Lingus' cancellation rate of 1.8% in June with rates elsewhere among large European network carriers, we can see that Lufthansa cancelled 10% of its operations, Air France cancelled 7%, KLM cancelled 11% and EasyJet cancelled 14%.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus apologises to all customers caught up in disruptions and we assure them we are doing everything we can to resolve the issues.<\/p><p>Aer Lingus is incredibly frustrated with the operational disruptions this summer and our staff are doing a remarkable job under significant pressure.  I publicly thank the Aer Lingus people and team for what they are doing to look after customers over this summer, with the very many challenges that we are facing.<\/p><p> I will first comment on the readiness of Aer Lingus for the summer.  Last October, we published our schedule.  We were clear, at that point, of our intention to operate 90% of the 2019 level by the peak summer.  We made our schedules publically available.  We put our schedules on sale.  After the Omicron wave, at the end of last year and beginning of this year, we reiterated our intention to reach 90% of pre-Covid capacity by the summer peak.  Aer Lingus planned for this.  We planned, recruited and adjusted contracts, where necessary, to ensure that we had the right resources going into the summer, and the right resources with more of a buffer than we would have had for any normal summer.  Indeed, in terms of staffing levels, for what was 81% of passengers last June, we had 91% of our staff.   There was a significant increase, therefore, in the buffer that we would normally have to accommodate and support any disruption that we might see.  Nevertheless, the level of disruption in the system has been significant, which has had an impact on our customers and I will discuss this matter shortly.  The readiness of Aer Lingus was not matched by airports and ground handling companies around the network.  If every airport and handling agent was as ready as Aer Lingus, then we would not be facing the scale of disruption that passengers are seeing across the network.<\/p><p> I turn to airports and later I will more broadly discuss airports around Europe.  In terms of Dublin Airport, I will not cover the specifics of the issues at the beginning of the season as I think that they have been well covered at this committee.  Undoubtedly, we have seen an improvement, particularly in screening, at the airport as the summer has progressed and as resources have come on board with the DAA.  Aer Lingus acknowledges that those improvements have been in place.<\/p><p> We need to see improvements not only in security screening but also in bussing services, which move passengers and crew around the airport, and in passenger mobility services, which enables passengers to get on and off an aircraft in a timely manner.  We need to see improvement in all of those sectors and, indeed, in the cleanliness around the airport as well.<\/p><p> The advice for passengers to arrive at the airport 2.5 hours before departure for a short-haul flight and 3.5 hours before departure for a long-haul flight remains problematic for us.  Passengers check in or drop off a bag during the early morning peak so they compete with passengers who are flying later in the day.  That situation causes a level of congestion at the points of check in and bag drop, which would be unnecessary if the recommendations were not in place.  We need to see further improvements but there has been significant improvements so far this summer.  We trust that the work is under way to permanently address these issues.  Please note that these issues are not unique to Dublin, which I will discuss in a moment.<\/p><p> More generally, we feel the impact of the infrastructure deficit at Dublin Airport in operations today.  That situation will become more critical in the future.  Therefore, it is really important that these infrastructural deficits are addressed in a timely manner as the airport and airlines grow passenger numbers into the future.<\/p><p> I refer to the wider aviation system pressures that we are seeing and experiencing.  Our operating model of network carriers like Aer Lingus requires significant passengers flows from other airlines and short-haul flights on to long-haul flights.  It is inherently more complex than that of a point-to-point airline.  We operate to nine out the ten European airports that have been most impacted by disruption and we see that in our connecting traffic, and through the impact on connecting customers in the Dublin hub.<\/p><p> I would like to outline some of the pressures that the system is experiencing.  We are seeing an under-resourcing at airports, particularly across Europe.  We are seeing under resourcing with ground handlers and other airlines across Europe.  That has been a failures of those parties to plan for the return in demand that we had expected for this summer.  As a consequence, we are being told to do mandatory cancellations, particularly from Amsterdam airport and Heathrow airport, to reduce our flights and the number of flights that we had planned.  We are seeing security screening issues and baggage system failures in these airports, particularly at Amsterdam Airport and Heathrow Airport.  Where airports have closed terminals, and not yet reopened them, so the terminals where we are operating are incredibly congested and the infrastructure struggles to cope.  We are seeing stand and gate availability problems when we arrive in these European airports.  In addition, there has been industrial action, particularly by French and Italian air traffic control, which has added further disruption to this summer.  Finally, we have not seen the end of Covid sickness, which has impacted Aer Lingus in recent months and also has an impact on many of the resources around the European system.<\/p><p> These are a unique set of challenges as Aer Lingus and other airlines ramp up into the summer.  I will now explore about what that means for our operations and for some of our customers.  The reality is that the operational challenges make it impossible for Aer Lingus to deliver the experience that we would like for some of our customers.  The vast majority or more than 98% of flights are operating as planned and the vast majority of customers are getting to their destination as planned.  However, we are seeing impacts of the delays in the system.  These effects include: queues at check-in areas as passengers arrive early, as we have seen at Dublin Airport, for security screening; delays at security screening, thus passengers are late getting to the aircraft for boarding and departure; delays elsewhere in Europe for passengers with reduced mobility and the airport services provided to get those passengers on and off the aircraft; delays in bussing across the European system in moving passengers and crew around the airports; and delays having an impact on stand availability at airports around Europe for incoming aircraft, which causes knock-on delays.  This means that we can start the day ready with crew, aircraft and ground handling resources but as the day progresses we see the following: poor punctuality as all of these issues around the European system play out; customers and their bags miss connecting flights; and as delays compound matters over the course of the day, our crews reach their duty hour limits and that can have an impact on their availability for the next day's rosters.  These issues are compounding.  Due to all of these factors we must occasionally cancel flights, which leads to further disruption. <\/p><p> In terms of baggage issues, for the point-to-point journeys such as simple journeys like Dublin to Malaga, the vast majority of passengers and bags travel there with no issues at all.  Where we see particular problems is with connecting bags.  I mean connecting bags that come from big European airports that are experiencing problems.  In fact, 60% of the issues that we see with out bags stem from connections from other airlines so interline connections on to Aer Lingus.  In many cases, we have never seen nor touched those bags, and those bags do not make it to Dublin to be reunited with the passenger.<\/p><p> The huge increase in the number of misplaced bags across the system puts significant strain on our resources in Dublin.  Mr. O'Neill and his team are working incredibly hard to locate bags and reunite them with passengers, as much as we can.  They are clearing bags every day but we find more bags are misplaced every day as we continue to operate to these airports that suffer from these problems.<\/p><p>There was a peak of 1,800 open files associated with baggage in mid-June.  That figure has now been reduced to 1,200.  We are still clearing bags and experiencing further bag problems on a daily basis at the main hub airports of Heathrow, Amsterdam and Paris, in particular.<\/p><p> These issues compound to affect customer experience and customer care.  As a consequence of everything I have outlined, our customer call centres are inundated with queries that relate to ticketing, baggage issues, cancellations and missed connections.  Over the last four weeks, the volume of calls to our call centres has increased massively in comparison with pre-pandemic levels.  The time is it taking agents to deal with each issue has increased fourfold due to the complex nature of customer queries.  For the most part, the issues are outside of our control and therefore difficult to resolve for customers.  That is resulting in an unprecedented increase in demand on our call centres.  Given the volume of demand we are now dealing with, we are unable to provide the level of care we would like to provide for each and every customer who has experienced disruption.  As I said, every cancellation and missed bag hurts.  We apologise to every customer who has had a less than satisfactory experience.  We are doing everything we can to try to mitigate the issues, most of which are outside of our control.<\/p><p> On our schedule, we have leased aircraft and crew to provide extra backup in the case of cancellations and disruption.  We have extended connection times between flights to try to minimise the number of bags and customers caught up in delays or having problems making their connecting flights.  We have continued to recruit staff.  Even though we were ready for the volumes of the summer, the extra disruption issues are putting a further burden on our resources.  We have continued to recruit staff in light of the disruption being experienced.  We have deployed technology and new processes to try to locate bags.  We are using third-party transport operators to try to get bags to customers as quickly as possible.  We have added more staff to our call centres.  We deploy volunteers from head office and the support areas of the business to the airport every day to try to help our operational teams with the issues and to expedite the resolution of baggage issues, in particular.<\/p><p> I trust this gives members some indication of the challenges that Aer Lingus is facing in what is a very disrupted summer for the industry and the steps we are taking in response to those challenges.  As I said, the pressures to which I have referred are pressures in the wider aviation system.  Dublin Airport is by no means the only airport at which they exist.   Despite the challenges, Aer Lingus is performing strongly in managing the issues that are within our control.  We are also doing everything possible to influence and address the many matters that are outside of our control.  I reiterate my thanks to Aer Lingus staff, who are going above and beyond to help customers as they work through this very challenging summer.<\/p><p> To conclude on a more positive note, I wish to put the scale of the increase in passenger numbers into context.   In June 2021, a mere 300,000 passengers travelled through Dublin Airport.  The figure for June 2022 was 2.8 million.  While the recovery in traffic has brought many challenges, it is critical to the wider Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022072600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynne Embleton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1658790000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Harrison to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022072600002#F00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1658790000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting the DAA to attend today's meeting.  When the DAA last appeared before the committee on 1 June, we addressed the very challenging events of Sunday, 29 May, which saw 1,400 passengers miss their flights as a result of lengthy queues at Dublin Airport&rsquo;s security screening areas.  While there is no room for complacency, I am pleased to report that seven weeks on, the airport's security screening processes are now on a far more robust and sustainable footing.<\/p> <p>  At our meeting with the committee in June, the DAA outlined the substantial capacity challenges we faced as we sought to bridge Dublin Airport&rsquo;s resourcing gap and meet the demands of a rapid spike in air travel across the globe.  We also acknowledged a number of key shortcomings with respect to the airport&rsquo;s operations on 29 May and laid out our plans to address these challenges and restore confidence for our passengers.<\/p><p>As a result of the implementation of these plans, the wait times at the airport&rsquo;s security screening areas have now improved significantly.  During June, Dublin Airport served more than 2.8 million passengers in total, and more than 90% of all passengers were processed through security in 45 minutes or less.  During July, we have continued to see exceptional levels of growth at the airport.  Over the full month of July, we expect that the airport will serve almost 3.1 million passengers, an average of 100,000 passengers every day.  Despite this rapid growth, further improvements to the airport's security performance have been successfully achieved.  To date in July, more than 95% of all passengers have been processed through security in under 45 minutes.  More than 85% of passengers have queued for 30 minutes or less.  Prudent contingency measures have been put in place by both the DAA and the Government to provide safeguards should any external challenges arise.  However, these measures have not been required to date given the operational improvements made.<\/p><p> At present, Dublin Airport continues to advise passengers to arrive 2.5 hours in advance for a short-haul flight and 3.5 hours in advance of a long-haul flight.  This advice remains prudent in the current circumstances.  As outlined, while positive progress has been achieved with respect to security queue times, we are advising passengers that they should continue to allow up to one hour to clear security screening.  In addition, they then need to walk to their gate and board their aircraft.  The current advice allows sufficient time for this.  If a passenger is checking a bag, this requires additional time.  As a result, we continue to advise that, where possible, passengers should allow up to one additional hour where they need to do so.  We also recommend that they confirm specific opening times for the airline that they are travelling with.  Airlines can also communicate directly with their own intending passengers to provide more tailored advice, should they wish to do so.  While the early presentation of passengers remains a feature across the industry, we believe this has arisen as a result of general anxiety levels with respect to international travel.  This trend is therefore unlikely to abate until the overall narrative regarding air travel becomes more positive.<\/p><p>  The airport&rsquo;s recruitment programme is also continuing at pace.  When the DAA last met the committee, we indicated that we intended to bring a further 70 security officers into our business during June, with no upper limits placed on recruitment in the period beyond.  In fact, during June we recruited almost 100 new airport security unit officers.  During July, we have brought more than 50 further recruits into the business.  This means that since October 2021, we have now delivered a total increase of 356 security staff in our terminals, net of exits.  Security staffing levels have almost returned to 2019 levels, while recruitment is continuing.  Recruiting, retaining and training such a large number of new staff members to the very high standards required is challenging.  This will continue to have our full focus over the weeks and months ahead.<\/p><p> Over the past seven weeks, we have also been engaging very closely with all passengers impacted by the events of 29 May.  As of this week, more than 75% of all claims received by the DAA have now either been closed out or are at an advanced stage of processing.  Additionally, our teams have put significant focus on improving standards for our passengers across all other areas of the airport.  This includes the critical area of cleanliness of airport facilities, where we acknowledge standards have suffered.  Through significant engagement with both our teams and third parties, we have now materially increased cleaning resources.  This has enabled a series of deep cleans at night and other targeted actions across the terminals.  Since we last attended the committee, almost 4,000 further task force shifts have been worked by our management and office-based teams, with more than 500 of these focused specifically on cleaning.  In addition, we are working closely with third-party food and beverage concessionaires to enhance their focus on cleaning.   We are also placing strong focus on services for our passengers with reduced mobility, and we continue to work very closely with our third-party provider with respect to this area.  Our aim is to ensure that these passengers have a positive experience and that service standards are maintained despite the significant volume growth.<\/p><p> The airport clearly still has a journey ahead to rebuild trust with our passengers and to restore all aspects of our operations to the standards that we routinely delivered pre-Covid.<\/p><p>However, it has been very encouraging to see our passengers acknowledge the marked improvement in the airport&rsquo;s operations in recent months.  As a result of the steps taken and the plans in place, we are confident that we will maintain a safe and stable operation and deliver improving standards over the days, weeks and months ahead.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to express our huge gratitude to all members of our team for their outstanding efforts in delivering these improvements.  The passion, commitment and resilience they have shown have been simply incredible.  They have shouldered huge responsibility to deliver for the travelling public and have taken strong initial steps to restore pride and trust in Dublin Airport.  I also thank the travelling public for their patience and understanding during this period.  In particular, I thank them for their very many positive messages of support, both directly and through social media, which have been hugely appreciated by our colleagues across the business.<\/p><p> While airport operations have seen considerable improvements over the past seven weeks, a range of other significant challenges have emerged across the wider international aviation network.  This has been reflected in the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights to and from Dublin Airport during July to date.  Many of these cancellations have taken place as a result of flight caps imposed at other airports or due to capacity constraints experienced by airlines as a result of Covid-19.  Passengers have also experienced a range of other impacts, including luggage delays, both in Ireland and abroad.  As the challenges in these areas have intensified, I believe there has been a growing understanding among passengers of just how complex the causes of these issues are.  There has also been increased awareness of the respective responsibilities and interdependencies that exist within our industry.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, as an airport operator, DAA has direct responsibility for the airport&rsquo;s security operations, the airport infrastructure and the overall experience passengers have within our terminals.  As outlined, since the challenges of 29 May, significant work has been undertaken to address the difficulties faced in these areas.  While challenges remain, I hope our passengers are now seeing the impact of these actions.  However, as an airport operator, DAA does not control areas such as airline flight cancellations or the handling of passengers&rsquo; baggage.  The responsibility for these specific areas sits with the airlines and their ground handling agents.  Similar to DAA, they are taking considerable steps to address the challenges they are currently facing in this respect, which I am sure they will outline to the committee in more detail today.<\/p><p> Passengers are becoming increasingly aware of the global nature of the issues currently facing the sector.  There are few countries that have not been impacted by the current challenges.  From the UK to Europe, the US, Australia and Asia, the issues relating to flight cancellations, delays and passenger baggage are dominating headlines right across the globe.  In recent months, airports such Heathrow, Gatwick, Frankfurt and Amsterdam Schiphol have been forced to implement flight caps as a result of severe challenges faced by their passengers.  This in turn has impacted on the holiday and travel plans of millions of people.  This is a course of action that we have worked extremely hard to avoid at Dublin Airport.  Our aim has been to ensure that our passengers make their flights and get to take that long-awaited and much-deserved holiday.  Through the implementation of our plans, we have succeeded in avoiding the types of flight caps and cancellations that are now in place at many other European airports.<\/p><p> Looking forward, the industry will remain challenged over the period ahead.  All industry players, including airports, airlines and ground handlers, will need to address their own specific challenges in order to restore the high standards that passengers expect of us all.  Ultimately, however, every single player within our industry is united by one key factor - the passengers we serve.  If any one element of the ecosystem faces difficulties, whether it is the airport, the airlines, the ground handling services or any other player within the supply chain network, the overall passenger experience is impacted.  As a result, industry collaboration will be more important than ever as we look to the future.  This is something we are totally committed to over the period ahead.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for extending the invitation to today&rsquo;s meeting to DAA.  I look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022072600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Harrison","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1658790000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak at this meeting.  As one of several handlers operating in Dublin, and with around 80% of flights being self-handled by airlines, I must be clear that we are not able to speak on behalf of all ground handlers or the aviation industry as a whole.<\/p><p>While we will outline a number of significant hurdles we have faced as the demand for air travel has returned, Swissport itself has consistently seen good outputs in baggage handling and on-time performance.  Some 85% of flights handled by Swissport have left on time or early from Dublin Airport.  We acknowledge that this is lower than we would expect and that there is work to be done but we are pleased that we have maintained a stable performance.  This has been achievable thanks to the incredible support and flexibility of our employees and the co-operation our customer airlines.<\/p><p> We understand that many passengers travelling through Dublin Airport have had an unacceptable experience over the last few months.  While Swissport will always take responsibility and apologise for any occasion where it has played a part in disruption, we are proud that we have managed to deliver for our customers despite some very challenging circumstances.  Swissport has put significant effort, finance and planning into our readiness for the summer at Dublin, bringing in over 300 additional employees so far this year.  This has meant we have been able to provide additional handling support and requests within the airport, outside of initial programs of work and schedules.  This is one example of how we all, across the industry and in government, need to continue working together so passengers can fly with confidence.  We have also used the global Swissport network, as the largest provider of ground handling services worldwide, to fly in experienced and highly trained personnel from other Swissport locations across Europe to support the skills and experience gap.  There have been a number of hurdles in reaching this position.<\/p><p> It is important to remember that the pandemic had a severe impact on the aviation industry, worse than any in living memory.  Globally, aviation was brought nearly to a standstill.  Aviation experts across the board predicted that it would take years to recover.  It is positive news that flight volumes are now returning but this rapid return in demand, after long uncertainty, has exacerbated resource challenges across the board in aviation.  While we are pleased that in Ireland, thanks to a collaborative process with our trade union partners and being able to make use of the pandemic unemployment payment scheme, we were able to hold off redundancies.  However, two years of travel bans and restrictions have resulted in many knowledgeable and experienced employees making a tough choice to leave the sector for more stable employment.<\/p><p> Also in Ireland, the newly introduced enhanced background checks in January 2022 resulted in a complete standstill in the approval and issuing of airport ID passes, effectively resulting in no employees being recruited in the first three months of the year.  Approvals now take an average of around four weeks but we have found some prospective recruits cannot wait for the time it takes for this process to be completed.  Security checks are of course vital to the safety of all airport users but we must be clear that this has delayed our ability to effectively train and deploy new employees.  In the UK, we have been able to use temporary escorted passes to enable new employees to support operations and complete essential training.  However, this was not an option in Ireland until recently.  We and other airline partners lobbied the DAA and the Department of Transport to consider making use of this initiative.  It is a key opportunity to provide an immediate injection of critical manpower while waiting for security checks to be completed.<\/p><p> A key part of the ramp operations role is being able to drive the airport vehicles used to transport luggage to and from the aircraft and terminal buildings.  However, with the rules brought in by the Department of Transport and the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, preventing non-EU licenceholders from driving for work purposes on airport grounds, we have a significant deficit of equipment operators at Dublin Airport.  With a wait of between three and four months for the Irish driving examinations these workers are required to complete, they will not be fully utilised until Christmas 2022.  This will continue to impact operations until then.<\/p><p> These issues, combined with knock-on delays from other parts of the journey, such as security, check-in, baggage, flight schedules and air traffic, have led to very challenging conditions over the last few months across the UK and Ireland.  At Dublin Airport we have specifically seen an adverse impact from the significant queues at security, continued volatility in flight schedules and infrastructure challenges.  The short-shipped baggage volumes in Dublin for Swissport and handled by Swissport have remained very low and within normal parameters.  We have helped where we can to tackle the disruption caused by short-shipping from the major hubs that feed into Dublin.  Ultimately, baggage is one of the more visual parts of the complex process behind every flight.  People should understand that because of its position at the end of the process, it is often the baggage handlers who have to absorb the knock-on effects of delays further up the chain, so they are already facing a delay before they get to start on their part of the process.  This is not to deflect blame onto any one party but a reminder that aviation can be viewed as an ecosystem where delays in one part combine and escalate to cause delays in another part.  It is not just about how quickly baggage is loaded on and off the aircraft.  Nevertheless, we reiterate that despite the challenges outlined, Swissport&rsquo;s own operations have held up remarkably well.  Our preparations have resulted in us being in a strong enough position to support our airline partners, as previously described, with our staff working extremely hard with these partners to minimise the impact on passengers.<\/p><p>I must be clear that we can only speak for our own operations and remain proud that we have been in a position to provide this additional support at Dublin Airport and minimise disruption.  We will continue to work with industry partners and the Government to facilitate long-awaited flights for passengers so they can be assured of a smooth experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022072600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Tully","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1658790000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting Sky Handling Partner, SHP, to appear.  SHP provides third-party ground handling services to airlines at Dublin Airport.  The observations and opinions my colleague, Mr. Kenny, and I will offer are solely those of the company; they are not expressed on behalf of airlines, other ground handling agents or any other airport community member.<\/p> <p>  During the pandemic, it was appropriate and entirely justified that public health was prioritised.  The restrictions imposed on international travel resulted in a 75% reduction in our activity at Dublin Airport.  Inevitably, a contraction in our workforce took place as valued teams members opted to seek employment in industries they considered more secure.  The exodus of skilled experience and expertise in 2020 and 2021 will take time to replenish but robust progress is being made.<\/p> <p>  SHP is mindful and conscious of the travel experience of passengers at Dublin Airport this year.  The rapid rebound in international travel has presented significant challenges for aviation globally.  Dublin has been no exception in this regard.  Our service standards simply have not returned to the pre-pandemic level.  On-time performance sits 25% below where it was pre-pandemic.  SHP accepts and acknowledges responsibility for shortcomings in our performance standards in 2022 and sincerely apologises where this has resulted in disruption and inconvenience for passengers.<\/p> <p>  As a company, we have invested substantial resources to increase our workforce, with financial incentives to promote recruitment and retention.  Post pandemic, it is critical that ground handling can attract the best and brightest to our industry.  I am pleased that SHP has managed to recruit 280 employees who are either live on current operations or due to complete training within the next fortnight.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out the difficulties associated with recruitment in the first three months of 2022 due to the implementation of the EU regulation in respect of enhanced security background checks.  Although security and safety are paramount in any airport environment, the processing time to perform these additional checks was excessive, with it taking several weeks for airport IDs to be completed, ensuring there was no material uplift in resource levels for quarter 1 of 2022.  Formal correspondence was sent to the Department of Transport and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 10 March, outlining our concerns and referencing the potential impact on operations at Dublin Airport this year.  The current airport ID processing time has reduced to three to four weeks, which is a more reasonable and manageable timeframe, and this is to be welcomed.  The recent increase in airport escort IDs, to 14 days, provides an opportunity for our new employees to undertake additional airside training.  Again, this is to be welcomed and acknowledged as an example of relevant stakeholders working together to address the unique challenges for summer 2022.<\/p> <p>  A source of frustration as we embark on a significant upskilling programme of current staff is the number of non-EU licence holders who are restricted from driving at the airport.  A key element of our operation is having sufficient numbers of drivers trained to operate vehicles that ferry passenger baggage and cargo to and from the aircraft side.  It is important that the Department of Transport and the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, revisit these restrictions as this would immediately provide a large increase in the driving pool available to SHP.<\/p> <p>  Short-shipped baggage volumes from international hubs that feed Dublin Airport have been at an unprecedented scale and continue to prove extremely challenging.  Some European airports have imposed passenger or flight caps to minimise disruption for the remainder of the summer season.  Likewise, there has been curtailment of certain airline schedules and it is expected that this will help alleviate, but not eliminate, the instances of short-shipped baggage.<\/p><p>In the meantime, SHP, with the support of DAA, has managed to secure a landside location adjacent to terminals 1 and 2.  This location enables us to move baggage to a secure site where our teams can work on processing bags for local delivery by courier, or reflighting if necessary.  More important, it also permits passengers to attend and claim lost baggage directly.  This is a critical development as passenger access to airside locations is limited by security protocols.  In addition, airlines are extensively supporting the repatriation of baggage by sending support teams to Dublin.<\/p><p> SHP has a strong and proud record of achievement through the past two decades.  We are a proactive and valued member of the airport community and have engaged constructively with all relevant stakeholders to mitigate the impact of disruption at Dublin Airport this year.  We are committed to contributing to an improved passenger experience at Dublin Airport.  It is important that I publicly commend the effort, flexibility and commitment demonstrated by SHP front-line staff and support teams in recent months.  I am very proud of each and every one of them.  Equally, I am grateful for the excellent collaboration and partnership of our airline customers during these exceptional times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022072600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darren Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1658790000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moloney.

The flight departs, it picks up delays because of the need to wait for customers to get through screening and for passengers with restricted mobility to come off aircraft.  It also picks up delays because stands at other airports are congested.  Those delays mean that passengers miss connections, and crew have extended hours and can come up against their duty limits.  The delays have been prevalent all the way through the summer and it is those delays that have started to impact significantly on our operations.  I come back to the point that the vast majority of our customers are still travelling with their bags.  It is only in the case of a small number of passengers that the process gets disrupted.

It has been very informative and it brought us up to date.  It was important that we had this meeting.  It has also given our visitors the opportunity to convey to the public how the airport works.  The DAA was taking the brunt of everybody&rsquo;s criticism.  Everybody thought it was the cause of all the problems at the airport.  Obviously, the running of the airport and the aviation industry is a complex operation.  There is a level of interdependency and collaboration that makes the system work.  As we have heard, I think the public is now more aware, because they never been under more scrutiny.  There has been huge media attention.  As a result of that, people now understand how the system works.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the collaboration, it is at a high level at this time because everyone has to work together to overcome the difficulties that are there.  What is the hierarchy?  Is there a system or are there procedures in place?  Do the witnesses meet regularly?  Do the heads of each group meet?  How do they, in a normal course when the airport is running well, interact?  Is there a formal procedure or is it simply a case of acting or connecting with each other when it is necessary?  <\/p> <p>  When we had the DAA in last time, we had many prophecies about doom and gloom.  The DAA responded splendidly.  It did an exceptionally good job under difficult circumstances.

It would not have worked without the focus and concentration of the workforce.  Going through the airport, one sees the same people doing the same job.  It is so repetitive.  They have to remain in good humour and handle so many different people.  Obviously, the public gets agitated and it is not an easy job.  Today, we should compliment them on the work they are doing and hope that they continue to do that.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that 2.8 million passengers went through the airport in June.  Many of them had baggage.  We got the answers regarding how much baggage has been delayed and what have you.  We have here today Swissport, SHP and Aer Lingus.  What proportion of baggage is handled by whom?  How much of the business is handled by Swissport, SHP and the airlines themselves, respectively?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022072600002#T00400","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1658790000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>At Dublin Airport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022072600002#T00500","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1658790000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Yes, at Dublin Airport.<\/p> <p>  In terms of ID, that is a problem every year.

It is our connection to the massive hub that is Heathrow.  When that is removed or disrupted in any way it has an impact on business, tourism and future investment.  I ask that Aer Lingus take that into account to minimise the impact.  I acknowledge some of this is out of the airline's hands.

Generally, between 30% to 80% of customers on long-haul flights will be transferring and that is where the hub dynamics really matter.  Usually, there is insufficient point-to-point demand to operate a breadth of services.  JFK Airport is a good example where point-to-point will justify the filling of a commercial service.  Boston is another.  However, when one gets beyond those big markets, connecting traffic is needed to fill the aircraft to sustain the service.  Typically, a breadth of services is obtained from the hubs because they can draw on the short-haul network to provide enough onward passengers to supplement point-to-point passengers and make a service viable.  There will always be a much easier case for going long haul out of a hub than there would be out of another airport.

The aircraft movements may be there, but then there is also a question, especially when it comes to security screening, concerning how full those aircraft are going to be.

I will begin with an example.  I received a letter this week from a person who said that their family, ten people in total, were to fly from Dublin to Faroe yesterday, 23 July at 7.45 a.m.<\/p><p>They arrived at the airport at 2 a.m. and checked in their luggage.  At 7.30 a.m., they were informed that the flight was delayed for technical reasons.  At 8.30 a.m., they were told the flight was delayed due to technical issues.  At 9 a.m., they were sent to a different gate and told to wait for further updates.  At 11 a.m., four members of the group were called up to the gate and given new boarding passes.  On speaking to a staff member, the lead traveller managed to get on the flight to Portugal.  The context of this email is that this left a member of the travelling public distraught and upset.  I am a supporter of Aer Lingus and to be fair to the staff of the airline, they deserve huge credit and praise.  However, the point I find most upsetting is this traveller reports that the staff could not have been ruder or more nonchalant.<\/p><p> I am not here to beat anybody up.  I am a former chairman of an Oireachtas committee so I understand the Chairman&rsquo;s job and our job.  However, we have had a summer of discontent.

It is in the DNA of everyone in Aer Lingus to care.  Every bag matters.  Every customer who is disrupted matters, which is why we have been adding resources, calling on volunteers and doing everything within our power to try to make the experience of customers better and when they are disrupted to try to look after them.
