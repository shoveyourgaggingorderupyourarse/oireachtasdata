The substantive desire in the petition, however, needs more debate in Leinster House.  There is a increasing number of people, North and South, who wish to seek Irish unity and there has been a change in the demographics on the island.  We have the issue of Brexit, which is barrelling along and will happen less than 50 days from now.  The only solution to a hard border is no border for many people.  This Government and the Oireachtas need to get to grips with the issue of Irish unity in a far deeper manner and start to prepare for it.  It is dangerous for the Oireachtas to have its head in the sand with regard to what is happening North and South.  The Government needs to start instituting plans for the development of Irish unity.<\/p><p>There are many steps we could take in advance of Brexit which would strengthen the all-Ireland economy, help to ameliorate the worst threats of Brexit and lead to convergence on both sides of the island in a range of areas such as healthcare, taxation, education and so on.  This would lead to economies of scale, efficiencies and larger markets and have positive outputs for everybody and improve lives of people across the island of Ireland.  We have seen a number of political developments in the past week or so which have led to more of an all-Ireland perspective in politics of Ireland.  While the language of the petition makes it impossible for the committee to continue with it, the issue of Irish unity contained within it needs to be one that demands far more debate in Leinster House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019021300002#BB00300","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550064600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy T&oacute;b&iacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019021300002#CC00200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1550064600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I echo the points made by Deputy T&oacute;b&iacute;n.  We are all aware that a conversation on an united Ireland is taking place in villages and towns.  More recently, a major conference was held in the Waterfront in Belfast where civic nationalism society came together.  The conference was addressed by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, and the deputy Leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Dara Calleary, also spoke at it.  I am concerned that the conversation is happening outside the walls of the Houses of the Oireachtas and believe we need to have some dialogue.  It is unfortunate that the petition is written in a manner that does not allow it to move forward.  However, we need to be mindful of what is happening.  I do not accept that the movement is premature.  It is 100 years since the inaugural meeting of the First D&aacute;il; therefore, let us get real about the issue.  I do not believe we can use the excuse that it is a sensitive subject or that it causes divisions.  If that is the case, we would never have held a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, on marriage equality and so on.  We have to be mindful of the language to be used in the response as this conversation is happening across the land.  People are talking about the issue.  This House needs to get itself in gear on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019021300002#CC00300","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1550064600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mitchell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019021300002#CC00400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1550064600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have a conversation in the Houses of the Oireachtas on achieving the goal of an united Ireland.  The pathway towards that goal has been laid clearly after decades of negotiated positions and making sure there will be no more bloodshed, leaving people maimed or dead on the streets, either in the North, Dublin city centre or the cities of England.  I have no problem in having a forthright debate here, but anything that goes outside the parameters of a negotiated position between the two Governments cannot be endorsed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  There is significant work being done by Members inside these walls, including Senator Mark Daly who has been working consistently on the issue, privately going to meet members of the unionist community on a monthly basis, attending and briefing meetings in Orange halls on the issue.  These things are not talked about.  Documents have also been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas indicating what the structures of an united Ireland would look like and how much they would benefit the economy as a whole as opposed to a partitioned state.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell talked about the conversations happening in towns across the country.  She is 100% correct.  It happened in our town, where last year on this very issue in front of a couple of hundred people Deputy T&oacute;b&iacute;n, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, and I had a conversation, moderated by Se&aacute;n Boylan, whose father was an operative for Michael Collins at the time of the creation of the Irish Free State.  The public is engaging in that conversation.  <\/p> <p>  This morning the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, a primary negotiator of the Good Friday Agreement, appeared before a select committee in the Houses of Parliament at Westminster.  When asked by one MP how he thought the Irish people would feel about \"rejoining\" the United Kingdom, I think he said in a kind way, \"not a lot.\"  He has spoken about the fact that we do not need to see a hardening of the two sectarian positions in achieving the goal of an united Ireland in a settlement that would be acceptable to all sides.  <\/p> <p>  In the context of initiating plans, there is a mountain of work to be done in the background before we would even get to the position where a Border poll could be held.  Some 12 years ago I remember taking part in a peace and reconciliation tour to the Peace Tower as part of the First World War commemorations.  There were marching bands from both sides of the community, including one from County Cavan and and one from County Tyrone from the unionist community.  I got to talk to some of its members over lunch.  They did not even know where County Meath was.  I might as well have said I was from somewhere in America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019021300002#CC00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1550064600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019021300002#CC00600","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1550064600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>They would probably have had a better chance of finding it on the map.  They had no idea of the geography of the Republic of Ireland.  As far as they were concerned, their country came to an end at the Border and extended no further.  It was a frightening realisation that these Irish people had no concept whatsoever of the geography of the Republic of Ireland.  If one has people on the same island who could not find County Meath on the map, just down the road from them, that gives an insight into how far we have to go in the journey towards peace and reconciliation.  There are, however, incremental steps being taken.  When the First Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, attended the Ulster Final last year, it received acres of news coverage.  Until that becomes the norm, we have a long way to go.  <\/p> <p>  In that respect, sport can play a significant role.  Organisations such as the Irish Rugby Football Union, a 32-county organisation, have a buy-in in both sections of the community.  The GAA has always been a 32-county organisation and is making strides in communities in the North to try to ensure sport can be a builder, but what was insightful was that when the Republic of Ireland played the North in a soccer friendly match before Christmas at Lansdowne Road, there were terrible scenes, with people booing during the playing of both national anthems.  It resonated the hate still felt in the country.  Given this lingering level of hate in communities and having regard to recent dissident activity, including the car bomb, there is still significant work to be done.  That is why I have referred to the work taking place week in and week out in communities.  It must be remembered that it is happening at a time when the political parties in the North cannot get their act together to form a parliament, now the parliament which has been suspended for the longest period anywhere in the world, bar none.<\/p> <p>  The petitioner refers to the fact that the people must decide their own future.  They have decided.  We had a protracted discussion on the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  The extraction of the words in those articles from the Constitution was a major issue for all republicans, but it was done to create a pathway towards an united Ireland.  Has the petitioner forgotten this?  I have not.  I know what a significant and seismic shift it was for people living in this state to make that change to the Constitution.  People, North and South, bought into it in order that the children who come to the Houses of the Oireachtas on school tours would not have to listen to weekly reports on news bulletins on RT&Eacute; and the BBC on people being blown to smithereens.  Let us remember that this happened in Omagh 20 years ago.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome this discussion.  It is welcome that there is a pathway towards an united Ireland and that there are people working quietly to try to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019021300002#CC00700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1550064600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cassells.

Notwithstanding the language used, it would send the wrong message in terms of what was referred to by Deputies Mitchell and Cassells about the pathway to an united Ireland and what we have voted on.  The important point is that we are having the conversation.  I ask members to cast their minds back to two years ago when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, was speaking about the consequence of Brexit and the issue of an united Ireland.  It is important to recognise, as Deputy Cassells said, that work is being done, for example, by people in my party such as Senator Feighan, who is very clear in his approach and has been involved in meeting, discussing, liaising and engaging with many different organisations, both community and political, in the North.  I had the pleasure of canvassing and meeting members of the SDLP and the Alliance Party.  It is important that we recognise what has been said in the recent polls on \"Claire Byrne Live\" on a united Ireland and a Border poll.  The last thing we must do is to create a political football whereby we can kick this back and forward and up and down.  This is far too important, sensitive and precious.  We must avoid language that polarises people with the hardening of sectarian positions.<\/p> <p>  The best we can do is to recognise that all of us who aspire to a 32-county Ireland know that we have reached the point through the Good Friday Agreement whereby we have a pathway.  Many people voted to get rid of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and to insert amended articles into the Constitution.  That is the present position.<\/p> <p>  The substantive text before us for consideration is divisive and sends a wrong message.

However, as repeatedly cited in our inspection reports, including the recently published report on the child protection and welfare services in the Dublin South-Central service area, Tusla has been unable to recruit a sufficient number of social workers with the right skill mix to carry out its work programme.  <\/p> <p>  During the course of HIQA&rsquo;s 2018 statutory investigation into Tusla&rsquo;s management of child sexual abuse allegations against adults of concern, Tusla staff frequently expressed concern about staff recruitment and retention.  Critical social work posts remained vacant across the country, which had an ongoing, negative impact on the consistent delivery of a high-quality and timely service.  Staff believed this deficit was constantly causing delays in the system, for example, the timely allocation of a social worker to a child and the management of child protection and welfare referrals.  The challenges in recruiting staff were persistently reported as an organisational risk at board, executive and operational levels across Tusla.  Senior Tusla managers asserted that there was an insufficient number of social work graduates in Ireland to meet Tusla&rsquo;s service needs.  Furthermore, staff indicated that inefficient and overly bureaucratic systems, together with the burden of too much paperwork, were reducing the amount of time they had to spend on direct social work with children and families. <\/p> <p>  Tusla is indeed experiencing a shortage of qualified social workers.  However, at the time of our investigation, no comprehensive, strategic approach to workforce planning was in place, which was informed by the reality of the current employment market.  For example, there was little evidence that a review of current processes and requirements, or consideration of upskilling other social care disciplines, had happened or was formally under way.  Without taking such a strategic approach, Tusla cannot rely on recurring staff shortages as the default reason for failing to deliver an efficient and safe service to children and their families.  Nor can they use this as an excuse for not providing an environment where social workers and social care workers can enjoy doing the core job they are qualified to do.  Tusla has to manage the same workforce challenges faced by other jurisdictions and, as a relatively young agency, must avoid an organisational mindset that sees such problems as insurmountable due to factors outside of its control. <\/p> <p>  One of the key recommendations emerging from our investigation was that Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs should, as a matter of urgency, seek the assistance of the higher education and training establishments to create formal career-path mechanisms for students and graduates.  HIQA also recommended that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, with the assistance of HIQA, should undertake an international review of best practice in the regulation of children&rsquo;s social services in order to inform the development of a regulatory framework for these services in Ireland.  This is with the view to providing independent assurance to the public that the State&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services are safe and effective. <\/p> <p>  In the interim, HIQA recommended that Tusla should conduct an internal operational review to simplify and integrate procedures, and invest in more administrative support to free up social work practitioners&rsquo; time and expertise.  This should include a review of the existing social worker, social care worker and support staff skill-mix, and the development of a workforce strategy.<\/p> <p>  Other jurisdictions have made best use of non-social work staff to carry out activities currently undertaken by social workers in Ireland.  In the UK, for example, following screening of referrals and during the assessment process, social work assistants are used to provide practical support or to gather information to help inform social workers in their assessment. <\/p> <p>  In December of last year, the expert assurance group established to oversee and advise on the implementation of the recommendations of HIQA&rsquo;s investigation published its first quarterly report.  The chair of the group, Dr. Ryan, notes that \"it is well documented that Tusla has not been able to recruit the number of social workers to meet its needs, and is unlikely to be able to do so in the immediate term.\"  He stresses that \"the need for an effective workforce strategy that meets the immediate, as well as long term goals for the organisation cannot be overstated.\"  The report states that Tusla is preparing a multi-annual workforce plan to identify the organisation&rsquo;s personnel requirements for the coming years.  The expert assurance group expects that this plan will provide insight into how the organisation will adapt to labour-market conditions in order to deliver effective services to children.  The report recommends that \"significant engagement with discipline and service leads\" is undertaken to identify the optimum service delivery model.<\/p><p>We welcome the development of a strategic workforce and look forward to reviewing the final document.<\/p><p> A shortage of qualified social work staff is undoubtedly contributing to delays in the appropriate management of referrals and the early assessment of children at risk.  However, Tusla, in conjunction with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, has to manage the same workforce challenges faced by other jurisdictions and avoid an organisational mindset that sees such problems as insurmountable due to factors outside its control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019021300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550050200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dunnion for her opening statement.

What becomes critical is what Tusla is doing to manage the shortage.  There have to be many strategies in place and the first thing to do is to recognise the reality.  It is then necessary to acknowledge that there is an ongoing problem that will not be solved in the next five years.  The first question is whether there is a strategy in place to deal with it.  The finding was that there was not.  The next question was whether it had been ensured the environment of social workers, social care workers and administrative staff was the optimum it could be, by which I mean had it been ensured people were not bogged down in paper and that the process had been streamlined as properly as it could be.  Following on from that question, it is necessary to ask whether Tusla has reviewed the matter critically.  The answer at the time of the statutory investigation was \"No\".  Our next issue was the need for social workers to be confident that the processes optimised what they were doing.  The question then was if the training provided was really robust.  Is there a training programme in place to make sure they know what they are doing, how to do it and that there is support for social workers and social care workers in doing so.  Gaps were also found in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  The most critical aspect - for me anyway - is our role when a new social worker comes to work in Tulsa.  It is a frightening environment in which to work and in which very important decisions are being made.  The main question is whether the person feels safe and the junior social worker is subject to really good supervision.  We found that it was not in place.  It is not a critique that is unfair on individuals.  We are looking at the arrangements in place to make sure the individuals about whom Deputy Sherlock rightly spoke are supported properly.  We found that that was not the case and that there were major opportunities to make improvements.  Throughout our inspection processes to date, we have seen where the position has begun to improve.  That is good, but there is a way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019021300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speech","time":1550050200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dunnion for that answer.

They have been introduced to my colleagues and we will be happy to engage and take questions at the end, and to inform them on any areas I have not covered in the opening statement.  For clarity, we submitted the opening statement as well as a more detailed background report with more information.  I will update the committee on the issues associated with recruitment and how these impact on helping to resolve the recruitment challenges faced by Tusla.  In addition, I will point out some of the initiatives the agency has undertaken to retain staff.  As I said, additional information is in the separate document as well as in Appendix I of this document.<\/p> <p>  Since its establishment in 2014, Tusla has taken a number of significant steps to ensure that it is best placed to recruit and retain social work staff.  However, despite recruiting in excess of 800 posts since 2014, this has only resulted in a 4% increase, just over 60, in overall social work staffing.  The reasons for this are complex and relate to both the supply of social workers as well as the challenge of retaining staff in the area of child protection and welfare services.  When we look at international comparators of social workers to children, the number of child protection social workers per 1,000 children, which is the international comparison we are using, in Ireland it is half of the closest number we found, which is in the UK.  The implication there is that if we were to staff up to UK levels, we would require another 1,500 social workers.  We have approximately 1,500 social workers currently, so it would mean doubling that number.  It shows the challenge we are facing.  Currently, Ireland trains 215 social workers through universities.  In 2018, Tusla recruited 140 social workers.  In a rough calculation, if they are all new social workers, we are getting 65% of the new graduates.  The HSE is also competing for the same cohort of graduates, as well as voluntary sector agencies.  This underlines the challenge.  Ireland is not educating sufficient numbers of social workers to meet service demands for the coming years.<\/p> <p>  In addition, Tusla has invested in strategies to retain staff recruited to the organisation.  While the numbers leaving the agency have fallen somewhat since we have commenced these initiatives, the challenge of the work involved in child protection and welfare means that graduate social workers are attracted to other social work areas having gained the experience and completed a number of years of work in child protection and welfare services.  The solution to the recruitment of social workers and other key staff will take a number of years to resolve and it will require support from the universities, educational institutions and CORU, as well as political support.<\/p> <p>  Some immediate options are being progressed by the agency with partners.  There have been discussions between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and universities about increasing the number of undergraduate places available.  Those discussions are ongoing.  We have trained and developed our staff in a significant initiative, entitled Signs of Safety, which is about the implementation of a national, uniform practice model to ensure staff are sufficiently supported and trained for the very challenging work that is child protection and welfare.  We are commencing the development of a strategy to create multidisciplinary teams who will work alongside social workers to create additional capacity within current resources to manage the delivery of services at the front line.<\/p> <p>  When Tusla was established in 2014, the agency was in more than 400 locations nationally, dealing with more than 43,000 child protection and welfare referrals each year.  In 2018, there were almost 60,000 referrals, a significant increase on previous years.  In respect of child protection services, the agency inherited 17 different areas of practice.  The underlying systems in those were disparate, including five which were exclusively paper-based.  In addition, the agency relied heavily on a memorandum of understanding, MoU, with the HSE for a range of critical services, including human resources and recruitment.  Soon after establishment, it became apparent that Tusla's recruitment requirements could not successfully be met through the MoU as both agencies were seeking to hire the same staff.  When greater financial resources became available in 2016, we commenced the development of our recruitment service, called Tusla Recruit.<\/p> <p>  While child protection and welfare is the main area of our work, we have to deal with many other areas of service.  These inevitably capture often the best skilled, older and more experienced social workers on staff when we need to recruit to those areas.  We have provided a long list of those services but areas such as adoption, separated children seeking asylum, therapy services, homelessness, educational support services, family support, domestic abuse, alternative care regulation, alternative educational assessment and registration and early years service regulation demand experienced social workers and they take social workers away from the child protection and welfare services as well.  These services are supported by other directorates in the organisation.  However, the point is that they are another source of drawing away from the child protection and welfare side.<\/p> <p>  The next point is how recruitment overall as well as social work have increased through the five years of establishment.  Currently, we have just under 3,900 whole-time equivalent, WTE, staff in the organisation, of whom 1,453 are social workers.  In addition, we employ just under 500 agency staff, of whom 226 are social workers and 160 are social care workers.  We can go into detail about the arrangements relating to those later.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note the key achievements since the agency's establishment.  One of the points that consistently comes through in HIQA reports - and we have had some very challenging reports from the authority in terms of services - is that where there has been an immediate risk to children, we have been able to put immediate protective responses in place that keep the child safe.  That is at the core of everything Tusla tries to do - the idea that a child who might be at risk would not get a service because of whatever issues there may be in any part of the organisation is a human issue for any of us - and we have put in processes to ensure that it happens as far as we can make that possible.  There is also the establishment of other areas related to our discussion this morning.  They include Tusla Recruit and central vetting for employees as well as foster carers, Garda vetting and so forth.  We have developed a comprehensive child protection and welfare strategy, which has been informed by all the gaps we have identified over the past number of years such as service gaps, recruitment and the risks that exist.  That strategy has been in process over the past two years and has brought a significant improvement to our services.<\/p> <p>  We have established a child protection notification system, CPNS.  That is part of our automation and investment in information and communications technology, ICT.  In terms of support for families outside our system, the prevention partnership and family support initiative has been a major success.  National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, evaluated that earlier in 2018 and found the initiative to be very strong.  It is about trying to support families and children who are not in care but outside our system and in our attention sphere.  The national childcare information system, NCCIS, went live in July 2018.  For the first time, that brought a single system to child protection systems where the recording of data and the facility to allow social workers to work online on the recording of cases and so forth have been done.  There is still work to do on it but it has been a major step change in our progress.  Programme management as a practice has been brought into many of the changes, including service development, service initiatives and service improvements in which we have been involved, and we have developed a comprehensive ICT strategy and department and enhanced mobility with the workforce in terms of mobile devices and so forth.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly mention the complexity of what social workers do.  In Tusla, the majority of social workers are employed in child protection and welfare in addition to children in care work.  Our goal is always to try to make lives better for children.  In social work cases, we intervene in complex situations where sometimes parents and children experience severe difficulties that have developed over time and require complex solutions.<\/p><p>In addition, we are also constantly balancing the need to intervene effectively in private family life to protect children, but also not to over intervene and damage the autonomy and rights that parents have to a private life, nor to unnecessarily remove children where other alternatives to their safety might exist.  That is where the Signs of Safety process training of social workers has been heavily weighted towards.<\/p><p> We need to move from a culture of blame to a culture of shared responsibility, and the creation of a learning environment for staff, and civic discussion involving children and families that appreciates the complexity of child protection work.  In public discussion, social work decisions are criticised for being overly interventionist, while in other situations for not taking action quickly enough or not intervening enough in families' lives.  That is a challenge that we and social workers at the front end constantly have to balance.<\/p><p> A number of factors influence why social workers leave the profession.  Through international research and Tusla's own consultation process, we know the factors that influence a social worker's decision to leave child protection.  They are as complex as the area of work itself, including issues such as a culture of blame where often the positive work is ignored with a focus instead on the \"bad\" stories.  Such focus leads to a risk-averse culture which, in turn, gives rise to professional decision-making being pushed upwards resulting in micromanagement and low job satisfaction.  Furthermore, social workers, in particular, those in the area of child protection and welfare report higher levels of stress and burnout.  Unfortunately, this can be compounded by overly bureaucratic systems, which reduce the time a social worker spends on direct work and have an impact.  Finally, while we acknowledge and are supportive of the role of inspections, by their nature these focus on areas of deficit.  The absence of commentary on the positive work in an area results sometimes in increased workloads as staff focus on the issues to be sorted rather than on the wider picture.  It decreases consistency.  Staff will leave areas where there are consistently high levels of criticism, .<\/p><p> As for how we are addressing this, we have experienced a small reduction in staff turnover in the 2016 to 2018 period.  Behind that, we have established Tusla Recruit, which is a recruitment service specifically for Tusla.  Up until 2016, we shared panels, recruitment services, etc., with the HSE.  As I stated earlier, the competition for the same resources was never going to leave us in a position where we could get the best recruitment service for the social workers that we wanted and, therefore, we established our own recruitment service.  At present, we handle 98% of our recruitment campaigns.<\/p><p> Through our workforce learning and development programme, we have enhanced training opportunities supporting the continuous professional development provided to social workers, including leadership training, supervision as well as organisation-wide training in Signs of Safety.  Over the past year and a half, we have trained in excess of 2,000 staff in the delivery of that.  There is a comprehensive ongoing programme with that.  It provides a method of work which is relationship and strengths-based and works exclusively with the family and the others who are around the child in the community to create better outcomes for children and it has been widely welcomed and adopted by staff.  It is positively rated by staff as they go through that process.<\/p><p> Through our graduate programme, we have been reaching out across Ireland, Scotland and Northern Ireland to link with universities to try to promote Tusla as a good place to work and, hopefully, as an employer of choice for graduates.<\/p><p> We worked consistently throughout 2018 on the development of a sophisticated workforce plan, which is about trying to develop multidisciplinary teams.  In terms of trying to develop an alternative to the social worker model, we must identify, test and agree what these multidisciplinary teams will look like to ensure that the complexity of the care that one is trying to deliver at the front door is enhanced with care givers other than social workers and social care staff.  That work allows us to capitalise on the other disciplines that we have within the organisation to support the front-line staff but also safeguard not only their time but also the service and the practice.<\/p><p> We have developed a pioneering initiative  for social workers called the empowering practitioners in practice initiative, EPPI, which covers the major themes encountered by them in their daily work.  This toolkit sets out clear and concise mentoring arrangements for social workers who engage in the initiative.<\/p><p> We have provided a large range of family friendly policies.  In social work services, 85% of our employees are female and there is a large demand for term time, career breaks and parental leave.  We have also been proactive in addressing issues of stress and burnout by providing enhanced employee health and well-being programmes and access to a critical incident stress management programme.<\/p><p> We face a number of challenges.  Our demand for social workers is not being met by the supply of graduates from the universities.  We are competing with other sectors for the same cohort of graduates.  Similar to nursing and other professions, the mobility, choice and demographic profile of graduates, who often leave within two years, is very apparent.  Child protection work is seen as the most challenging within the social work profession.  Some of the retention initiatives give rise to recruitment demands.  For example, promotional opportunities and career progression require back-filling, and family friendly policies place additional demands on the teams.  I mentioned the demographic issue.  A total of 100 of the 1,500 social workers are on maternity leave at any time because of the demographic profile of employees.  Delays in the registration of new social workers are something that we have been trying to work through so that new social workers are available and registered faster but there are delays in those at present.  There is also limited access to overseas social workers due to restrictions on visas-work permits for the non-EEA candidate pool.<\/p><p> A number of issues require further development on our part.  We have put them down because we will require support as we move through them.  An important one is access to training pathways for social care workers who wish to train and work as social workers.  That is the idea of having those who work with us on the social care side of the house having some kind of employment-educational model that allows them to train as social workers.  Additional graduate social work training places should be made available.  We have mentioned the idea of a revised pay structure or some type of salary banding which can recognise the particular challenges associated with social workers within the child protection and welfare side.  We have mentioned the need to strengthen the legislative framework on a number of fronts, specifically, section 3 on the retrospective allegations of abuse, which causes significant concern and angst within our services in terms of how to effectively deal with those cases.  Finally, there is communicating and improving a civic understanding and the need for shared responsibility for the care of children in society.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the Tusla story is positive.  We have made significant progress and undertaken much reform since establishment, despite the challenges faced by the agency.  As I have demonstrated, where those challenges fall within our control, we have been proactive and creative in addressing them and we will continue with greater clarity in the context of the workforce plan.

The Deputy is absolutely right that this adds to the attrition from the child protection and welfare side of the house.

The lion's share of social work posts are in the child protection and welfare area.  With the developments within the child protection and welfare service with our national approach to practice and the strategy, many social workers prefer to work within that area with those initiatives.  It is quite important.  With duty and intake teams, many social workers like to return because our service delivery framework is set up in such a way as to try to minimise the number of social workers a child will have in his or her lifetime through his or her journey and care, so children move to the children and care team quite quickly.

One would imagine that if one were working at the coalface of child protection for ten, 15 or 20 years, managing those stress levels would become harder and harder.  Is there a period after which one should leave?  I ask this because if the answer is in the affirmative, that has a bearing on the strategy for graduate recruitment and so on.

We set out in the supporting paper circulated to the committee material on the issues that support retention.  I think that is what the Deputy is talking about.  How do we retain staff to do the complex and challenging work involved?  The Deputy is correct that over the years, regulation has increased in this realm which has put more pressure on staff in terms of their performance on issues, which is good and right in respect of the provision of effective services.  Ultimately, we have found that it is about the ability to make a difference.  It is about staff feeling they have the ability to make a difference and being facilitated to do so.  That is very much the intent behind the child protection and welfare strategy and what we are trying to do with our practice approach there.  High quality supervision keeps people in place.  Individual supervision and, as we have also implemented, group supervision will support people to remain in the service.  Career progression is important.  The Deputy referred earlier to different posts.  We are prioritising senior practitioner posts on the child protection side of our business to try to hold onto people there.

As a social worker my biggest frustration was that I could not get access to services when I had carried out assessments.  Many of these were complex cases that were known to other State agencies and related in particular to young people involved in criminality who had poor mental health status.  As we are a welfare agency they sometimes come back to us without an integrated approach.  There have been some really good developments in Tusla over the past year, including the creative community alternatives.  The feedback from social workers is that it is really good to have a resource at hand at an area level which allows them to engage a young person in an appropriate therapeutic intervention.  We are also on the cusp of rolling out our therapeutic service across the country.  This service was piloted in the Waterford-Wexford area.  We have therapeutic models in our special care service and our national alternative care, AC, service is now a regional service.  It works from a therapeutic model as well.  We have also introduced Signs of Safety.  We are travelling in the right direction to do away with some of the frustrations for social workers and principal social workers, such as trying to access placements or interventions when a young person presents in crisis at, say, 5 p.m. on Friday evening.  The Signs of Safety programme has opened the door to engagement with parents in terms of their concerns and what they consider to be the solutions.  We can help them in that regard.  We can also deal with the safety aspects of the planned intervention.  It is positive to hear practitioners and managers on the front line speak enthusiastically about a new practice model.<\/p> <p>  I chaired child protection conferences for ten years in south Tipperary and I saw that parents were not being considered in the process.  Interventions involved a group of professionals having a conversation at a high level, to which poor mum or dad would agree to get out the door.  How positive was that?  It was not positive in the least.  Was it going to create good outcomes for children?  Not necessarily.  I strongly believe that what we are doing now is moving in the right direction.

The challenge we have is that to share that information with those persons, we must go through a fact-finding or investigation type of process to determine a finding and then share the information.  It is in that space that we are challenged fundamentally, as it is not typically a role the agency would hold.  We are not investigators of these matters.  Where the Garda is involved, it is where the adult complainant wants to progress a criminal matter, but in many of these cases the adult complainant does not want a criminal process.  He or she simply wants the agency to effect the rights of other children potentially at risk.

One of the concerns I have in my capacity when I come across issues, as I do fairly regularly, unfortunately, is how long it takes for the investigation and the fact that there is no communication stream.  It is not the fault of Tusla, which does its job when it gets sufficient evidence and presents it.  It is totally understandable.  In the intervening period, it is often the case that the victim or concerned individual sees nothing and does not hear anything.  The person may ring the Garda but it does not know anything about it and it cannot take action because there is not sufficient evidence.  The problem arises in terms of public confidence in the way in which the system is structured.  The witnesses have clearly identified and, I hope, would provide us with additional information that would be very helpful for us in fulfilling our responsibilities in this equation.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, I can think of something of which we are all perfectly aware in this committee and which we have been dealing with for quite some time.  I will not speak about specific instances but there are cases in the public domain.  Yesterday's interview of a solicitor representing alleged victims of child sex abuse implied that some of these issues were recent, but as far as I am aware, no agency is aware of any recent activity.  That is very problematic, primarily because of Children First, Tusla's role in the equation and the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am very concerned in hearing things like that being said.  When this is condensed, it leads to the assumption that there may be an active individual in a national organisation.  I do not believe there is, but there could be.  The idea that there could be is of massive concern to me and, no doubt, to others.  I am sure it is a matter that somebody in Tusla has considered.  Is it possible for us to plug that gap and do so promptly?  Does the organisation have the personnel to do it?  As we have outlined, Tusla does not have the legislative backing.

Since that time there has been considerable focus within the Department of Health and the HSE on the management and oversight of related operational challenges and strategic priorities and on the implementation of key Government decisions relating to CervicalCheck.<br\/><br\/>Resulting from the Government's desire to assist women and families affected by a lack of disclosure, the Government decided in May to provide a comprehensive package of health and social care supports for the cohort of 221 women and families for whom the audit carried out by CervicalCheck found discordance with the original reading of their slide or slides.  The HSE has an established and stable process in place to ensure that these supports are being provided through designated liaison officers.  In making its decision, the Government also decided that this comprehensive package of supports would be provided to any other woman for whom the independent clinical expert review being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists identified discordance with her original smear test reading.  In its invitation, the committee has referenced women not included in the 221, and I trust this clarifies the position in that regard.  The HSE has recently completed a validation report on the status of the 221 group which has been shared with women and families within the group.  It is intended that this report will assist in ensuring appropriate supports are provided to these women and families.<br\/><br\/>Also in May, the Government decided to establish a scoping inquiry led by Dr. Gabriel Scally.  Dr. Scally's report sets out the impact of non-disclosure on the women and families affected by it as well as providing useful clarity on the limitations of screening and audit.  He set out 50 recommendations aimed at addressing the shortcomings which he identified across a range of areas in screening.<br\/><br\/>In December, following Government approval, an implementation plan for all of the recommendations of the scoping inquiry was published on the website of the Department of Health.  Some of the key elements include continuation of the current dedicated team within CervicalCheck to ensure access to medical records and slides; the inclusion of patient advocates on the HSE board; establishment of a national screening committee; actions to address recommendations on laboratory services and on procurement; the need for mandatory disclosure, which is addressed within the forthcoming patient safety Bill; establishment of an independent patient safety council, which will as its first action undertake a review of open disclosure policies; a number of actions to be led by the National Cancer Registry addressing data sharing, data definitions and collection of patient level details between it and the NSS, as well as governance; and establishment of an expert group within the HSE to review clinical audit processes across all cancer screening programmes, in which process patient advocates will be included.<br\/><br\/>I have referred to the independent clinical expert review which is being led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists following a Government decision on 8 May 2018.  Expertise for this review is also being sourced through the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.  The review includes women who were part of the CervicalCheck audit and women who were not.  Specifically, the scope of the review includes cases of invasive cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established, or approximately 3,000 cases, up to May 2018.  These 3,000 cases includes the 1,482 cases which were notified to CervicalCheck since 2008.  These women's screening histories were audited by CervicalCheck once it had been notified of their cancer diagnosis, and through that process the 221 were identified for whom there was discordance with their original results.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the cases notified to CervicalCheck, a further approximately 1,600 cases were not notified to, and therefore not audited by, CervicalCheck.  Some of these women had been screened prior to diagnosis.The independent clinical expert review encompasses those women within the overall group of approximately 3,000 who were screened by the programme prior to diagnosis, or approximately 1,700 women who are currently contactable and comprehended by the review following a detailed validation process.<br\/><br\/>Where the expert panel's opinion of cytology results differs from the original results provided by CervicalCheck, the panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage and will prepare individual reports for those affected, setting out the facts and the panel's expert and independent assessment of those facts.  The review will also produce an aggregated report which will be provided to the Minister and which is to include recommendations, where appropriate, with the aim of improving care for women.<br\/><br\/>A consent process has been undertaken over recent months, following an extensive process of validation of data.  The HSE has advised that more than 1,070 women have consented to take part in the review.  This is approximately 63%, which is a welcome level of uptake and will facilitate the production of a robust aggregated report.  The expert review panel has been provided with colposcopy and other data from CervicalCheck in respect of women who have consented to participate, and the transfer of slides to the review laboratory has begun.  The royal college has indicated a timeframe of at least six months to complete the review.<br\/><br\/>The Government agreed on 18 December to establish an independent statutory tribunal, chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine.  Primary legislation will be required to establish the tribunal.  Mr. Justice Meenan provided the Government with detailed recommendations on the establishment of the tribunal and the Department has been working intensively on the drafting of a general scheme.  The required legislation is legally novel in providing for the determination of liability outside a traditional court setting.  It is expected that the general scheme will be submitted to Government shortly for approval to draft the Bill.  This Bill is a Government priority and is therefore included in the spring legislative programme.  The Department is also working on the operational elements on the tribunal's establishment, including securing premises.<br\/><br\/>Separately, the Minister also confirmed in December that, in advance of the establishment of the tribunal, he would examine the early establishment of a non-statutory scheme to provide <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments to the women who were affected by the non-disclosure of results of the retrospective audit.  The development of this draft scheme is in progress in the Department in advance of going to Government.  The Department is aware that these are issues to which the utmost priority attaches, and it is working speedily to ensure their completion.<br\/><br\/>In his final report, Dr. Scally emphasised that continuation of cervical screening was of crucial importance.  His report affirmed that the lifetime risk of a woman in Ireland getting cervical cancer was 1 in 135 in 2015, compared with 1 in 96 in 2007, representing a substantial improvement since the programme commenced.  The HSE undertook detailed negotiations in the latter half of 2018 to extend the contracts of existing laboratory service providers to ensure continuation of screening.  Dr. Scally also stated in his report that improved screening uptake, the new HPV testing regime, and the extension of the HPV vaccine to boys together create a realistic prospect of the virtual elimination of cervical cancer in Ireland in the coming decades.  These are a key focus for the Department and the HSE in 2019.  In parallel, and interlinked with these priorities, the management of current capacity issues remains a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Damien McCallion, national director of screening services; Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the women's and infants' programme; and Dr. Lorraine Doherty, clinical director from CervicalCheck.<\/p> <p>  Our focus continues to be on supporting women and their families who were impacted by the CervicalCheck crisis.  We have continued to provide a wide range of supports in line with those agreed with the Department of Health.  These have included the provision of 602 medical cards and the upgrading of eligibility for another 91 medical card holders, provision of access to a broad range of HSE and HSE-funded supports, and the reimbursement of &euro;1.2 million in expenses and costs to those affected.  In addition, we recently completed a detailed piece of work that updated the information on the group of 221 patients.  This was done in conjunction with the 221+ patient representative group and will help inform the provision of future supports for the group of 221 patients.  We also continue to support women and their families in the provision of access to their records and ensuring women get their slides from laboratories where required for legal review.  A new client services unit was established in our national screening service to support this process.  A total of 109 out of 118 slide requests have been dealt with in 25 days on average, and there are only nine requests still being processed.<\/p> <p>  We continue to support the independent international expert panel review being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, which was established by the Minister for women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HSE supported the consent process which has seen 1,072 women or their next of kin consent to participation out of an eligible group of 1,702.  This included establishing a national help desk, developing an eligible data set with the National Cancer Registry, and implementation of a client management system to support the RCOG.  In recent weeks, the laboratories have commenced the transfer of slides.  All slides have been transferred by the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.<\/p><p>Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare have also commenced the transfer process with the imaging of slides for transfer, and a transfer schedule is being agreed this week with those laboratories.<\/p><p> We remain concerned at the length of time being taken to report cervical smears, which is on average at 93 days although it can take up to 27 weeks for the report to be provided.  There is currently a backlog of approximately 78,000 slides.  In 2018, around 370,000 women presented to the programme, which was an increase from 280,000 in 2017.  This increase of approximately 90,000 was a result of the uptake of the out of cycle smear test and more women presenting to the programme, which would in normal circumstances be a positive step.  We have worked with existing private providers, other private providers and public service providers in other countries to try to grow our laboratory capacity.  Some of our existing providers have managed to reduce the wait times and we continue to work with others to try to find additional capacity.  While we continue to pursue active leads, this has proved very challenging due to the global shortage in cytology.  This has been caused as a result of the reduced cytology requirement as countries implement HPV primary screening which leads to a reduction of 80% for cytology requirements.  We are actively trying to identify possible solutions that will help reduce the wait times which we know are causing a lot of anxiety for women.<\/p><p> As part of the laboratories' quality assurance process, we were also made aware of an issue with regard to HPV tests expiration at Quest Diagnostics.  While the clinical risk was deemed very low, we have contacted all those affected and a number of women are being retested.  These tests will be expedited by Quest Diagnostics to ensure a timely response for those women requiring a retest.  A key risk to enabling cervical screening to continue in Ireland was the extension of the laboratory contracts.<\/p><p> The HSE has a signed agreement with one of the private providers and is working through the detail on a contract with the second provider with whom we have a heads of agreement.  We also made a strategic decision to develop a national cervical screening laboratory in conjunction with the Coombe Woman and Infants University Hospital.  This included an initial capital allocation of &euro;5 million to progress the development of the laboratory.  A project team and steering group has been put in place to oversee all aspects of this project.  While this will take some time to develop, it will provide a better balance between public and private provision of laboratory services to the cervical screening programme.<\/p><p> The HSE is progressing plans to introduce HPV primary screening.  A project team is in place and is progressing the various work streams.  We have completed a review of international HPV primary screening implementation, and ICT testing is under way.  The development of education and training materials has commenced, and our procurement team has started the tender process for laboratory services, with a pre-tender market engagement session held before Christmas.  We remain committed to implementing HPV primary screening as soon as possible.<\/p><p> The HSE has contributed significantly to the development of an implementation plan in collaboration with other State agencies in response to the Scally review recommendations.  We have appointed a senior manager to oversee the implementation and established a HSE implementation oversight group, jointly chaired by our chief clinical officer and deputy director general for operations.  We have developed a set of 94 actions arising from recommendations that are the responsibility of the HSE to implement.  Examples of progress to date include key appointments and governance changes.  An organisational review of risk management structures has also been commissioned by the HSE in addition to the establishment of an expert group within the national screening service to review clinical audit processes across all screening programmes.  An interim revision of the HSE's open disclosure policy has commenced and will be communicated and implemented throughout the system pending a more detailed review during 2019.  The HSE has also reviewed and updated its financial records management policy.  All six recommendations from Dr. Scally's interim report have been fully implemented.  The HSE has maintained open communication with patient representatives on the implementation plan and will continue to work collaboratively with them throughout 2019.<\/p><p> The HSE has continued to strengthen the governance and management of screening services.  We have established an interim management team with the reassignment of senior people to key positions while we fill key positions on a permanent basis.  We have recently appointed a director of public health, a CervicalCheck clinical director and a CervicalCheck laboratory quality assurance lead.  In addition, a risk committee for our screening services, which is independently chaired, has been put in place since quarter 3 of 2018.  An interim quality and risk manager was also appointed in quarter 3, and the implementation of Dr Scally's recommendations on strengthening our quality assurance processes has commenced.  I assure members of the committee that the HSE is focused on stabilising the cervical screening programme to enable us to progress the introduction of a new enhanced HPV primary screening testing methodology.  All possible resources are being directed at this challenge.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I have one or two questions and then we will go to the members in order.

As the experts in the area, will the witnesses say who was advising the Minister before the offer was made?  What discussions and consultations were held, specifically on the availability of resources?  Clearly, we now have a backlog which can be traced in part to that announcement.

As the Vice Chairman said, the context was very much the anxiety among interested parties and on the part of concerned women who were ringing the helpline seeking clarity.  There was a great deal of anxiety.  There was undoubtedly a situation in which women who could afford to do so were going to present at their GPs while women who could not afford to do so might not.  The Minister had, therefore, to make a rapid decision.  Negotiations on a fee took place with the IMO and the option to consult their GPs was provided to women.  If, following a consultation, a woman and her family doctor decided to have a retest, that was paid for.  That was the context.  Officials were involved in the decision and provided the Minister with the advice I have outlined.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of resources, it is fair to say that in all of our discussions with the HSE during 2018 on foot of the CervicalCheck controversy, we were quick to put any resources in place that were required.  Financial provision around the measures that had to be put in place to respond to the controversy was rapidly deployed and the HSE was in constant contact with us on costs, all of which were met over the course of 2018.  The issue arising in this situation is not one of financial resources but of the ability to leverage additional capacity.  The HSE can speak to the substantial amount of work it has done to increase the capacity of the screening programme.  It continues to work in that regard, but there are constraints.<\/p> <p>  It was difficult to quantify when making the decision what the exact uptake of retests would be.  We now know the level of uptake.  The interest and anxiety around CervicalCheck continued for a protracted period which undoubtedly fed into that.  It is worth noting that the finalisation of the Scally report allowed for clarity around the issue.  However, the report took longer than was originally envisaged.  There was a period while Dr. Scally was looking at the laboratories and doing his work when retests continued.  As the Minister said in the House last week, he took further advice once the Scally report was completed.  That advice led him to write to the HSE to say it was an appropriate time to bring retesting to an end.  The HSE advised that while it would do so, the end of December should be the cut-off point as tests were scheduled into that month for women.  That has now taken place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>According to media reports at the weekend, senior people in the HSE advised against this.

Regarding the backlog, while there is some variation between laboratories in terms of what is there, we have prioritised colposcopy, which is the highest risk group, across the laboratories, and clear instructions and guidance were given on that.  In addition, where one of the laboratories had pressure, we authorised what is called co-testing, where we ran the HPV test first, which allowed us to triage and ensure we were taking out the smears that have the highest risk.  They are mitigation steps we have taken to try to reduce that risk.<\/p> <p>  The other group is women who are on short recalls.  Deputy Kelly asked this question previously.  We are working through trying to find the technology solution that might help to accelerate those.  We do not have that at the moment but we believe we will be able to do something around that.  We have tried to mitigate the at-risk groups as best we can within the context of how the programme functions to minimise that risk Deputy Donnelly has described in terms of what is there.

However, having said that, of course, women in that group, in the 80,000, will have abnormal smears.  As I have said here previously, the natural history of cervical cancer is that there is a lead-in time of ten to 15 years.  Most of those women who have abnormal smears will be a long way from developing cervical cancer but there will inevitably be some women who are nearer the stage of transitioning from pre-invasive to invasive.

Mr. McCallion told me that, essentially, there was no way to reprioritise or to distinguish totally in this respect.  The delay is now 27 weeks.  It was 24 weeks, and we were told by the Minister it had gone down to 22 weeks, but now it back up to 27 weeks.  Dr. McKenna might explain why that is the case?<\/p> <p>  With short recalls versus routine smears versus those who are going for reassurance tests, the issue of the prioritisation of women is a concern.  Let us be responsible about this.  I agree with Dr. McKenna that when it is broken down, there is a low risk but there is a risk and it is accentuated for a small number of women because of the 27-week delay given they are further along the path and the transition from non-invasive to invasive.  It is at the critical juncture.  If one is caught in that 27-week delay because one is at that point of going from one stage to the other, that is a problem.  There is no point in saying otherwise; it is an issue.  It is a consequence of decision-making and all of that.  I am not apportioning blame; that is not what I am getting at, but there is a concern in terms of how rapidly the delay is tackled because it creates risk.  I have been told of cases of women who are probably at the point where they are moving from one stage to the other and this delay has now pushed on their diagnosis after having had a smear test.  There is a concern about the impact of this disease on their health and the risk.  The consequence for their health is worse because of this.  I accept it is low risk.

This is because of the general trend away from cytopathology and into HPV testing.  Dr. McKenna may want to comment on this as well.  Having said that, we will offer more opportunities in terms of the Coombe - the public system.  What most countries have done is try to train people in order that they can operate both HPV and cytology and they obtain both skill sets.  That has been the model.  From our experience of looking at HPV implementation in other countries, that is one of the lessons.  We will try to build that into our workforce plan in the context of screening.  While, as I say, it is small in terms of numbers, we will do whatever it takes to ensure we provide career paths and skills for people and that they can operate within that.  Equally, we will have to look when we go to tender at ensuring that whoever we work with will be able to maintain those skill sets and have sufficient capacity that can deal with fluctuations because we have had previous fluctuations in the programme.  The Chair referred to the Jade Goody effect some years ago.  In that period, significant backlogs emerged as well.  This can happen in the future.

In some ways, unfortunately, it is simple.  First, the demand is continuing to be slightly higher, although it has abated somewhat from the peak at which it would have been.  Second, the capacity is constrained.  Without going back over the earlier pieces, we are trying to source all possible capacity with existing providers - those who are currently working with the programme where it is much easier to, for want of a better phrase, connect them in.  We are also looking outside.  We have done a trawl of the market.  We have also talked to other jurisdictions - Northern Ireland and Scotland - and we are in contact with some of the trusts in England which would operate this service to see what capacity is available.  Unfortunately, it is not merely a simple plug-in for a new provider.  There is quite a lot of work involved and there is a lead-in time to do that.

Women were ringing the helpline to say that and to ask for the State to pay for out-of-cycle testing.  We were faced with a situation whereby some women would be able to afford to pay for private testing but others would not.  The decision was made in a rapidly developing situation.  We agreed with the IMO that a fee would be paid to GPs for the sampling.  In quite a high proportion of cases, women met their GPs, had a conversation and arrived at the conclusion that they did not need another test.  The programme put in place was of great benefit in terms of reassuring people.  Some women, in consultation with their GPs, decided to have another test.  In fairness, at that point many people in addition to civil servants and the Minister, such as commentators and people directly affected by the controversy, believed it was the right thing to do.  In trying to respond to the anxiety which existed, it would have been just as big a mistake to be totally dispassionate and hard headed and decide there was no need for the measures.

While the witnesses cannot give a date, I am very conscious that on 10 October, Dr. Denton, the lady from Scotland who was here with Dr. Scally, said that from the inception of the idea of bringing in HPV testing, theoretically, the system could be up and running within a year.  Are we on target?  Can the witnesses give some information on that?<\/p> <p>  We have a backlog of screening, an issue that was dealt with this morning.  In terms of knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer, reference was made to the Jade Goody effect ten years ago, when she tragically died at a very young age from cervical cancer and there was a massive uptake of the cervical programme in the UK and Ireland.  In light of all that has happened, is it true that more women in the cohort are engaging and are more aware?  We heard from the victims but also the medical evidence that there were gaps in people's information and perhaps there was an over-reliance on smears without consideration of symptoms such as bleeding and discomfort.  Perhaps one of the witnesses could speak to that point.<\/p> <p>  To go back to HPV testing, there will be a transition period from the current CervicalCheck programme to the more robust, more accurate, but not perfect HPV screening, and Dr. McKenna mentioned it would require 15% cytology.  In terms of our lab capacity, I am very conscious of Quest Diagnostics.  While I did not bring Dr. Scally's report with me this morning, there was an issue with the ISO accreditation in those labs and how Quest in particular had accredited itself to an American standard over the ISO standard.  When it comes to the transition to HPV testing, my question is whether we can, as a committee, be sure the contracts will be correct and that in regard to those who get the contracts, whether in Ireland or elsewhere, there will be no discrepancy between the standards in the contract and the standards in the labs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#P00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I will deal with the patient safety council.

As somebody who sometimes works in the community and engages a lot with people in community health, I would point out to the committee that there was significant demand when there was an information vacuum.  People with private health insurance were presenting in private clinics in the early days of this scandal offering to pay for a smear test to be done.  Regardless of whether it was right or wrong, the logic of it was it was their free choice to do that.  I know many women who paid.  I supported the idea of that reassurance smear being offered.  At the time, a class gap was forming.  In an information vacuum and when we were all, and still are, up to our necks in this and it was very stressful for all of the witnesses, members of the committee and the public, a two-tier system had emerged where some women who could afford it were presenting in private clinics, while other women with the medical card or who did not have the means were feeling somehow disenfranchised.  Hindsight is wonderful and we would all love to have it.  Looking at this through the lens of all the information we have now is fine but as somebody who was engaging with groups of women and GPs, I can tell the committee that a massive discrepancy was arising between the types of people who were or were not getting a free smear test.  Although in hindsight, it may have contributed to the backlog, if we had not done it at the time, it would have been a far more stressful situation for women and would have increased the amount of fear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#Q00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>We can see part of the reassurance and taking some of the stress out in the difference between the number of women who had a consultation with their GP and the number who went on to have the re-test.

As I understand it, and this is not a perfect understanding, there are essentially four steps.  There is the capacity of general practitioners to meet women for a consultation and do the smear tests.  There is then cytology, which involves looking at the cells on a screen and carrying out a HPV test afterwards if abnormalities are detected.  I understand that if the test is clear, a clear test result will be sent back to the GP and the woman will meet her GP, or maybe the results are sent directly to the woman.  If it the test is not clear, colposcopy is then involved, which means the woman will see a consultant gynaecologist, a specialist in colposcopy, who will do an examination and take a biopsy.  That biopsy will then go to a histopathologist who is a consultant doctor and a multidisciplinary team will take it on from there.  I am sure there is much more complexity but the clinical specialties and capacity needed are general practice, cytology laboratories, colposcopy and histopathology.  I am sure there is considerable specialty and complexity around that.<\/p> <p>  We know there are issues of capacity in general practice.  Will the witnesses identify where the choke points are?  This goes back to the six-month delay.  Is it that women cannot get to see GPs quickly enough?  Is it that the cytology laboratories are holding samples and cannot put them through quickly enough?  Does the delay arise when abnormalities are detected and there is referral to a colposcopist?<\/p> <p>  Dr. McKenna noted, although not in relation to cervical cancer, that there are between 28,000 and 30,000 people awaiting a gynaecology outpatient appointment.

That is not in any way to minimise the impact of those who have died or, indeed, the impact of those who are suffering from complications of treatment, but the majority are alive and well due to the fact that the programme identified them at an early stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#V01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter McKenna"},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":766,"content":"<p>We know that the number of women dying of cervical cancer has dropped, but is there any way of measuring the number of women who were screened, whose pre-existing condition was identified and who subsequently were treated successfully?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#V01600","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":767,"content":"<p>We have that data.

Although I am very supportive of boys also getting the vaccine in September, it is very important to not take the eye off the girls because it will not work out if we do not keep the pressure on with the uptake among girls.  I assume there is a robust team in place for marketing and awareness around the HPV vaccine to parents and for boys so that we do not end up in the type of situation previously that left a door open for people to attack the vaccine as a of waste money.  I spoke at length with Professor Ian Frazer, a co-creator of the vaccine in Australia, about the barriers they came up against in terms of prejudice and scaremongering and about the savings to be made by using the 9-valent HPV vaccine, where two strains also deal with genital warts.  The positives of using this vaccine is that younger boys tend to respond very well to knowing that a particular vaccine can stop a visible sexually transmitted infection, STI.  Are we ready to go with the process of bringing in the boys' vaccine and are we definitely doing it right?

I think that Dr. David Gibbons resigned over this because he felt so strongly about this.  As resignations are not that common, we need to take heed of it and maybe not just pass it over.

It is a public servant's job to give advice and recommendations but at the end of the day a Minister and Cabinet made that decision.

One of the concerns I have is that there is a general concern about screening.  The Minister said as much last week.  Looking at the inverse care law, the cohort which may, because of their circumstances, be the most likely to have a difficulty may be the least likely to take the free test.  Looking beyond the reassurance and the strategy that was in place, has there been a look back on previous smears and the risk that may have been attached to a particular person's clinical characteristics?  Do they need to be notified about future tests?  Someone who may not have taken up the opportunity of having a free test may in fact be the person who requires it based on their own clinical backgrounds.  I know that is a complex piece of work.  Perhaps Dr. Scally is examining it, or perhaps there is no necessity to do it.<\/p><p> Has a risk profile been developed to determine what is an urgent smear and what is not?

It will be rolled out in September of this year.<\/p> <p>  The decision to carry out retests was made by the Minister based on professional advice, and we have been through that issue over the course of the morning.  The Minister received advice, including the advice of the Chief Medical Officer.  We could speculate on the inverse care law, but there are a couple of things we should consider.  Without the State saying that it would fund a consultation, those with the means to do so would have participated and others without the means would probably have been least likely to participate.  The fact that the State provided funding equalised things to some degree.  It also must be considered that there is quite a fall-off between the number that had consultations with their GPs who then went on to take a test.  It seems that the very fact that they were reassured was sufficient for them at that stage.  Ultimately, if people did not come forward, get a retest or go to their GP, the programme still has those people and will continue to call them for uptake.  They are still within the programme; it is not the case that they have fallen out of it.  They will still be in the programme and called according to the timescale set out therein.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":880,"content":"<p>In terms of the European guidelines, while it would have been an input into the previous quality assurance, QA, standards, one of the actions from Dr. Scally's recommendations is to update the QA standards in line with best practice, which would include the European guidelines, and look at those in other jurisdictions as well.  That is also being done from two perspectives.  The first is the current programme and the second is another process for HPV testing which is now under way and which will require a new QA model.<\/p> <p>  The standard turnaround for tests before the crisis was 17 days, and covered the period from when the slide went to the laboratory to when results were supplied to the GP or the patient.  We are clearly some way from that turnaround level at the moment, and the challenge of addressing it was what we discussed this morning.  We need to find more capacity to address the backlog that is in place.  In terms of risk mitigation, we have prioritised the colposcopy clinics where there is clearly a need to read those smears much earlier.  We are working on solutions which address the point the Deputy made about clinical backgrounds.  A woman in a programme could be on a six month, one year, three year or five year recall, and that, in some way, reflects the risk to the woman.  We are looking at whether a technological solution could be developed in this area.  It is quite complex.  Unfortunately the group for six months to one year recalls has a higher risk profile than the normal three to five year recalls.  In addition, we had concerns about one of our laboratories, which had a quantum of the backlog, and so we sanctioned the use of HPV testing as a way of triaging the situation.  By running them through HPV screenings those smears that were perhaps in a higher risk category were identified and moved to cytology much earlier.  Those are the sorts of actions we have taken to try to mitigate the risk, while still trying to find capacity to get us to a stable point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":881,"content":"<p>For those on a six month cycle of smear testing, is it possible that some of them could be waiting six months for the outcome of their tests?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#Z00600","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":882,"content":"<p>That is a risk at the moment, and we are trying to address it by putting in some sort of solution that would identify those cases in some way.

Last month I provided a detailed briefing to the Policing Authority in public on the various problems we discovered with the youth referral system.  I do not wish to repeat myself or to take up the committee&rsquo;s time unnecessarily, but it is important that I place on the record of the Houses of the Oireachtas and with this committee the key points from that briefing.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I repeat that I apologise to the more than 3,000 individual and corporate victims we have let down.  They expected us to pursue the crimes committed against them to the fullest extent possible and in their cases we did not do this.  Each and every one of these crimes should have been investigated.  The public expects that if something is reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it will be investigated.  I expect the same.<\/p> <p>  We also let society down by not fully pursuing these crimes, some of them serious, committed by young people.  I also apologise to those young people whom we also we let down.  A great majority of these in the main were vulnerable children who had committed crimes in the past and would commit further crimes.  We should have done better by them at the time.<\/p> <p>  Before I get into the detail of the problem, it is important to say that while our examination has found serious issues with how some crimes committed by young people were processed and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this should not take away from the significant and important work that has been done and is still being done by the Garda youth diversion programme.  It both prevents crime and protects communities, and has steered thousands of young people and children away from crime and anti-social behaviour.  Almost two thirds of the children receiving an informal or formal caution as their first caution under the diversion scheme do not reoffend.  This has been a major benefit to the individuals, their families and society at large.<\/p> <p>  Rather than going through the remainder of the opening statement, I would like to refer to the slides and provide an explanation of them.  In An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we had an examination team in place.  It was headed by Mr. Paul Clearly, who is with us.  It examined the period from July 2010 to July 2017.

As we work down the slide, it can be seen that just more than 100,000 of the referrals were deemed suitable for the diversion programme but also that just more than 55,000 referrals were deemed not suitable for it.  It is within this group we have identified the issues.  Of these 55,000, some 33,000 progress to a child being either charged or summons.  Of the remainder, some 22,000, there is no evidence of an associated charge or summons on PULSE.  When we examine that, there is an explanation for the majority of those, but in 7,894 cases we are saying that these were not appropriately progressed.  That is 5% of the overall referrals.  We can go right to the top figure but we do not wish to diminish this because these 7,894 referrals relate to 3,489 separate children.  This is a matter of some consequence.  Although we were dealing with big figures, whenever we get it wrong, any percentage in this respect means there is a large number of individuals engaged in this matter.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the next slide dealing with the impact on victims.  There were 2,492 individual personal victims and 988 either organisational or business-type victims.  As it states, some of these victims may have received a letter stating that a person had been identified in respect of an offence that had been reported.  We also categorise the majority of the 73% of these crimes, which fall into four common crime categories of public order, theft, traffic or criminal damage, but there were serious crimes also alleged, one incident of rape, one incident of a sexual offence which was a sexual assault, one incident of child neglect and also others, including threats to kill, cultivation of cannabis and violent disorder.  We would assess that the impact on the victims is profound.  Even what we might regard as commonplace crimes can have a very heavy impact on individual victims.  In our approach to this we have been very concerned in the way we approach and deal with this matter with victims.<\/p> <p>  Each victim, as appropriate, is receiving a letter specific to his or her case.  I have moved on to the slide dealing with support for victims.  The letter includes an apology.  We have also provided contact details for the local Garda victims service office and the independent crime victims helpline.  The victims are also given an option, if they receive a letter, of a personal visit by the local Garda team.  We had a helpline which was open for two weeks and it received 35 calls and 16 emails.  The victims of what people are judging to have been serious crimes are receiving a personal visit and this process is ongoing.  So far, we have conducted 47 personal visits.  Also, 4,567 letters have been sent out to victims, but we have also decided in a further 1,600 cases not to send a letter at the district level.  That has been decided on the basis of the case.  That has been in respect of the difficulty in identifying a victim with whom to engage.<\/p> <p>  We are also anxious not to revictimise people.  In some cases we have ongoing engagement with these victims in various fora.  We are very careful that we do not retraumatise or revictimise any individual.  This is very much dealt with on a case-by-case, almost bespoke, response, as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the impact on young people.  As I have said, 3,489 children were associated with referrals not appropriately progressed.  The vast majority of these children had a history of reoffending, which meant they had a lot of contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before and after the incident that was not appropriately progressed.<\/p><p>Each of the children, if he or she is now an adult, or his or her guardian or parent, as appropriate, will receive a letter setting out the impact of the issue on them.  That is ongoing.  District officers have been speaking to parents and guardians in respect of the children as well.<\/p><p> The next slide concerns significant reduction and relates to 2017.  As members will see from the bar chart and the line that runs through it, 96% of cases where there was a failure to act or where the cases were not appropriately actioned happened between 2010 and 2015.  PULSE update 6.8 in November 2015, by and large, addressed the feedback loop in respect of those referrals.  That is backed up by a subsequent update of PULSE, 7.3, and that makes a very significant difference.  Even before we start our examination of this, system changes which we brought in on the back of an examination by the inspectorate to our overall investigatory processes had addressed this problem in terms of the feedback loop and significantly reduced the issue, but we have continued to focus on it, as one would expect.<\/p><p> The next slide sets out what those actions have been in terms of further action taken.  There were further PULSE additions, in particular 7.3 in February 2018 and the extra supervision that brings.  A new monitoring system for all youth referrals was introduced in November 2018.  For the first time a national bureau for child diversion was established in December 2018 and a chief superintendent has been assigned to the bureau on a full-time basis.  Staffing in the bureau was increased throughout 2018 and the staffing complement will be further increased in 2019.<\/p><p> Overall, in the organisation in 2018, there was a good increase in the number of sergeants and inspectors who were available for front-line supervision.  Last month, in January 2019, new standard operating procedures for youth referrals were introduced, together with e-learning on the youth referral process.  As of yesterday, 1,850 members had completed that process and we intend to make sure that the process is fully rolled out next week.  This week an assistant commissioner was appointed on a full-time basis to the community engagement unit, which includes the youth diversion programme.  The youth diversion programme will be subject to internal audit in the coming years.  Overall, the youth diversion programme has worked well for many young people.  It has brought major benefits to individuals and society.  We hope we have enhanced and strengthened the system to make sure that this cannot happen again.<\/p><p> In terms of individual accountability, over the course of seven years, 3,414 Garda members were associated with not appropriately progressing referrals.  Of those, 184 are no longer serving in the organisation.  All referrals not progressed properly have been sent to the relevant divisional officer for them to consider in respect of discipline regulations.  The process is ongoing.  We will pay close attention to it and gather data.  We will keep the committee and the Policing Authority updated.  General guidance on disciplinary processes and penalties has been provided to all divisional officers, but that is a process for which they are responsible.  Discipline in this matter is delegated to them and it comes under their responsibility to determine on the individual considerations in respect of discipline.<\/p><p> This is an interim report and in some ways we have only got to the halfway mark in that we have been able to describe what the problem is and what we can do to fix it.  That is now in place.  We now know the scale of the task in terms of engaging with the victims, and that process is ongoing.  We understand the scale of the task in terms of addressing our organisational and individual accountability, which is ongoing and not finished yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019021300002#D01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":914,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

Approximately 55 have been categorised as very serious crimes and three have been identified as rape, sexual assault and child neglect.  These are extremely serious offences.

Have we not got to the point where other systems that moved to this type of arrangement are looking at bringing this back into Garda control or police control?  One of the problems, I am led to believe - again, this comes back to respecting dignity and a code of ethics - is that the staff involved, some of whom have 20 and 30 years' service, are being given their new terms and conditions this week, being told to sign up by 22 February and that they are moving from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the civilian side of the organisation.  That certainly does not sound like respect and dignity.  In addition, it raises questions about the chain of evidence and about highly skilled staff being lost, with their level of training not being replicated under the new system, and with all of this being sold and justified under the guise of civilianisation.  While we would like to have civilianisation, we might end up with something more expensive and with a loss of significant expertise, never mind treating staff poorly in the interim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019021300002#K00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>There is quite a bit I can say about that but I think I should address it in a written response.

With regard to the report, I want to touch on an angle that has not been touched on.  We are aware of the fact juvenile liaison officers are doing some good work around the country steering young people away from crime.  However, this controversy has probably thrown light on the young people who are falling through the cracks, in particular those who are deemed unsuitable for the programme and, thus, left out of it.  There seems to be a large number of such people, with 55,500 deemed unsuitable for the diversion programme, and the figure of 7,894 came out of that.<\/p> <p>  There is wide acceptance that these people need our help most, although I am not saying it is easy to make it happen.  In the past few days I was talking to a guy involved in the intervention and prevention programme in Ballyogan, which I believe is doing great work with young people, some of whom are very troubled.  The expression he used was that they are prepared to get \"down and dirty\" and work with the kids, listen to them and bring them under their wing, see what the kids are interested in, and steer them away from a life of crime, with many of them having come from troubled backgrounds.  Is there potential for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to work with a large cohort of these 55,000 young people who are not deemed suitable at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019021300002#K01200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>This is over a seven-year period.

We engage with many youth programmes through community policing and through the various services we provide.  However, a lot of the heavy interaction in terms of the time and resources required probably sits better with agencies other than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We can certainly have an input and we can direct individuals towards that, in particular those who are engaged in behaviour which is self-destructive in terms of recidivism.  We do a lot of that through the juvenile diversion programme.

I am not sure it is an issue of resources.  In providing overall youth services other agencies are better placed to lead.  It is not just about providing alternatives to being on the street but also about progression in the careers or qualifications young people might pursue.  That is not solely a job for the Garda.

That is the context.  I would be concerned about a draft report.  I understand the logic in terms of discipline and similar issues, and they are important.  I will not go down the same route as Deputy Clare Daly, however, because she has exhausted that line of question to a large extent.

Earlier we referred to previous reports and PULSE being an instant recording process.  The line of sight of people at various different levels was not what it should have been.  A superintendent, for example, did not have a view of all of the prosecutions.  We are talking big numbers in this context: hundreds of thousands.  That was one of the key weaknesses of the system at that particular time.  This fed into the issue we are dealing with here.  PULSE 6.8 was such a change because it began to provide supervisors at all levels with the information they required to fulfil their roles and obligations with regard to governance.  While we have policy makers at the centre, the people with responsibility were at district and divisional level.  These cases - and we see some 158,000 cases now - were only since the IT system was brought to bear.  It was only at the end of 2015 that we provided the facility for people at district and divisional levels to have oversight and proper governance of it.  There has been considerable change and improvement.  We have also enhanced the role of the national bureau to provide a specific resource for governance on a national level also.

If a serious crime is reported, there is a formal engagement but when a basic matter is reported - which may not be a serious crime - people feel that the crime they have reported is just lost.  They do not know if the investigation is closed, if there is no end to it or what the outcome is.  There could be an accountability process from the public's side where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should develop a public awareness initiative to encourage people to check where their reported crime is at on the system so they know.  This would provide an internal change for an ongoing and active awareness that there is movement on a case or that a case may need to be closed because the intelligence or information cannot be had.  This could be the general feedback that people receive.  It could be a burglary, for example, and there may be nothing for garda&iacute; to act on.  Alternatively there may be information that it is fed into an intelligence-led operation against a particular cohort, but the garda&iacute; cannot act upon it immediately.  It is better for the victim to know this.  This lack of feedback could be some of the negative drift that is sometimes laid at the feet of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which may not be fair, but feedback would allow some external level of accountability where the public can have input so it can know an outcome, even if is not a final one.

There has been a lot of political controversy around the Stepaside Garda station, and rightly so.

We do not have drugs units in some areas while there may be historical retention of drugs units in other areas that do not have the same issues with drugs.  What is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na doing to recalibrate numbers of garda&iacute; within divisions to appropriately address the crime levels there?  Is the Garda looking at levels of response times across divisions and allocating garda&iacute; on that basis?  I speak with garda&iacute; who have said they may not envy the garda&iacute; at a particular station in a division, but there are other stations in sleepy places that do not have the same levels of crime.  I would not like to take garda&iacute; away from areas with low levels of crime, but I want to know what is being done because it is an issue for the Garda as a national force.  How do we apportion numbers properly so that areas with poorer response times get the units or numbers required?

It has been suggested some of the difficulty that arose in these instances was due to the fact that there was, at one point, a centralised system in which all of the names of the relevant young people and juveniles were kept.  I accept that that system was replaced for potentially good reasons by one which required dialogue between the juvenile liaison officer and the arresting officer who potentially was dealing with any amount of cases, involving both juveniles and adults.  The requirement for constant feedback meant that a significant number of cases fell through the gaps.  I have seen this reported.

They then had responsibility to lift them, but, undoubtedly, some of them were lost, perhaps because of workload.  Some were lost because of a lack of knowledge.  At the same time, 96% were dealt with properly.  Of the 55,000-odd that were returned for investigation, a great proportion of them were dealt with properly.  There are two elements, the first of which relates to systems, training, briefing or whatever it might be.  Second, the officers were asked to do something that was a basic or elementary skill for any member - to prepare a file and submit it for consideration of a prosecution but that did not happen.

I was assured at the time that there were no issues and that everything was being done appropriately and properly.  The case I raised, and I have raised it in the Chamber again recently, relates to a young girl who was the victim of a serious sexual assault.  The perpetrators of that assault had been caught red handed on CCTV and had admitted what they had done.  To the horror of the victim and her family, they were informed that the perpetrators had been issued with a caution and referred to the juvenile diversion programme.  The family were not consulted or asked about this, merely told this is what had happened.  The victim in this case has suffered greatly since then.  She has had great difficulties in her life and has seen the culprits, who admitted the offence, continue with their lives largely uninhibited.  The family feels very distressed and annoyed that this is the case.  <\/p> <p>  In cases of serious sexual assault the youth diversion programme is not an appropriate mechanism and there should be very careful consideration before it might be thought of as appropriate.  According to the Garda website, and elsewhere, before a young person is referred to this programme, he or she must take responsibility for his or her offending behaviour, must agree to be cautioned and, where appropriate, agree to a term of supervision.  The Citizens Information website goes into much more detail on the juvenile diversion programme.  I know that much of this was last updated in 2014, but it refers to the diversional programme having a conference where there would be a meeting with the family of the culprit including the officer involved and that they would discuss the situation and work out an action plan and so on.  However, I hear from many people across the country that in practice, there is a caution and there it ends.  It is wholly appropriate where a young person has been involved in a sufficiently minor offence, and sometimes in more serious offences.  However, there is a serious problem where people put on this programme go on to offend further and there is no assessment of their risk to others.  <\/p> <p>  I want to work this out with the Commissioner.  I understand that when an incident occurs and it is investigated a file is prepared and a potential culprit identified.  Where does that file go?  What is the pathway of the process?

His body was found across the Border in Belleek, County Armagh.  He had been shot in the head.  The local priest who attended the post mortem remarked that it appeared as though a concrete block had been dropped on every part of his body.  His family want justice and they want to know who killed him.<\/p> <p>  In October 2012, the Commissioner gave evidence to the Smithwick Tribunal in closed session.  Following consultation, Judge Peter Smithwick published that evidence.  The Commissioner had told the tribunal that regarding the intelligence files compiled by the PSNI, the RUC and M15 - the British security services - on the murder of Tom Oliver, one file was nothing short of sensational.  File No. 9 stated that intelligence indicated that a senior Provisional IRA council member was directly involved in ordering the murder of Tom Oliver; that that senior Provisional IRA council member had been approached by several Provisional IRA members and others requesting that Tom Oliver not be killed; and that, despite these requests, the senior Provisional IRA council member directed that Tom Oliver be executed.

The position at the moment is all members have been through the training, which is now complete.  It was a very extensive training programme and in the order of 7,000 members have signed the code of ethics.  I can give the precise figure to Chairman.  It keeps creeping on up.  As a consequence, when talking to members in public or private, I do not lose an opportunity to emphasise the importance of the code of ethics.  Together with the Policing Authority, we have a constant focus on it.  We are issuing a short video about the importance of the code of ethics to the organisation, which will be followed by further intervention from myself in terms of asking each individual to sign the code of ethics.  There is also work ongoing with the various representative associations for them to throw their weight behind it as well.  It had an uneasy arrival into the organisation.  We are starting to stabilise it in terms of some of the things that were said about it.  It is not an appendix to our discipline code.  It sets out the standards that we expect of each other and, more important, the standards society expects of us.  It is an essential piece setting out our behaviours in society.  It will be further built upon when we introduce more of a human rights ethos and emphasis on our policing function as well.  The Chairman is correct; this is a direction of travel.  I can also say that unless a garda has signed the code of ethics, he or she does not get promoted; really, his or her career closes down as he or she will not be invited into the specialisms and so on.  It is not just about asking.  There are also some teeth in it.  The important element, when we stand back from it, is that we in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are here to protect the rule of law and in doing so we must set the highest standards for ourselves.  The code of ethics is a document that sets that out.  It is a living document in terms of providing guidance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019021300002#T01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>The last point I wanted to raise is that when the Commissioner last attended here, he undertook to meet with representatives of Justice for the Forgotten.
