Since that time there has been considerable focus within the Department of Health and the HSE on the management and oversight of related operational challenges and strategic priorities and on the implementation of key Government decisions relating to CervicalCheck.<br\/><br\/>Resulting from the Government's desire to assist women and families affected by a lack of disclosure, the Government decided in May to provide a comprehensive package of health and social care supports for the cohort of 221 women and families for whom the audit carried out by CervicalCheck found discordance with the original reading of their slide or slides.  The HSE has an established and stable process in place to ensure that these supports are being provided through designated liaison officers.  In making its decision, the Government also decided that this comprehensive package of supports would be provided to any other woman for whom the independent clinical expert review being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists identified discordance with her original smear test reading.  In its invitation, the committee has referenced women not included in the 221, and I trust this clarifies the position in that regard.  The HSE has recently completed a validation report on the status of the 221 group which has been shared with women and families within the group.  It is intended that this report will assist in ensuring appropriate supports are provided to these women and families.<br\/><br\/>Also in May, the Government decided to establish a scoping inquiry led by Dr. Gabriel Scally.  Dr. Scally's report sets out the impact of non-disclosure on the women and families affected by it as well as providing useful clarity on the limitations of screening and audit.  He set out 50 recommendations aimed at addressing the shortcomings which he identified across a range of areas in screening.<br\/><br\/>In December, following Government approval, an implementation plan for all of the recommendations of the scoping inquiry was published on the website of the Department of Health.  Some of the key elements include continuation of the current dedicated team within CervicalCheck to ensure access to medical records and slides; the inclusion of patient advocates on the HSE board; establishment of a national screening committee; actions to address recommendations on laboratory services and on procurement; the need for mandatory disclosure, which is addressed within the forthcoming patient safety Bill; establishment of an independent patient safety council, which will as its first action undertake a review of open disclosure policies; a number of actions to be led by the National Cancer Registry addressing data sharing, data definitions and collection of patient level details between it and the NSS, as well as governance; and establishment of an expert group within the HSE to review clinical audit processes across all cancer screening programmes, in which process patient advocates will be included.<br\/><br\/>I have referred to the independent clinical expert review which is being led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists following a Government decision on 8 May 2018.  Expertise for this review is also being sourced through the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.  The review includes women who were part of the CervicalCheck audit and women who were not.  Specifically, the scope of the review includes cases of invasive cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established, or approximately 3,000 cases, up to May 2018.  These 3,000 cases includes the 1,482 cases which were notified to CervicalCheck since 2008.  These women's screening histories were audited by CervicalCheck once it had been notified of their cancer diagnosis, and through that process the 221 were identified for whom there was discordance with their original results.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the cases notified to CervicalCheck, a further approximately 1,600 cases were not notified to, and therefore not audited by, CervicalCheck.  Some of these women had been screened prior to diagnosis.The independent clinical expert review encompasses those women within the overall group of approximately 3,000 who were screened by the programme prior to diagnosis, or approximately 1,700 women who are currently contactable and comprehended by the review following a detailed validation process.<br\/><br\/>Where the expert panel's opinion of cytology results differs from the original results provided by CervicalCheck, the panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage and will prepare individual reports for those affected, setting out the facts and the panel's expert and independent assessment of those facts.  The review will also produce an aggregated report which will be provided to the Minister and which is to include recommendations, where appropriate, with the aim of improving care for women.<br\/><br\/>A consent process has been undertaken over recent months, following an extensive process of validation of data.  The HSE has advised that more than 1,070 women have consented to take part in the review.  This is approximately 63%, which is a welcome level of uptake and will facilitate the production of a robust aggregated report.  The expert review panel has been provided with colposcopy and other data from CervicalCheck in respect of women who have consented to participate, and the transfer of slides to the review laboratory has begun.  The royal college has indicated a timeframe of at least six months to complete the review.<br\/><br\/>The Government agreed on 18 December to establish an independent statutory tribunal, chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine.  Primary legislation will be required to establish the tribunal.  Mr. Justice Meenan provided the Government with detailed recommendations on the establishment of the tribunal and the Department has been working intensively on the drafting of a general scheme.  The required legislation is legally novel in providing for the determination of liability outside a traditional court setting.  It is expected that the general scheme will be submitted to Government shortly for approval to draft the Bill.  This Bill is a Government priority and is therefore included in the spring legislative programme.  The Department is also working on the operational elements on the tribunal's establishment, including securing premises.<br\/><br\/>Separately, the Minister also confirmed in December that, in advance of the establishment of the tribunal, he would examine the early establishment of a non-statutory scheme to provide <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments to the women who were affected by the non-disclosure of results of the retrospective audit.  The development of this draft scheme is in progress in the Department in advance of going to Government.  The Department is aware that these are issues to which the utmost priority attaches, and it is working speedily to ensure their completion.<br\/><br\/>In his final report, Dr. Scally emphasised that continuation of cervical screening was of crucial importance.  His report affirmed that the lifetime risk of a woman in Ireland getting cervical cancer was 1 in 135 in 2015, compared with 1 in 96 in 2007, representing a substantial improvement since the programme commenced.  The HSE undertook detailed negotiations in the latter half of 2018 to extend the contracts of existing laboratory service providers to ensure continuation of screening.  Dr. Scally also stated in his report that improved screening uptake, the new HPV testing regime, and the extension of the HPV vaccine to boys together create a realistic prospect of the virtual elimination of cervical cancer in Ireland in the coming decades.  These are a key focus for the Department and the HSE in 2019.  In parallel, and interlinked with these priorities, the management of current capacity issues remains a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Damien McCallion, national director of screening services; Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the women's and infants' programme; and Dr. Lorraine Doherty, clinical director from CervicalCheck.<\/p> <p>  Our focus continues to be on supporting women and their families who were impacted by the CervicalCheck crisis.  We have continued to provide a wide range of supports in line with those agreed with the Department of Health.  These have included the provision of 602 medical cards and the upgrading of eligibility for another 91 medical card holders, provision of access to a broad range of HSE and HSE-funded supports, and the reimbursement of &euro;1.2 million in expenses and costs to those affected.  In addition, we recently completed a detailed piece of work that updated the information on the group of 221 patients.  This was done in conjunction with the 221+ patient representative group and will help inform the provision of future supports for the group of 221 patients.  We also continue to support women and their families in the provision of access to their records and ensuring women get their slides from laboratories where required for legal review.  A new client services unit was established in our national screening service to support this process.  A total of 109 out of 118 slide requests have been dealt with in 25 days on average, and there are only nine requests still being processed.<\/p> <p>  We continue to support the independent international expert panel review being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, which was established by the Minister for women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HSE supported the consent process which has seen 1,072 women or their next of kin consent to participation out of an eligible group of 1,702.  This included establishing a national help desk, developing an eligible data set with the National Cancer Registry, and implementation of a client management system to support the RCOG.  In recent weeks, the laboratories have commenced the transfer of slides.  All slides have been transferred by the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.<\/p><p>Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare have also commenced the transfer process with the imaging of slides for transfer, and a transfer schedule is being agreed this week with those laboratories.<\/p><p> We remain concerned at the length of time being taken to report cervical smears, which is on average at 93 days although it can take up to 27 weeks for the report to be provided.  There is currently a backlog of approximately 78,000 slides.  In 2018, around 370,000 women presented to the programme, which was an increase from 280,000 in 2017.  This increase of approximately 90,000 was a result of the uptake of the out of cycle smear test and more women presenting to the programme, which would in normal circumstances be a positive step.  We have worked with existing private providers, other private providers and public service providers in other countries to try to grow our laboratory capacity.  Some of our existing providers have managed to reduce the wait times and we continue to work with others to try to find additional capacity.  While we continue to pursue active leads, this has proved very challenging due to the global shortage in cytology.  This has been caused as a result of the reduced cytology requirement as countries implement HPV primary screening which leads to a reduction of 80% for cytology requirements.  We are actively trying to identify possible solutions that will help reduce the wait times which we know are causing a lot of anxiety for women.<\/p><p> As part of the laboratories' quality assurance process, we were also made aware of an issue with regard to HPV tests expiration at Quest Diagnostics.  While the clinical risk was deemed very low, we have contacted all those affected and a number of women are being retested.  These tests will be expedited by Quest Diagnostics to ensure a timely response for those women requiring a retest.  A key risk to enabling cervical screening to continue in Ireland was the extension of the laboratory contracts.<\/p><p> The HSE has a signed agreement with one of the private providers and is working through the detail on a contract with the second provider with whom we have a heads of agreement.  We also made a strategic decision to develop a national cervical screening laboratory in conjunction with the Coombe Woman and Infants University Hospital.  This included an initial capital allocation of &euro;5 million to progress the development of the laboratory.  A project team and steering group has been put in place to oversee all aspects of this project.  While this will take some time to develop, it will provide a better balance between public and private provision of laboratory services to the cervical screening programme.<\/p><p> The HSE is progressing plans to introduce HPV primary screening.  A project team is in place and is progressing the various work streams.  We have completed a review of international HPV primary screening implementation, and ICT testing is under way.  The development of education and training materials has commenced, and our procurement team has started the tender process for laboratory services, with a pre-tender market engagement session held before Christmas.  We remain committed to implementing HPV primary screening as soon as possible.<\/p><p> The HSE has contributed significantly to the development of an implementation plan in collaboration with other State agencies in response to the Scally review recommendations.  We have appointed a senior manager to oversee the implementation and established a HSE implementation oversight group, jointly chaired by our chief clinical officer and deputy director general for operations.  We have developed a set of 94 actions arising from recommendations that are the responsibility of the HSE to implement.  Examples of progress to date include key appointments and governance changes.  An organisational review of risk management structures has also been commissioned by the HSE in addition to the establishment of an expert group within the national screening service to review clinical audit processes across all screening programmes.  An interim revision of the HSE's open disclosure policy has commenced and will be communicated and implemented throughout the system pending a more detailed review during 2019.  The HSE has also reviewed and updated its financial records management policy.  All six recommendations from Dr. Scally's interim report have been fully implemented.  The HSE has maintained open communication with patient representatives on the implementation plan and will continue to work collaboratively with them throughout 2019.<\/p><p> The HSE has continued to strengthen the governance and management of screening services.  We have established an interim management team with the reassignment of senior people to key positions while we fill key positions on a permanent basis.  We have recently appointed a director of public health, a CervicalCheck clinical director and a CervicalCheck laboratory quality assurance lead.  In addition, a risk committee for our screening services, which is independently chaired, has been put in place since quarter 3 of 2018.  An interim quality and risk manager was also appointed in quarter 3, and the implementation of Dr Scally's recommendations on strengthening our quality assurance processes has commenced.  I assure members of the committee that the HSE is focused on stabilising the cervical screening programme to enable us to progress the introduction of a new enhanced HPV primary screening testing methodology.  All possible resources are being directed at this challenge.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I have one or two questions and then we will go to the members in order.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  My first question is on the offer of 28 April by the Minister of free repeat smear tests.  We understand the climate at the time but I am more interested in the advice received by the Minister as to how wise the offer was.  As the experts in the area, will the witnesses say who was advising the Minister before the offer was made?  What discussions and consultations were held, specifically on the availability of resources?  Clearly, we now have a backlog which can be traced in part to that announcement.  What advice was the Minister given?  From whom did he seek that advice?  What information did he get and what resource provision was made in advance of the making of the announcement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#F00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The source of the advice was officials in the Department of Health, including the chief medical officer.  As the Vice Chairman said, the context was very much the anxiety among interested parties and on the part of concerned women who were ringing the helpline seeking clarity.  There was a great deal of anxiety.  There was undoubtedly a situation in which women who could afford to do so were going to present at their GPs while women who could not afford to do so might not.  The Minister had, therefore, to make a rapid decision.  Negotiations on a fee took place with the IMO and the option to consult their GPs was provided to women.  If, following a consultation, a woman and her family doctor decided to have a retest, that was paid for.  That was the context.  Officials were involved in the decision and provided the Minister with the advice I have outlined.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of resources, it is fair to say that in all of our discussions with the HSE during 2018 on foot of the CervicalCheck controversy, we were quick to put any resources in place that were required.  Financial provision around the measures that had to be put in place to respond to the controversy was rapidly deployed and the HSE was in constant contact with us on costs, all of which were met over the course of 2018.  The issue arising in this situation is not one of financial resources but of the ability to leverage additional capacity.  The HSE can speak to the substantial amount of work it has done to increase the capacity of the screening programme.  It continues to work in that regard, but there are constraints.<\/p> <p>  It was difficult to quantify when making the decision what the exact uptake of retests would be.  We now know the level of uptake.  The interest and anxiety around CervicalCheck continued for a protracted period which undoubtedly fed into that.  It is worth noting that the finalisation of the Scally report allowed for clarity around the issue.  However, the report took longer than was originally envisaged.  There was a period while Dr. Scally was looking at the laboratories and doing his work when retests continued.  As the Minister said in the House last week, he took further advice once the Scally report was completed.  That advice led him to write to the HSE to say it was an appropriate time to bring retesting to an end.  The HSE advised that while it would do so, the end of December should be the cut-off point as tests were scheduled into that month for women.  That has now taken place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>According to media reports at the weekend, senior people in the HSE advised against this.

Were any provisions made in advance to deal with that increase?

People, including Members of the House, were calling for him to do that, phone calls to the helpline were calling for him to do that, and officials worked with him to try to make the best decision possible in that situation.  That decision was made in hours and days, and not in weeks.

That was not the problem we were faced with.

Our environment is somewhat challenging in securing a partner to work with us.

We do not want to go the market, issue a tender and discover at the end that we do not have a partner which would then set the process back even further.

As for an end date, there is quite a variation, depending on what the private partner can supply.  If it is an existing partner, it will be able to switch on more quickly, but if it is a new one, it could take longer.  Our aim, therefore, is to have all of the other steps completed as quickly as possible in order that we can minimise the critical path in getting to the end point with an absolute end date.  As Ms O'Connor said, our objective is to get there as quickly as possible.  Until we get into that competitive dialogue, we will not really know what the lead time is when it comes to getting the partner over the line.  It could be three, six or nine months.  One important point in tandem with this is that we have made a decision to rebalance public-private provision in the programme.  We are developing a national cervical screening laboratory at the Coombe hospital.  It will still only involve a limited increase.

Regarding the backlog, while there is some variation between laboratories in terms of what is there, we have prioritised colposcopy, which is the highest risk group, across the laboratories, and clear instructions and guidance were given on that.  In addition, where one of the laboratories had pressure, we authorised what is called co-testing, where we ran the HPV test first, which allowed us to triage and ensure we were taking out the smears that have the highest risk.  They are mitigation steps we have taken to try to reduce that risk.<\/p> <p>  The other group is women who are on short recalls.  Deputy Kelly asked this question previously.  We are working through trying to find the technology solution that might help to accelerate those.  We do not have that at the moment but we believe we will be able to do something around that.  We have tried to mitigate the at-risk groups as best we can within the context of how the programme functions to minimise that risk Deputy Donnelly has described in terms of what is there.

However, having said that, of course, women in that group, in the 80,000, will have abnormal smears.  As I have said here previously, the natural history of cervical cancer is that there is a lead-in time of ten to 15 years.  Most of those women who have abnormal smears will be a long way from developing cervical cancer but there will inevitably be some women who are nearer the stage of transitioning from pre-invasive to invasive.

Mr. McCallion told me that, essentially, there was no way to reprioritise or to distinguish totally in this respect.  The delay is now 27 weeks.  It was 24 weeks, and we were told by the Minister it had gone down to 22 weeks, but now it back up to 27 weeks.  Dr. McKenna might explain why that is the case?<\/p> <p>  With short recalls versus routine smears versus those who are going for reassurance tests, the issue of the prioritisation of women is a concern.  Let us be responsible about this.  I agree with Dr. McKenna that when it is broken down, there is a low risk but there is a risk and it is accentuated for a small number of women because of the 27-week delay given they are further along the path and the transition from non-invasive to invasive.  It is at the critical juncture.  If one is caught in that 27-week delay because one is at that point of going from one stage to the other, that is a problem.  There is no point in saying otherwise; it is an issue.  It is a consequence of decision-making and all of that.  I am not apportioning blame; that is not what I am getting at, but there is a concern in terms of how rapidly the delay is tackled because it creates risk.  I have been told of cases of women who are probably at the point where they are moving from one stage to the other and this delay has now pushed on their diagnosis after having had a smear test.  There is a concern about the impact of this disease on their health and the risk.  The consequence for their health is worse because of this.  I accept it is low risk.

Having said that, we will offer more opportunities in terms of the Coombe - the public system.  What most countries have done is try to train people in order that they can operate both HPV and cytology and they obtain both skill sets.  That has been the model.  From our experience of looking at HPV implementation in other countries, that is one of the lessons.  We will try to build that into our workforce plan in the context of screening.  While, as I say, it is small in terms of numbers, we will do whatever it takes to ensure we provide career paths and skills for people and that they can operate within that.

In some ways, unfortunately, it is simple.  First, the demand is continuing to be slightly higher, although it has abated somewhat from the peak at which it would have been.  Second, the capacity is constrained.  Without going back over the earlier pieces, we are trying to source all possible capacity with existing providers - those who are currently working with the programme where it is much easier to, for want of a better phrase, connect them in.  We are also looking outside.  We have done a trawl of the market.  We have also talked to other jurisdictions - Northern Ireland and Scotland - and we are in contact with some of the trusts in England which would operate this service to see what capacity is available.  Unfortunately, it is not merely a simple plug-in for a new provider.  There is quite a lot of work involved and there is a lead-in time to do that.  We continue to have meetings - we have one this afternoon with a possible lead.  We have looked in Europe, in France and Holland, where we have some possibilities.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to get these over the line in increasing the capacity that is available to the programme which ultimately will help.  The steps I outlined earlier are to try to mitigate that.  The prioritisation of colposcopy where the laboratories would have excessive backlog, by running HPV first, effectively triages those who might have the greatest risk.  We are trying to minimise the impact where possible.<\/p> <p>  I will not say it is easy.  It is very challenging.  Globally, we have this issue.

The Minister's officials did not advise against this course of action.  Rather, we worked on it with him.  I acknowledge that the Deputy is reporting what has been stated by others, but, as I set out at the start of the meeting, the advice from officials was that women would present to their GPs because of the degree of anxiety that had been caused.  Women were ringing the helpline to say that and to ask for the State to pay for out-of-cycle testing.  We were faced with a situation whereby some women would be able to afford to pay for private testing but others would not.  The decision was made in a rapidly developing situation.  We agreed with the IMO that a fee would be paid to GPs for the sampling.  In quite a high proportion of cases, women met their GPs, had a conversation and arrived at the conclusion that they did not need another test.  The programme put in place was of great benefit in terms of reassuring people.  Some women, in consultation with their GPs, decided to have another test.  In fairness, at that point many people in addition to civil servants and the Minister, such as commentators and people directly affected by the controversy, believed it was the right thing to do.  In trying to respond to the anxiety which existed, it would have been just as big a mistake to be totally dispassionate and hard headed and decide there was no need for the measures.  It was decided that the programme would be reviewed after three months.

Has a new director of public health been appointed?  What is the status of the independent patient safety council, if the witnesses have that information?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to repeat questions that were already asked and I have been keeping an eye on what has been going on.  In terms of the eradication of cervical cancer, and we have spoken here before about the Australians being on track to eradicate cervical cancer within ten years from when they started, how we are we doing with our target?  I know it was discussed here and that the witnesses could not give a date for HPV testing technically superseding, although not getting rid of, cervical screening.  While the witnesses cannot give a date, I am very conscious that on 10 October, Dr. Denton, the lady from Scotland who was here with Dr. Scally, said that from the inception of the idea of bringing in HPV testing, theoretically, the system could be up and running within a year.  Are we on target?  Can the witnesses give some information on that?<\/p> <p>  We have a backlog of screening, an issue that was dealt with this morning.  In terms of knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer, reference was made to the Jade Goody effect ten years ago, when she tragically died at a very young age from cervical cancer and there was a massive uptake of the cervical programme in the UK and Ireland.  In light of all that has happened, is it true that more women in the cohort are engaging and are more aware?  We heard from the victims but also the medical evidence that there were gaps in people's information and perhaps there was an over-reliance on smears without consideration of symptoms such as bleeding and discomfort.  Perhaps one of the witnesses could speak to that point.<\/p> <p>  To go back to HPV testing, there will be a transition period from the current CervicalCheck programme to the more robust, more accurate, but not perfect HPV screening, and Dr. McKenna mentioned it would require 15% cytology.  In terms of our lab capacity, I am very conscious of Quest Diagnostics.  While I did not bring Dr. Scally's report with me this morning, there was an issue with the ISO accreditation in those labs and how Quest in particular had accredited itself to an American standard over the ISO standard.  When it comes to the transition to HPV testing, my question is whether we can, as a committee, be sure the contracts will be correct and that in regard to those who get the contracts, whether in Ireland or elsewhere, there will be no discrepancy between the standards in the contract and the standards in the labs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#P00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I will deal with the patient safety council.

People with private health insurance were presenting in private clinics in the early days of this scandal offering to pay for a smear test to be done.  Regardless of whether it was right or wrong, the logic of it was it was their free choice to do that.  I know many women who paid.  I supported the idea of that reassurance smear being offered.  At the time, a class gap was forming.  In an information vacuum and when we were all, and still are, up to our necks in this and it was very stressful for all of the witnesses, members of the committee and the public, a two-tier system had emerged where some women who could afford it were presenting in private clinics, while other women with the medical card or who did not have the means were feeling somehow disenfranchised.  Hindsight is wonderful and we would all love to have it.  Looking at this through the lens of all the information we have now is fine but as somebody who was engaging with groups of women and GPs, I can tell the committee that a massive discrepancy was arising between the types of people who were or were not getting a free smear test.  Although in hindsight, it may have contributed to the backlog, if we had not done it at the time, it would have been a far more stressful situation for women and would have increased the amount of fear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#Q00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>We can see part of the reassurance and taking some of the stress out in the difference between the number of women who had a consultation with their GP and the number who went on to have the re-test.

I have read over the record from the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine and the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association, which resisted it fiercely at the time.  They contended that had a programme of intensive training of new clinicians been introduced, we could have kept the service at home.  We did not do so and the rest is history.

I understand that if the test is clear, a clear test result will be sent back to the GP and the woman will meet her GP, or maybe the results are sent directly to the woman.  If it the test is not clear, colposcopy is then involved, which means the woman will see a consultant gynaecologist, a specialist in colposcopy, who will do an examination and take a biopsy.  That biopsy will then go to a histopathologist who is a consultant doctor and a multidisciplinary team will take it on from there.

Where are we now with percentages of HPV vaccine uptake after all of the catch-up programmes?  Are we still going up the graph as opposed to down the graph for uptake of the vaccine among young girls? Although I am very supportive of boys also getting the vaccine in September, it is very important to not take the eye off the girls because it will not work out if we do not keep the pressure on with the uptake among girls.  I assume there is a robust team in place for marketing and awareness around the HPV vaccine to parents and for boys so that we do not end up in the type of situation previously that left a door open for people to attack the vaccine as a of waste money.  I spoke at length with Professor Ian Frazer, a co-creator of the vaccine in Australia, about the barriers they came up against in terms of prejudice and scaremongering and about the savings to be made by using the 9-valent HPV vaccine, where two strains also deal with genital warts.  The positives of using this vaccine is that younger boys tend to respond very well to knowing that a particular vaccine can stop a visible sexually transmitted infection, STI.  Are we ready to go with the process of bringing in the boys' vaccine and are we definitely doing it right?

I think that Dr. David Gibbons resigned over this because he felt so strongly about this.  As resignations are not that common, we need to take heed of it and maybe not just pass it over.  At the time, he pointed out that there were one third fewer diagnoses than there were in Ireland at the time.  It is a public servant's job to give advice and recommendations but at the end of the day a Minister and Cabinet made that decision.  No matter how all of this unfolds when we go down the road, that was a deadly decision and it feeds back into the matter of accountability and us all being accountable for the decisions that we make.  I want to ask some specific questions which go back to the review and audit for the 1,800 smears.  When will that audit begin and when will it finish?  Why do the witnesses think the Taoiseach promised that they would be completed last May?  Was he misguided in doing that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#X03500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I do not mean to be disrespectful but I am here as a civil servant, to give factual information.

Looking at the inverse care law, the cohort which may, because of their circumstances, be the most likely to have a difficulty may be the least likely to take the free test.  Looking beyond the reassurance and the strategy that was in place, has there been a look back on previous smears and the risk that may have been attached to a particular person's clinical characteristics?  Do they need to be notified about future tests?  Someone who may not have taken up the opportunity of having a free test may in fact be the person who requires it based on their own clinical backgrounds.  I know that is a complex piece of work.  Perhaps Dr. Scally is examining it, or perhaps there is no necessity to do it.<\/p><p> Has a risk profile been developed to determine what is an urgent smear and what is not?

It will be rolled out in September of this year.<\/p> <p>  The decision to carry out retests was made by the Minister based on professional advice, and we have been through that issue over the course of the morning.  The Minister received advice, including the advice of the Chief Medical Officer.  We could speculate on the inverse care law, but there are a couple of things we should consider.  Without the State saying that it would fund a consultation, those with the means to do so would have participated and others without the means would probably have been least likely to participate.  The fact that the State provided funding equalised things to some degree.  It also must be considered that there is quite a fall-off between the number that had consultations with their GPs who then went on to take a test.  It seems that the very fact that they were reassured was sufficient for them at that stage.  Ultimately, if people did not come forward, get a retest or go to their GP, the programme still has those people and will continue to call them for uptake.  They are still within the programme; it is not the case that they have fallen out of it.  They will still be in the programme and called according to the timescale set out therein.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":562,"content":"<p>In terms of the European guidelines, while it would have been an input into the previous quality assurance, QA, standards, one of the actions from Dr. Scally's recommendations is to update the QA standards in line with best practice, which would include the European guidelines, and look at those in other jurisdictions as well.  That is also being done from two perspectives.  The first is the current programme and the second is another process for HPV testing which is now under way and which will require a new QA model.<\/p> <p>  The standard turnaround for tests before the crisis was 17 days, and covered the period from when the slide went to the laboratory to when results were supplied to the GP or the patient.  We are clearly some way from that turnaround level at the moment, and the challenge of addressing it was what we discussed this morning.  We need to find more capacity to address the backlog that is in place.  In terms of risk mitigation, we have prioritised the colposcopy clinics where there is clearly a need to read those smears much earlier.  We are working on solutions which address the point the Deputy made about clinical backgrounds.  A woman in a programme could be on a six month, one year, three year or five year recall, and that, in some way, reflects the risk to the woman.  We are looking at whether a technological solution could be developed in this area.  It is quite complex.  Unfortunately the group for six months to one year recalls has a higher risk profile than the normal three to five year recalls.  In addition, we had concerns about one of our laboratories, which had a quantum of the backlog, and so we sanctioned the use of HPV testing as a way of triaging the situation.  By running them through HPV screenings those smears that were perhaps in a higher risk category were identified and moved to cytology much earlier.  Those are the sorts of actions we have taken to try to mitigate the risk, while still trying to find capacity to get us to a stable point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speech","time":1550048400,"counter":563,"content":"<p>For those on a six month cycle of smear testing, is it possible that some of them could be waiting six months for the outcome of their tests?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019021300002#Z00600","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550048400,"counter":564,"content":"<p>That is a risk at the moment, and we are trying to address it by putting in some sort of solution that would identify those cases in some way.
