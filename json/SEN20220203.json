By coming in here as a senior Minister to take the issue, it is an indication that he is taking it seriously and not attempting to fob it off.  This is a very serious matter.<\/p> <p>I will try to give some figures because there has to be a factual basis.  There is an income crisis in the pig sector in agriculture at the moment.  It is a chronic income crisis.  It is well known but I wish to give it chapter and verse, if you like.  Factory prices, at the moment, are &euro;1.42 per kg deadweight.  The production cost is &euro;1.75 deadweight.  One can see the bind already.  The average loss on a pig is &euro;33.  Feedstuff has increased by &euro;120 per tonne.  There is every prospect that raw materials will not get cheaper.  The average sow unit is 500 sows, and it is currently losing &euro;8,000 per week.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are welfare issues on farms because they are not able to pay for feed.  Factories are struggling to clear the backlog of slaughter from Christmas.  Northern plants have reduced kill from the South because Covid has taken away workers and some have not returned from abroad, which has resulted in staffing issues.  I presume there is also a market issue as the market has contracted.<br\/><br\/>There are between 8,500 to 9,000 people employed in the pig sector nationally.  They are employed in places where jobs cannot be readily replaced.  I note the Minister is nodding and he understands this point as a Donegal man.  People work in places where we cannot ask the IDA to develop a factory in the morning.  This is a very serious matter.  The people have to be sustained.  There are nearly 2,000 workers in Cavan-Monaghan and the next big centre is Cork.  Cavan has a significant concentration of the pig sector, comprising small and large units.  There are huge losses <i>pro rata<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>There are Brexit loans for SMEs, but there is a slowness in the response from the banks.  The Minister had a conference with the banks, but farmers are not getting definite word back.  Some farmers refurbished their sheds with cash flow and are not able to show good cash flow from olden times as a result, which creates an issue with banks.  The Minister might bear that in mind.  Some 10% will not benefit.<br\/><br\/>I am sure the Minister is aware that the French and Polish have been successful in getting approval from Europe for packages of support for their pig farmers.  I have great respect for the Minister, who is very effective.  He is meeting pig farmers today in Naas, which is an important meeting.  I know enough about politics to know the Minister will not announce everything to me here, but I appeal to him to go to the meeting with options and money for those farmers.  They need a support package.<br\/><br\/>There have been emergency supports for everyone over recent years, which was right in the context of Covid.  I now appeal to the Minister to come up to the plate for pig farmers.  This is about the jobs of up to 9,000 people and individual families who run large farms in places where people could not get other jobs.  These people have done a lot in their local communities.  I could go through chapter and verse on that for another ten minutes, but I will finish.  This needs an emergency response and people in the sector need hard cash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#A00700","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Reilly for raising this very important issue, and for having raised it with me since it has emerged and become more acute.  The continued development of the pigmeat sector, as the Senator knows, is a priority for me, given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context, which he clearly outlined in his contribution.  It is one of the largest agrifood sectors and has shown remarkable growth in recent years.  The sector supports approximately 8,000 jobs, as the Senator pointed out, spanning production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacturing and services.  It is an intense, focused and commercially driven sector.<\/p> <p>Our pig farmers have always been remarkably resilient and I am acutely aware of the challenges they face.  The pigmeat sector across the EU has faced significant challenges in 2021, including the impact of African swine fever in a number of member states and, as a consequence, the loss of third country markets.  This has had a knock-on effect on supply and prices within the Single Market.  The average price paid for pigs in Ireland has fallen as a result in recent months, in line with trends across the EU.  The 2021 average price was over 8% lower than that of 2020.  As of 30 January, the average grade E pig price came in at &euro;141 per 100 kg, just under 7% lower than the same week last year.  However, this is still above the EU average price.<\/p> <p>At the recent European Council of agriculture ministers, I clearly expressed my concerns regarding the difficulties facing our Irish pigmeat sector, including the ongoing impact of increases in fuel, fertiliser, feed and energy prices over recent times, which are putting real pressure on margins, and the sustained nature of the difficulties being experienced on the pigmeat market.  I sought a rapid deployment from the European Commission of appropriate solutions on both issues.  I also met members of the IFA national pig committee last week to discuss concerns.<\/p> <p>Following this, the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and I met the banks to discuss the current challenges in the pigmeat sector and the importance of their ongoing financial support.  At this meeting the importance of the sector was emphasised as well as its overall resilience and the importance of the banks' supports for their customers through the current downturn in the business cycle.  The key message was that farmers experiencing cash flow difficulties should engage with banks as soon as possible to discuss options and that the banks remain committed to supporting their customers in the period ahead.  I am also engaging with the feed industry to determine what it can do for farmers and customers.<\/p> <p>Separately, the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and I met the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to discuss the Brexit impact loan scheme and Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, both of which are financed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  These finance schemes can be used for working capital and include features that address the current financial challenges facing pig farmers.<\/p> <p>We are all aware of the cyclical nature of the commodity markets which, for the pig sector at this time, is very much compounded by the rising input cost of feed and energy.  During this period, maximum flexibility of financial matters is needed to ensure the ongoing viability of those in the sector.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, last week chaired the round table on the pigmeat sector and had a further detailed discussion with stakeholders, including farming representatives and the processing and feed industries on the current difficulties.  In terms of State supports, at the round table Bord Bia outlined the significant efforts being made to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets - 50% of our pigmeat goes to the domestic market.  Teagasc also outlined the dedicated advisory supports available.<\/p> <p>I and my Department continue to monitor the market situation closely and are examining possible measures to assist in supporting farmers through what is a very challenging time.  It is a truly unprecedented time for the pig sector and I very much stand with farmers at this time, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and we are working hard to find workable solutions.  We will meet many pig farmers from throughout the country later this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#B00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his positive response.

I rise to seek absolute clarity on the future of Cathal Brugha Barracks and the Irish Defence Forces.  We are all aware of the outrageous tweet from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, which came from left field and shocked all of us.  Not only did it shock all of us in this House, it shocked the defence community throughout the country and none more so than in my native Kildare.<\/p> <p>I come from a very strong Defence Forces area and we are honoured to be home to many phenomenal Defence Forces personnel and their families.  We have the headquarters in Newbridge and a very fine military camp in the Curragh.  They have added an immeasurable amount to our local communities over the years.  I was fortunate to be there yesterday, as was the Acting Chairperson, Senator Wall, with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which is undertaking a tour of military barracks and naval bases, which is good.  We had the opportunity to engage with the General Officer Commanding, GOC, and other personnel on issues such as recruitment and retention.<\/p> <p>While I accept that he represents the constituency in which Cathal Brugha Barracks is situated, for a Minister who has no military or defence portfolio to take to Twitter and essentially announce the closure of the barracks with no forewarning or forward planning was an insult to the personnel that serve and the families that live there, and to the entire Defence Forces.  There is no doubt we have a significant issue with housing which is a priority for the Government.  I absolutely accept that and that is how it should be, but we also need to have Defence Forces that are up to full capacity and capability.  A balance has to be struck.<\/p> <p>I have no doubt there could be negotiation and if the idea was presented to those in Cathal Brugha Barracks of an alternative functioning, state-of-the-art barracks, it possibly would be considered.  However, the notion that we would close down such a significant military structure as the city of Dublin's finest barracks, especially in the year of the centenary of Michael Collins and the treaty, beggars belief.<\/p> <p>A Minister having such disregard for our defence families is unacceptable and I hope we get a response from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that will go some way towards healing the wound and give us clarity and hope for the way forward.  What is the future of Cathal Brugha Barracks?  Will it remain fully operational?  Are there plans for the closure of the barracks?  Are there plans for a new barracks?  Will there be an apology to the defence community throughout the country for the disrespect shown by the haphazard attempt at this announcement?<\/p> <p>I briefly mentioned recruitment and retention.  Over the past two years, the way the defence community has responded to needs throughout the pandemic has been top class.  That has increased the morale among the Defence Forces where morale had been extremely low for a number of years.  The geopolitical area we are in with regard to Russia has again brought the Defence Forces right to the heart and forefront of all we do in this country.<\/p> <p>They deserve our support.  It is a wonderful career, as was pointed out to us yesterday.  However, the fact that men and women are not going forward and are leaving, and that the Defence Forces are very short of trainers to be able to recruit, leads to the suggestion that not enough supports are put in place to make it an attractive career in which to stay or to recruit.  The Minister needs to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#C00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising this matter.  I am mindful of the significant media attention this matter has attracted over the past week and the impact such coverage has had on the personnel and their families who serve in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  In that context, I want to make it very clear that no decision has been taken by the Government on the relocation of Defence Forces operations at Cathal Brugha Barracks.<\/p> <p>Cathal Brugha Barracks is the only operational barracks in the capital.  McKee Barracks is an administrative centre for the Defence Forces and certainly does not have the capacity to house the 1,000 personnel currently serving in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  It is recognised as holding a pivotal location.  The Government's senior military advisers in the Defence Forces have made it very clear that its location is vital for a range of reasons, some of which I cannot go into explicit details on for operational and security reasons.<\/p> <p>That being said, some should be self-evident to all, such as the strategic location regarding key Government buildings and national critical infrastructure, and the ability to respond and assist other civil authorities in the event of terrorist attacks or other security-related emergencies.  In addition, as an operational barracks, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, an ordnance disposals team operates from there, as does the permanent armed response unit which is on immediate notice to deploy if required.  I will not dwell on the historical importance of Cathal Brugha Barracks which Members of the House will be fully aware of.<\/p> <p>Of course, and understandably from a non-military or security perspective, the barracks occupies a significant land bank which could be used for other purposes strategic to the State.  In recognition of the fact that this has become an issue that arises every couple of years, the Department of Defence has secured funding from the Department of the Taoiseach, under the Housing for All fund, to engage consultants to undertake a cost benefit analysis and feasibility study on the possible relocation of Cathal Brugha Barracks.<\/p> <p>This is an exploratory exercise which will allow an informed debate to take place on the implications and practicalities of responding to calls to relocate from the current location.  My Department, together with the Defence Forces, is developing a tender proposal for a feasibility study and will go to the market in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>I will be very clear, because significant doubt has been raised in recent days, that there is no decision to relocate, rather it is intended to fully assess over the course of the coming months the implications, feasibility and practicalities of such a move.  The representative associations and other stakeholders who have been very vocal in recent days, including civilian employees, will be kept appraised of progress as their interest is central to this, as indeed is mine as Minister for Defence.

I believe that when he made the statement on social media, it was on the basis of a case he has been making for many years, namely, that this is a very strategic site that could be used for housing.  I do not believe anything was meant by that.  He also recognised the Defence Forces need to be accommodated.  What I would say as Minister for Defence is that no decision has been made to move out of Cathal Brugha Barracks or to relocate that barracks.  We are not at that stage.  We are going through a tendering process to put a feasibility study in place that will take some time so that we can weigh up all the pros and cons.  We will work with the Defence Forces and representative bodies and seek security advice to make the right decision for Defence Forces personnel, their families and Dublin.  I thank the Senator for her additional comments.<\/p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, I reiterate that no decision to relocate Cathal Brugha Barracks has been made.  I was very clear on this point in the D&aacute;il.  The only decision made to date has been to undertake an independent and externally conducted cost-benefit analysis and feasibility study on the implications of considering such a move.  This study will comprise three fundamental aspects.  One involves the consideration of whole life cycle costs and benefits, including new land acquisition costs and provision of a new barracks, which undoubtedly would be necessary should this move take place.  The second involves assessment of the operational and security implications and risks associated with relocation, because they are very real.  The third involves determination as to the feasibility of relocating incorporating internal comparators as to how other states manage the threats and risks to their capital infrastructure in their capital cities.  This project should take between nine to 12 months to complete and all relevant stakeholders will be briefed as the project progresses.  It is expected the aim of the project will be achieved, namely, to allow for an informed and holistic debate on the merits of the current location at Cathal Brugha Barracks, which has served Ireland well for a long time.<\/p> <p>Regarding the Senator's last question, I hope to be in a position next week to launch the outcome of the work of the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces.  I believe this report is probably the most important piece of work done strategically in terms of the future of the defence debate in Ireland and the Defence Forces, how they are resourced and capability issues we have seen in many decades.  I hope it will be an opportunity for us to debate in some detail in this House, which I suspect the Acting Chairman would appreciate, what the future of the Defence Forces looks like and the resourcing implications of those recommendations.  I look forward as Minister for Defence to leading that debate.  This is a commission set up by the Government.  It is a commission I put together in terms of its chair and members.  It has extraordinary experience contributing to the recommendations it is hoped we will publish at some point next week.  This is in some ways a watershed moment for a future reflection and commitment from Government on the Defence Forces of the future and how we resource, structure and support them in the context of creating a very exciting opportunity for many young people to choose a career in the Defence Forces for the future.<\/p> <p>I hope I have clarified the situation concerning Cathal Brugha Barracks, primarily for Defence Forces personnel and their families but also for the broader public and this House.  I look forward to bringing forward the details, recommendations and work of the commission, which has been working on this issue for more than 12 months.

One man I have spoken about here previously, who is a champion of positive mental health and who has used his national profile to campaign on the issue is Rory O'Connor, a fellow Meath man who runs Rory's Stories on Facebook and has a huge following not just in terms of his humorous take on Irish life but because he uses his profile to speak about mental health with a series of thought-provoking pieces.  He has battled his own demons in the past and chronicled them in a top-selling book.  I spoke to him before coming to this Chamber and he said, \"Shane, a big storm is coming and we need to put up the umbrellas as best we can.\"<\/p> <p>He told me how through his engagement with schoolchildren - he conducts talks in schools throughout Ireland every week - he can see in the faces of 17 and 18-year-olds how they have suffered immensely.  It will take them years to come to terms with the impact on their mental health and development as young men and women from the isolation they experienced during lockdown and to deal with the fallout from that prolonged period of isolation away from normal life.  He also spoke quite extensively about the impact on men in their 60s from his work with men's sheds.  These are people who would not normally be well able to express their emotions and how they are feeling.  He said he can see from that that there is a significant problem in that regard as well from going around and meeting men in these men's sheds.  Those were his words to me: \"Shane, a big storm is coming and we need to put up the umbrellas as best we can.\"<\/p> <p>I am calling for the reinstatement of this role of director of mental health services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Shane Cassells:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know that the Minister of State has done a huge amount of work even in the last week.

It is a hugely importantly issue.  I have consistently sought the reinstatement of a national director for mental health post in the HSE since coming into my post a year and a half ago.  The previous mental health strategy, A Vision for Change, recommended that a national mental health director be established under the leadership of a national director to prioritise the mental health agenda and to drive it centrally within the HSE.  The important line was to drive it centrally.<\/p> <p>This was achieved with the appointment of the first HSE national director in 2013.  The programme for Government commits to examining the reinstatement of the national directorate for mental health.  I am confident that I have the full support of colleagues in this matter.  Given the importance of mental health, we now have an Oireachtas sub-committee on mental health.  The sub-committee is chaired by Senator Black who is here in the Seanad.  Senator Black could stand here and talk about what I am talking about today, which is the importance of being able to drive the vision in relation to mental health.  As part of the HSE structural changes, the post of national director for mental health was disbanded and a new national director of community health service operations subsumed the operational role of the existing national directors for primary care, social care, health and wellbeing, and mental health.  The previous national director post for mental health was split into two separate dedicated leads at assistant national director level, one within community operations and one within community strategy.  An additional three new senior roles were introduced.  These were a chief operations officer, a chief strategy and planning officer, and a chief clinical officer.   <\/p> <p>Standing here today, I am not trying to take anything from these fantastic people who are doing phenomenal work every day of the week and who are driving on the challenges we have in mental health.  However, let us stop and think of the two years we have come through with Covid-19, as well the fact that we do not know what we will see in the next year or two regarding people with long Covid and, especially, older people who are trying to reconnect with society, young people who have been really challenged regarding their junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations, hybrid education, moving onto college, as well as the ordinary cut and thrust of every day life.  It has been challenging for people.  Now, more than ever, I strongly believe that we need a national director for mental health within the HSE to drive our new mental health policy, Sharing the Vision.  It is an excellent policy.  However, policies are fine, but implementation is key.<\/p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to speak about the situation that has occurred in Kerry in the last two weeks.  To update the House, I am taking a three-pronged approach to how we rebuild confidence in CAMHS throughout the country.  First, there will be an independent audit on compliance, structure and process.  We will look at team composition, we will look at the skill mix, we will look at the clinical operation in governance and we will look at access to services, which are important.<\/p> <p>The second part of the three-pronged approach is that we will do a full research piece.   We will speak to service users and to young people about their experience nationally.  This will be done from an academic focus.  However, it is important to speak to young people from all over Ireland about how they got on when they were referred to CAMHS.<\/p> <p>The third part, and an important part, is an audit of the prescribing practice.  This will be a full audit of the 73 CAMHS teams through the country regarding their prescribing practice.  The whole purpose is to design the audit, to collect, to collate and to report.  <\/p> <p>A non-adversarial approach will be adopted in compensation.  Details will be worked out in consultation with my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#E00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Minister of State for that response.

Earlier this week, the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, advised that it had decided not to press charges against officials or agencies who were responsible for the care of the intellectually disabled young woman at the heart of the Grace case.  I am absolutely appalled and confused by this decision.  It is my hope that the Minister of State might be able to provide some much-needed clarification.<\/p> <p>What was allowed to happen to Grace, as well as to the other young people who suffered abuse in the same foster home, is truly shameful.   The fact that the systems which perpetuated and subsequently covered up the abuse have not been held to account to date is completely indefensible.  When the file was brought to the DPP in 2020, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recommended that criminal charges be brought against those who were responsible.  However, the DPP did not follow the recommendations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we do not know why.  To my mind, this does not serve the victims of the abuse, nor does it serve the wider public interest.  I ask the Minister of State today whether his Department will consider making public the DPP&rsquo;s decision in respect of the abuse perpetrated in the Grace case.  Additionally, it would be helpful to get some clarity as to which legislation the charges were recommended under by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Legislation created in 2012 to combat institutional cover-ups seems to have been ignored, because there does not seem to be any evidence of it being enforced.<\/p> <p>Can the Minister of State, or his Department, provide information and statistics on the enforcement of the Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons Act 2012?  The national independent review panel, NIRP, was set up in 2017, but it is not presently clear whether other instances exist, potentially those that are just as serious as those in the Brandon or Grace cases that are currently being reviewed by the panel.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The national independent review panel, NIRP, was set up in 2017 but it is not presently clear whether other incidents exist that are potentially just as serious as those in the Brandon or Grace cases currently being reviewed by the panel.  It is not possible to access information about the incidents under review, even through freedom of information.  Will incidents reviewed by the NIRP ever see the light of day or do we have to wait until another whistle-blower raises alarm bells?  What processes are in place to actually allow public scrutiny of how those incidents are handled by the panel?  If we consider the incidents within the remit of the Farrelly commission and those investigated by the NIRP in preparing the Brandon report, we can see a pattern being established of tragic incidents occurring under the watch of the State with little accountability.  It is clear that front-line staff are reporting incidents of abuse but appropriate action does not always follow.  Clearly the issue instead lies with senior staff management and officials who failed to act on reports of abuse and in some cases even work to cover up the abuse which is being reported.  It is essential that future legislation creates accountability for these managers and officials, potentially even through criminal sanctions.  Is legislative reform planned in this respect?<\/p><p>I am conscious of time but I think we also need to consider what legislation is required to prevent both the abuse of individuals in State care and the abuse of power within State institutions that have been exposed in the likes of the Grace case and the Brandon report.  Will the Minister of State provide clarity on how he will seek reform on this issue and how he will create accountability?<\/p><p>I know the Minister of State cares deeply about this issue.  I know he and the Department officials are working hard to ensure that individuals who suffered abuse while in the care of the State receive the support they require and that future abuse under the purview of State agencies or bodies is prevented.  My concern, however, is that we do not hold the systems themselves to account.  Then it is only a matter of time before the next failure, the next incident and the next tragedy.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#E00600","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter today.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.<\/p> <p>The House will be fully aware of the historical abuse allegations which have been raised about a foster care home in the south east and in particular as they relate to a young woman known as Grace.  It is absolutely incumbent on the State to ensure the safety and protection of all vulnerable people in its care.  We owe it to Grace and all vulnerable people in the State to ensure that cases of this nature do not happen again.  It is important to note that Grace is now in receipt of both residential and multidisciplinary supports based on assessed needs.  This support is provided via a section 39 provider organisation but with the support of HSE services in CHO 5.<\/p> <p>The Senator has raised the issue of what is being done to address the systemic failures identified in this case.  I want to acknowledge a number of structures and governance mechanisms that the HSE now has in place to ensure safeguarding of vulnerable people in receipt of disability support services.  Nationally, the HSE has implemented a number of measures to protect vulnerable people including a revised national safeguarding policy.  At local level, safeguarding teams have been introduced in each CHO to protect and support the welfare of service users.  The HSE board has established functions which provide oversight structures through which the executive is held to account in respect of quality and patient safety matters.  A subcommittee, the quality and patient safety committee, provides oversight with regard to safeguarding policy.<\/p> <p>The national safeguarding office has been established by the HSE.  It supports the operation of Safeguarding Ireland and provides support and guidance to the CHO safeguarding teams.  The HSE has also revised its national safety incident management policy.  The HSE national disability operations team is implementing a national quality improvement plan to support compliance with HIQA regulatory standards through a resourced team led by a national disability specialist.<\/p> <p>The HSE has established a post of confidential recipient, an independent postholder who reports directly to the CEO of the HSE.  This important role provides a channel for any concerned individual, and indeed service users themselves, to confidentially report concerns of abuse, negligence, mistreatment or poor care practices at any HSE-funded day service, residential care service or home support.  This post provides a vital voice for vulnerable older people and people with a disability.<\/p> <p>The Dignam report recommended that the HSE and the Garda put in place a memorandum of understanding to support publication of reports by the HSE where there is a live Garda investigation.  The HSE and the Garda have developed a draft memorandum of understanding, and I understand it is awaiting final sign-off.<\/p> <p>The Garda submitted a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2020 recommending prosecution and last week the DPP directed that no criminal charges will take place.  The House will be aware that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in its decision-making process and no other person or body, such as the Department of Health, can be involved in the process of deciding whether to prosecute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#F00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I wish them well with that campaign.<\/p> <p>There is something that I want to raise and I have struggled with talking about it over the past few hours.  We all know the grief and the sorrow that the whole country felt around the horrific murder of Ashling Murphy.  We have all vowed and committed to do better and I have no doubt that we will.  Hearing of the random attacks that have happened since then, in Cork, in Kilkenny and yesterday in St. Stephen's Green, brought me back to last summer when my 12-year-old niece was walking through St. Stephen's Green on a sunny day and was attacked by older men and beaten down to the ground.  Luckily, she was not hurt physically, apart from bruises and that, but there is the emotional and psychological impact of that.  It really worries me about our society.  There is only so much that we can do at a legislative level in terms of criminal justice and policing.  We need to make our streets safer with CCTV, lighting, etc.  As was said in Hamlet \"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\".  We need to get to that misogyny and that feeling that a tiny minority have that they can control women and that they can show that anger.  It is awful.  It merits not going away from the issue; we need to talk about it again.<\/p> <p>The other issue that I want to raise relates to the primary medical certificate.  A commitment was given in the D&aacute;il recently by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, that a comprehensive review of the scheme would be undertaken to include a broader review of mobility supports for people with disabilities.  Deputy Donohoe is working with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, on this.  This important work has to be expedited.  We know so many people whose choice in the way they live their lives, because of the impact of their disability, has been taken away.  We all hear of these cases.

It is something that I am conflicted on as a criminal barrister and somebody who has practised in an area of law that requires principles of justice to be applied delicately.  I believe wholeheartedly in the importance of a fair trial, the right to represent yourself and all of the other rights that are contingent on that.  There is an issue that has been about for a number of years and which has perhaps come to the fore this week - I do not want to talk about any particular case - and that is the right of persons to represent themselves in criminal trials and to face their accuser.  It is tremendously important to allow people to face their accusers.  It is part of our system.  It is one of the fair trial principles that we have.  You must know the details of who is accusing you, what they are saying and all the rest, in order to be able to mount a defence.  There also must be a coterie of cases where we can legitimately restrict the right of a particular person to face a particular accuser.  It is probably reasonable in certain types of cases.  The ones, of course, that spring to mind are cases such as rape and sexual assault.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In those types of case it must be reasonable to say a person may not directly cross-examine the person who has accused him or her of a very serious and personal offence.  It is, as I say, delicate.  It requires very careful consideration.<\/p><p>Very often we put down these principles and they become expanded after they become law.  An example of that is section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act, which allows statements to be put to people.  It was originally envisaged as being part of a very narrow set of offences and it has expanded over time through practice.  Thus, it is something that requires very careful consideration.  However, it is also right to say that where a person makes a complaint of that type of offence it is reasonable to say to the accused person that of course he or she can represent themselves and conduct the trial, however unwise that might be, but he or she is not entitled to directly cross-examine that person.  He or she can only do so through counsel.  He or she can only do so through a lawyer.  It is important we consider a legislative solution to that.  We have a coterie of people at the Bar of Ireland, and I am one of them, who are incredibly professional, qualified and experienced in this area and know what the parameters of that process are.  An individual who represents himself or herself does not.  That should not stop them from doing it, however unwise that might be, as I said, but it should allow us to step in and say there is a small and very carefully-defined category of offences where it is not acceptable to do that and where the law is going to prohibit someone from doing that.  It is reasonable for us to explore in a debate and in a legislative solution what we can do to protect complainants who come forward in certain types of cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#K00500","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Pauline O'Reilly to the Leader's chair.  I had intended raising another issue but in light of Senator O'Loughlin's Commencement matter I want to focus a little bit more on that issue as it is critically important.  It goes to the very heart of communication in government and how a Government, especially a coalition one, and in this case a tripartite coalition Government, communicates with people and with the citizens.  The matter is of course Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines.  The Senator teased out the issue with the Minister for Defence who spoke at great length about it.  In fairness, he gave it a lot of time.  There are issues of concern here.  Much of the criticism and concern in recent days is over this conflict of messaging involving the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I fully respect and accept this site falls within his constituency and he has every right to comment on such matters, especially in relation to Government policy on it.  We then had the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, before us earlier telling us there had been absolutely no decision.  That clarity is welcome and I thank Senator O'Loughlin for it.  However, what is really interesting is we need to be careful about the messaging and the hysteria building up around these things.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, gave great clarity earlier.  The key message in all of this that he said: \"The Department of Defence has secured funding from An Taoiseach, under the Housing for All implementation fund, to engage consultants to undertake a Cost Benefit Analysis and feasibility study in relation to the possible re-location of Cathal Brugha Barracks.\"  That, in fairness, is in line with what the Minister for Transport said.  How it was said and the timing of the messaging was the issue.  It caused the confusion and sent a mixed message.  The Acting Leader cannot answer for either of them to highlight the issue.  What, therefore, am I asking for?  The Minister for Defence earlier confirmed there would be a report, which he hopes to able to publish, by the commission on the future of the Defence Forces.  I welcome that and know many people in the Chamber have contributed to that ongoing debate.<\/p> <p>We must always remember the three Rs in the context of our Defence Forces.  We must respect them.  We must support their restructuring and their resourcing.  They are three key messages for the Defence Forces.  I acknowledge the enormous work and focus my group colleague, Senator Craughwell, has put into this area.  He is very focused on this and has given it an enormous amount of his time, both in the House and outside it.  Therefore, my final ask is that when this commission report is published next week - and the Minister confirmed to the House this morning that is what he intends - we have an early debate on it.  I am aware others have asked for that; I am not asking for anything new.  I would like us to ask the Leader's office to facilitate us, where practical, to have a debate on this important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#L00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I place on record my appreciation to the Leader for allocating cross-party time next Thursday for the Safe Access to Termination of Pregnancy Services Bill 2021.  It is another example of how this House can work constructively and positively on important issues.  I know it is a Thursday afternoon but I appeal to Members, again on a cross-party basis, to ensure we have an important Committee Stage on that Bill.  There are going to be amendments proposed by us in response to the Minister's concerns because we want to make this Bill as effective as possible.  We would, therefore, appreciate the support of Senators.<\/p> <p>There is an added urgency to this matter.  There have been ongoing protests outside University Maternity Hospital Limerick for some time.  However, Together for Safety has informed me in the past couple of weeks that the protests are now coinciding with the exact times of the appointments that women, including some who are pregnant, have for their own private medical business and often for business that relates to terminations.  That is disturbing and clearly it shows that information from within the hospital is being shared with these protesters.  I cannot say that is happening in every hospital but the protests are happening all across the county in State-owned hospitals.  I am firmly of the view, as is my party, that the protesters have no business there.  This is the business of the woman attending a hospital and her business alone.  Granted, the right to protest is important but protesting directly outside a maternity hospital is just appalling.  It is within all our powers now to do something about it.<\/p> <p>When the Minster for Health was in the Chamber on Second Stage he asked whether we would co-operate on his Bill and I put on record that we would because we all want to see this done.  There is no Bill at this point in time apart from the Together for Safety Bill.  I hope the Acting Leader will acknowledge we have approached this on a cross-party basis.  I am not claiming to own the Bill.  I acknowledge that the Acting Leader, the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group today and Members on a cross-party basis joined us behind the Together for Safety banner months ago.  I appeal to them to keep that co-operation going next week because we must make progress.  There is an added urgency to this when women are being targeted at the time of their appointments.  I find that to be the most appalling behaviour but that is what is happening in Limerick, the city where I live.  I ask that we co-operate in the best spirit of this Chamber next week.  We have Committee Stage of the Bill.  Let us deal with the Bill professionally but let us support it and get it through to the next Stage so that we can make an advance in protecting the right of people to attend hospitals without interference, intimidation and without subtle coercion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#L00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Pauline O'Reilly as Acting Leader.  I wish to take a moment to mark the tragic death of Eoin Collins after a short illness.  He passed away on 1 February in the care of his family in Lucan, just three months after the untimely and sudden death of his husband, Josep Adalla, in November.<\/p> <p>Eoin was one of the principal architects of the extraordinary progress and change for LGBTQI people over the past few decades.  As one of the founders of the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, he was a key driver of legislative reform and progress towards equality for LGBTQI people.  His fingerprints are on much of the groundbreaking change we have seen over the past 20 years.  Eoin and his colleagues campaigned for many years for decriminalisation and having achieved that in 1993, they then campaigned for wide-ranging multi-ground equality legislation in close collaboration with a range of other equality organisations.  He then worked with the Rainbow Coalition and Labour Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, to bring forward the Employment Equality and Equal Status Bills that were crucial in building a fairer, more equal Ireland for LGBTQIA people and for all those included under the nine grounds of that legislation.  Throughout this period and prior to working on the staff or GLEN, Eoin worked with Nexus Research Ireland for more than two decades and was a key figure in community development across Ireland.<\/p> <p>As a facilitator, writer and activist, his capacity for vision and empathy for change placed him at the heart of many human rights struggles.  His work was always tempered by critical self-scrutiny and genuine humility.  His work allowed him opportunities and spaces to make lasting changes in dealing with issues of discrimination, exclusion and marginalisation.  With the support of The Atlantic Philanthropies, Eoin then worked on GLEN's staff to build on the foundation of legislative progress to drive real, meaningful change in the lives of LGBTQIA people.  He worked with Governments, politicians, including many in this House, civil and public servants and civil society bodies to ensure LGBTQIA people could be free and equal.  This work included transformative change in education, physical, mental and sexual health, workplace and immigration reform, the first research in Ireland on trans equality and, in particular, the equal recognition and protection of LGBTQIA relationships and families.  Eoin was a member of the Government's Colley group, which charted a way to marriage and constitutional equality for same-sex couples and was instrumental in the group's findings that only marriage equality would deliver that equality.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He is one of the principle drivers of the work to secure comprehensive civil partnership legislation - which is possible without a referendum - and the foundations of family recognition legislation, both of which paved the way for the eventual success of that extraordinary referendum in 2015.  <\/p><p>He leaves an incredible legacy of hard won progress for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual, LGBTQIA, people.

Mr. Mark Zuckerberg outlined how the metaverse technology will involve inhabiting virtual spaces, using wearable sensors to track one's body and wearable headsets and other sensors, which can map one's home and the space around it.<\/p><p>Around the same time, Facebook also announced it was shutting down its facial recognition system and deleting its huge trove of face data that it had collected, which includes the faceprints of around 1 billion people.  On the surface, this was welcomed.  It seemed like a positive move.  A couple of years previously, Mr. Zuckerberg made a statement promising that the future is private, and it might have seemed that he was fulfilling that promise.  In reality, the only reason Facebook is deleting its face data is because regulators, policy-makers and citizens were slowly catching up with it.<\/p><p>In Illinois in 2020, Facebook was sued for its use of people's faceprints to suggest tags and had to pay &euro;650 million to settle that class action.  Seven states and over 20 cities in the US have limited government use of facial recognition tech amid fears over civil rights violations, racial bias and invasion of privacy.  It took a long time for regulators to catch up with facial recognition technology.  Bureaucracy and politics move slowly, and Facebook knows this.  In short, facial recognition has finally become a regulatory headache for Facebook, attracting huge amounts of scrutiny. <\/p><p>Last week it was reported in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>that Facebook has been applying for patents for new technology, which will be used in the metaverse.  These new technologies will track one's eye movements and facial expressions.  Effectively, what we have here is the removal of facial recognition, but a new way to get around policy through loopholes and introduce something similar, but done through sensory features.  There is no reason why this technology cannot store new types of prints, perhaps generated from a person's movements or other physical features.  Perhaps they will not be called faceprints, but they will be called something else.  <\/p><p>There are many other sinister purposes that the metaverse sensors will be put to.  For example, some of these sensors are designed to scan the inside of one's home.  These sensors might detect where objects are inside one's home and therefore what it can sell to people.  <\/p><p>Facebook's strategy to be able to keep collecting and exploiting our data is to pretend it is no longer collecting the data and then simply collecting it and exploiting it in a completely different way.  It is deleting its face data while working on new ways to extract biometric data from us.  The problem here is that tech evolves faster than we can regulate it.  On this basis, it is crucial that, as policy-makers, we are proactive about this.  I would like to call for a debate in this Chamber on artificial intelligence, the metaverse, facial recognition and its new technology in terms of sensory printing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#M00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I wish to highlight my huge concerns regarding the actions of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, agriculture minister.  It is very concerning that he would go on a solo run to obstruct, increase tensions and order workers at ports to break the law and cease checks that were put in place by an international agreement passed by both parties to that agreement, namely, the UK Government and the EU.  These are sinister electioneering tactics by the DUP.  This morning we heard that the DUP First Minister will apparently resign this afternoon, which is another tactic.  It is shocking and it is an absolute betrayal of people, businesses and the communities, never mind a breach of international law.<\/p> <p>The UK Government needs to intervene and the EU needs to stand up strong against this.  It needs to stand up and accept that Brexit is actually happening.  It is actually the largest procrastinator regarding Brexit.  If the DUP had followed the original deal of the former Prime Minster, Theresa May, Brexit would have been done, oven-ready and cooked.  We probably would be on our way to digesting it at the minute if it had backed Theresa May.  An awful lot of the DUP's problems at the minute are its own fault.<\/p> <p>I also want to highlight another campaign - a positive campaign.  I am referring to the Count Her In campaign that will be launched tomorrow on the birthday of my hero, Constance Markievicz.  When I was growing up, Constance Markievicz was a portrait on my wall and I took my confirmation name as Constance.

We heard two representative experiences, the first being the Irish Thalidomide Association.  I do not need to explain that, except to say that it is shocking that in the 1970s these people were awarded medical cards and some of them are denied it because of their income.  We need to arrest that and I will pursue it.  In addition, the lived daily experience of people was impactful.  If one does not have a limb, how does one take one's blood pressure?  In addition, the excruciating pain they have to go through in just having blood taken when they do not have an arm.  People are not insured to take blood from legs.  Their lived experience is quite excruciating and we need to have a tailored response to it.  I echo their calls. <\/p> <p>We also had a wonderful woman called Ms Elaine Dennehy in to speak about how she is in permanent lockdown because of the use of light-emitting diode, LED, bulbs.  She cannot leave her home because there are traffic lights at the end of her road.  She lived in the town, but had to move out of the town.  She cannot leave the end of her street because the LED lights and the traffic lights cause her such excruciating pain and illness.  To back it up, to be fair to her, there was also an organisation called LightAware.  <\/p> <p>Ms Dennehy cited an EU opinion from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks that noted there is this phenomenon in response to LED lighting in communities.  The prevalence of its use is just making people's lives unlivable.  Germany has recognised this as a disability only recently, and a man has won a right to have incandescent light bulbs provided and supplied to him.  We can make arrangements locally for people and we should, but we need to have a debate and discussion on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#M00500","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue on the National Women's Council.

It refers to anyone \"who identifies\" as a woman - not anyone who is a biological woman or is even legally registered or lives as a woman, including those who have medically transitioned from male to female.  It is just anyone who happens to feel like a woman at any given point.<\/p><p>The council was founded in 1973.  Imagine telling the women of the day back then that one day, the very definition of \"woman\" would be based purely on feeling and emotion rather than fact.  The council states that it wants no woman left behind but it will be leaving many women behind who no longer feel represented by it.  I certainly no longer feel represented.

No doubt she will do an excellent job.<\/p> <p>The issue I will raise again, which I have been talking about for a long time, is the concept of the three-day taxsaver flexi ticket for commuters.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, wrote to me last Friday to say that after 18 months of telling me it was going to introduce it, and telling me as recently as 18 December that it would do so at the end of the first quarter of 2022, it is not going to introduce it because it is too complex and financially difficult.  That is totally and utterly wrong.  It shows where commuters lie in the NTA's priorities.  We have had 18 months in which we have done colossal things in terms of introducing legislation overnight.  A flexi ticket should be something that can be easily introduced regardless of whether there is a pandemic.  To give one common example, I spoke to a friend of mine who was travelling twice on the train from Dundalk to Dublin this week.  It cost him &euro;64 for two return trips.  It would be cheaper for him to put &euro;50 in his tank and drive up and down the road.  We know we need to get people out of private cars and onto public transport.  Because the NTA is not willing to introduce this and said it will look at alternative options, it is actually cheaper and easier for someone to drive to Dublin and back.  I want to be very clear.  It is not the fault of the Minister either.  Devolved responsibility has been provided to the NTA.  It is something on which the NTA has been solely working.  After I have spent 18 months trying to work it through the official channels with the NTA, which has failed to deliver and pulled the plug at the eleventh hour, I would appreciate if we could speak to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I will speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to put some real ministerial pressure on the NTA.  If it is not going to reduce it, what is the alternative?  What is the next option?  How soon is it going to introduce it?  We need to get some affirmative action now.

It is a great honour.  A number of Senators mentioned the issue of credit unions and asked that the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, come into the House.  We should encompass the post office in that debate as well.  It was one of the financial institutions that stayed open fully through Covid and provided vital services to our communities, not just in rural areas but in urban areas and our cities.  It is important that it is supported in that.  I thank the Minister for Social Protection for the support she gave the post office with the moving of jobseekers' payments back into the network.  We were suffering a decline of 12% in social welfare payments out of the office network, which had a significant impact on the business being done.  It also impacted communities and the businesses around them.  I thank her for that support and look forward to continued support for the network.<\/p> <p>I raise the proposal for a new fire station in Ballymahon, County Longford.  At present an industrial unit beside a housing estate is being used.  The biggest tourism infrastructure project in the country has been developed in the area in Center Parcs, with over 2,500 people staying there every single week.  I am going there myself tomorrow with the kids and I am looking forward to it.  It is important that we have back-up for a project like that and that we have a proper fire service.  The local authority is identifying a site in the town in order to build that station but we need money from the Government to develop it.  I ask that that be prioritised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#O00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of Senator Pauline O'Reilly in the role of Acting Leader.  I have two questions, one of which is perfect for her and is right up her street.  First, I acknowledge the decision by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, last night and the work between him and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to lift that ban on burning.  It is important and that work by the Minister should be acknowledged and appreciated.<\/p> <p>Would it be possible to get a debate in the Seanad on cycleways and walkways and the amount of money the Minister for Transport has put towards them?  I would like him to outline how this money will be spent over the next number of years and his vision of what this can do for the country.  We have a beautiful blueway going from Clonmel to Carrick-on-Suir and because of the money the Minister has put in to design areas to expand it, it now looks like we will be able to expand the blueway onto the greenway in Waterford.  That is a huge advantage the region and the area because we all know how well-known the greenway in Waterford is.  To connect that to Clonmel, Cahir and the Rock of Cashel will bring huge added advantage.  Such a debate would be an opportunity for the Minister to explain the opportunity this brings to regions like mine in Tipperary.<\/p> <p>I also ask for an update on the sports capital grants and when they will be announced.  I could list a range of clubs that need money but it would take some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#O00300","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>The Senator does not have the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#O00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#O00500","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I mean that literally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#O00600","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>They are in Clonmel, Cahir and everywhere.

We have spent the last six years tirelessly working to find solutions for Brexit and to deal with the democratic will of the UK to leave the EU, even though the majority of people in the North of Ireland did not want it.  Now those who campaigned the hardest for Brexit, and for the hardest of Brexits, are obstructing the only mechanism they could agree on to make it happen, even though the majority of people in the North of Ireland support the protocol and making it work better for the entire community.  Yet again there is disregard for the community as a whole, as well as for rule of law.<\/p> <p>Speaking of which, my thoughts turn once again to the victims of the Troubles, with whom I, the Cathaoirleach and others met this morning.  The Truth and Justice Movement is a cross-community group of victims.  However, it really only represents one community, and that is the truth and justice community.  It is meeting the Taoiseach right now, following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week.  I am sure these people will receive the same assurances they got at that meeting that the Irish Government is utterly opposed to an amnesty.  That group achieved something that no other organisation on this island has done, namely, a consensus and a resolution, signed by all the main parties on this island, to oppose the amnesty.  That is quite an incredible achievement.  It is also the same in the UK.  All the parties except the Conservatives have supported this resolution and we want to bring that message to the White House to get support there as well.  I very much support the Truth and Justice Movement in its meeting today.

They will be the most shameful Olympic Games to have taken place since those in Berlin in 1936.  We all know about the ongoing human rights abuses in China, such as the Uighur genocide and what has been happening in Hong Kong.  Today I raise, in particular given it is an often forgotten conflict, the case of the people of Tibet.  Freedom House has stated the human rights abuses in Tibet rank only with those of Syria in terms of their seriousness.  It has found the Chinese Communist Party has oppressed the culture and language of the people of Tibet.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, indicated he will not attend the games, and I do not think we should give any diplomatic recognition to the games, but we also need to call out the sponsors of the games, one of which is Airbnb.  In China, because it follows the rules of the Chinese Government, it will not allow any of its premises there to be let to somebody from a Uighur or Tibetan background.  This is morally wrong.<\/p> <p>There are other commercial sponsors, such as Coca-Cola, Toyota, Panasonic, Intel and Proctor and Gamble.  All these commercial sponsors need to be called out for engaging in the propaganda purposes of the Chinese Communist Party.  What is going on in China before our eyes is disgraceful and disgusting.  The Irish Government has to stand up for the human rights of those who are being oppressed.  The Olympic Games is an event that should inspire all of us, but the fact it is going ahead at all in Beijing - I do not believe the athletes should be disadvantaged - is morally wrong and we need also to call out those commercial sponsors that are involved.  In this House, we have had strong debates on China.  We need to send that message clearly to the commercial sponsors as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#P00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>It is great to see Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly in the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s chair.

When I was growing up, there was no multi-denominational, co-educational secondary school there, and it is more than ten years since I supported a campaign for such a school.  This morning, I met people from Clonturk Community College, a secondary co-educational, multi-denominational school based in Whitehall.  It opened its doors in 2016 and is going from strength to strength.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for Education for this morning meeting the principal and the board of management, and I thank also the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  The school is a partnership between the Department of Education, the education and training board, Educate Together and the local community.  It has been a great success and I am delighted the Minister was today able to confirm it is on the major capital programme of the Department.  There is much ambition for the school and the Department is committed to the school having proper, purpose-built accommodation, with capacity for up to 1,000 students and up to four special educational needs, SEN, classes.

We recall when Sinn F&eacute;in pulled down the Northern Ireland Executive over the cash-for-ash scandal, which created a wave of unexpected consequences.  This time, if the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, pulls down the Executive, it will be far more complex, with many more challenges, and it will create considerable instability on the island of Ireland.  The issue definitely warrants a debate in this House in the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<\/p> <p>I welcome the announcement in recent days that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, will reform the planning laws to make it more straightforward and easier for people who wish to build houses to get planning permission to do so.  There is a housing crisis in this country, yet the planning system is tied up in knots.  It is time to unwind those knots, make planning straightforward and easy, and bring it into international best practice in order that houses can be built in the appropriate way and on appropriate sites.  It will mean people will not have to wait years to get planning permission to build houses.  The only way in which we will resolve the housing crisis is by providing houses.

I extend my condolences to the family of Eoin Collins, who did so much for Ireland and for equality.<\/p> <p>Senators O'Loughlin and McGreehan and others raised the Count Her In campaign, and a launch is taking place at the moment on the Leinster House plinth led by Women for Election.  We absolutely have to support women, men and those of all genders and it is welcome there is a campaign that seeks to increase the number of women in the Houses.  Although there are a large number of women in the Seanad, the same cannot be said for the D&aacute;il or at local authority level.  The issue of violence against women was raised and Senator O'Loughlin spoke about her family's experience, whereby her 12-year-old niece was attacked.  I agree we have to examine the causes within society.  We had a very good debate on the matter last week but we will have to return to it on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>Senator Ward raised a somewhat related issue, that is, the ability of defendants, as it stands, to cross-examine their accuser.  I agree we need to address that and consider whether it should really be an unfettered right to represent oneself, particularly when it comes to cross-examination.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of Cathal Brugha Barracks.  I listened to the Commencement matter raised by Senator O'Loughlin earlier and the fulsome response from the Minister for Defence.  To respond to Senator Boyhan's question, I am not entirely sure why the Defence Forces did not know about the feasibility study, although the Minister outlined that it was coming from his Department, which is seeking funding through Housing for All.  He indicated no decision has been made, so it might be worth reviewing his comments in that regard.  The Senator also sought an early debate on the commission&rsquo;s report, a request I can certainly pass on to the Leader.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about a Bill of which I am a signatory, the Safe Access to Termination of Pregnancy Services Bill 2021.  In some respects, I welcome the fact it is coming back before the House.  As he said, he was prompted to take action on the basis the Minister for Health has not progressed matters to the extent we would like.  Nevertheless, I welcome the scheduling of a debate next week on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane spoke about the issue of Facebook, in particular, and sought a debate on artificial intelligence, AI, and the metaverse, a request that was welcomed by other colleagues.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Seery Kearney sought a similar debate.  I agree that very often legislation is catching up with what is happening in real life.  There are sinister things happening in terms of how our data are being used.  I note that the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 will come before the House next week.  It might provide an opportunity to raise those issues, but quite apart from that there is need for a debate on the issue.<\/p><p>Senators McGreehan and &Oacute; Donnghaile and a number of other Senators raised the issues in regard to Northern Ireland.  Some of those Senators also raised other issues, which I will come to later.  It is very worrying that so close to an election Edwin Poots is engaging in cynical electioneering tactics in order to undermine the protocol, which has been signed up to.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has given a very good response, but we need to keep up the pressure there.  While I do not believe the steps that have been taken are representative of the views of Northern Ireland, they are putting pressure on workers.  That point was well made by Senator McGreehan.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney also raised the issue of LED lights and suggested a practical measure in this regard.  Complaints in regard to LED lights come to my attention from time to time.  Recognition of this as a disability may be the way to go in terms of providing some support.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about violence against women and made some comments about the National Women's Council of Ireland as an organisation.  Everybody is entitled to decide for themselves whether they want to sign up to the organisation on the basis of their values, in the same way as they do in regard to many other organisations across the State.  We should not stop funding an organisation that represents so many people.  Quite apart from that, I do not agree with Senator Keogan's views on the matter, but she is entitled to them.  I believe people are entitled to their own definitions and identities as they see fit.  That includes women.<\/p><p>Senators Gallagher, Murphy and Carrigy asked for a debate on credit unions.  Senator Carrigy sought to have that debate broadened to post offices.  We need to have a debate around credit unions and community banking, which are so much part of the culture of our communities across the country.  We need to expand our understanding of financial institutions.  <\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of Northern Ireland and he also addressed Senator Keogan's point, which I have just addressed.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon raised the NTA's response to proposed introduction of a three-day taxsaver ticket.  I am 100% supportive of the Senator's position on this issue.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on the matter.  I agree that something needs to be done.  If we are promoting flexible and hybrid working, we also have to ensure all of the things that support people getting to their workplace two or three days per week go hand-in-hand with that.  The position of the NTA is short-sighted.  As recognised by Senator McGahon, the institution is separate from the Minister.  I believe something should and can be done on that issue.<\/p><p>Senators Murphy and Ahearn raised the issue of a derogation on the burning of green waste on farms.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said a year ago that it would stop in time.  As I understand it, that is still the position.  The derogation has been signed for another year.  That provides us with an opportunity to come up with another solution.  We know that quite apart from anything else it impacts on air quality.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy also raised the issue of crime.  Returning to my university days, I know that the fear of crime can be just as damaging to people as the crimes.  It is important to highlight that issue.  Regardless of whether crime is rising or falling, it does not change the fact that people are concerned about crime. <\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne also raised the derogation on burning, which she welcomed.  She also welcomed the expansion of Vitalograph into Limerick and she spoke about roads funding, which is an issue of concern for many Senators, although Senator Byrne was the only Senator to raise it today.  All Senators worry about their own constituencies.  I have my own views, but there is a budget for new roads and there is a record amount of funding when it comes to safety on our roads.  I take on board Senator Maria Byrne's point.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, Senator Carrigy raised the issue of the credit unions and he also advocated for support for a fire station in Ballymahon.  I thank the Senator for raising that matter because communities need our advocacy.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn also spoke about the derogation.  I support his call for a debate on cycleways and walkways and how we can link blueways and greenways.  We need to have those links across the country.  I will ask the Leader to arrange that debate.  The Senator also asked for an update on sports capital grants, which we would all welcome.  We will seek an update from the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.<\/p><p>Senator Currie also raised the issue of the protocol and the consensus.  She spoke about the success that a really important organisation, The Truth and Justice Movement, has had in working on a consensus basis.  She also mentioned that the group is meeting with the Taoiseach today and that she would support the issue being raised to the White House.<\/p><p>The issue raised by Senator Craughwell was addressed by An Cathaoirleach so I will not go into that.  My understanding is that the Senator took on board An Cathaoirleach's point.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.  We have a good tradition in this House of speaking out against human rights violations, particularly in China.  In this instance, Senator Byrne raised the issue of Tibet.  It is welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will not be attending.  It is a good opportunity for commercial organisations to take a look at themselves and to consider whether their consumers are supportive of their sponsorship.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick raised the issue of multi-denominational, co-educational schools.  She mentioned Clonturk Community College, which is in her constituency of Dublin Central.  She spoke very passionately about her support for the roll-out of multi-denominational, co-educational schools across the country.  As many Senators will know, it is something I am very passionate about. <\/p><p>Senator Conway raised the issue of the reform of the planning system by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  I support reform of the planning system to unwind some of the knots.  As mentioned by Senator Conway, when it comes to planning for housing, greenways, cycleways and so on we are held up by a planning system that clearly is not fit for purpose.

I am delighted with the work that has been achieved in respect of the Bill thus far.  The phrase \"child pornography\" has always made me feel uneasy, but since becoming a mother I have realised how inappropriate and disgusting it is.  It is out of date and completely incorrect.  It does not truly reflect the nature of the abuse and it is unacceptable to continue using such inappropriate language when referring to such an awful crime.<\/p> <p>I thank Jessica Bray, Eimear Taylor and all my team for helping me put together the Bill, and say a big \"thank you\" to my Civil Engagement Group colleagues and Deputy Pringle for supporting me.  I thank also Mary Crilly, Caroline West and Vicky Conway for meeting me and working with my team on this legislation, and for the amazing work they do.  While researching for and drafting the Bill, there were many different language options to consider.  We originally used the term \"child sexual abuse material\" but we decided the term \"child sexual exploitation material\" better describes the many ways a child might face abuse.  We felt the word \"exploitation\" recognises how varied the abuse may be.  We must be clear: what is occurring here is exploitation.<\/p> <p>While drafting the Bill, we also came across possible legal issues with changing the Title of an Act, which had not been done before.  However, changing the Title of an Act does not change the reference number of the Act, so the Act can still be identified and referenced in this way.  There should be no issue with changing the Title of our legislation should we need to do so, and in this case, it was very necessary.  We can all think of words commonly used in the recent past that would now be recognised as offensive and divisive.  I would like to think that, should words written in our laws be harmful to people, we would not hesitate to amend or replace them.  This is the case here.  While \"pornography\" is not in itself a problematic word, it is used in the incorrect context where it is, in fact, abuse.  Where there is not consent, we must name it for what it is: exploitation, assault and abuse.<\/p> <p>In 2016, a global organisation that aims to tackle child trafficking and exploitation gathered an international working group of 18 international organisations.  The result was the Luxembourg Guidelines, which outlined the importance language can have in assisting and supporting victims and vulnerable people.  The group recognised the role of communications and the power of language and the guidelines recommended the term \"child pornography\" was incorrect.  As policymakers, we have a responsibility to ensure we use best-practice terminology.  This has been recognised at both an international level and a local level.<\/p> <p>I had the pleasure of speaking to representatives of the Fix It campaign this week, who have done great work in \"fixing\" Irish news headlines to use more appropriate language.  They go by the motto \"language matters\", and it does matter.  Language is a powerful tool and we need to ensure the language we use is appropriate and inclusive.  It is time this was recognised at a national level.  Language is a shared experience that allows us to communicate with one another.  Our words carry meaning and we must be careful about the terminology we use.  There can be no room for misunderstanding in legislation.  We must ensure we use correct and appropriate language.  The use of the phrase \"child pornography\" is incorrect and dangerous.  We need a phrase that better reflects the nature of the abuse and the crime.  We need to shift the focus from the victim to the perpetrator.  By changing the language of our laws, we can guide the narrative on these issues.<\/p> <p>Language shapes and defines our understanding, and the words we use are important.  The terminology we use is vital.  We must remove incorrect and harmful language from our legislation.  We need to ensure that how we speak about and recognise abuse is correct.  Let us get rid of the words \"child pornography\" from the Statute Book.  Our laws should be written to protect those they serve by implementing appropriate language that truly names the act of the crime.  We know that changing the Title of the Act in question is the right thing to do and that this really concerns child exploitation.  We must shine a light on the acts being suffered by countless children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eileen Flynn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is our job to protect children in this country.

What an important one it is.  There is the topic we are discussing itself, but even the conversation on language and its importance matters.  I congratulate the Senator's office as well for all the hard work done in respect of the essential piece of legislation before us.<\/p><p>The Bill is based on the Luxembourg best-practice guidelines on terminology and semantics for child protection.  The framework was written to promote the use of child-protective language and was compiled by 18 international partners, including Europol, Interpol and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  All these agencies recognise and make clear within the guidelines the importance of language when it comes to how we conceptualise problems, prioritise issues and forge responses, especially when it comes to cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse.  Every substitution of the term &quot;child pornography&quot; with &quot;child sexual exploitation material&quot; is a step towards Ireland and us, as legislators, being better equipped for dealing with the issue.  Each of the 26 substitutions this Bill makes engenders more clarity in the way we conceptualise, define and constructively engage with ending the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.  When I was thinking about what the language means and what pornography means, it is something that is active and that someone is engaging in.  It is like it is a category of something that someone just likes and that legitimises it.  Calling it child pornography legitimises it as an activity or something that is just a category of pornography.  That is why it is wrong and why we need to change it.  The concept that has been labelled child pornography to date is not pornography.  It is an oxymoron because what it refers to could never be described as pornography.<\/p><p>We might talk about language, what it means and where it originates from.  Pornography translates from Greek roots as<i>p&oacute;rn<\/i>, meaning &quot;prostitute&quot; and <i>gr&aacute;phein<\/i>, meaning to record.  What we are talking about is not prostitution.  There is not any consent.  There never could be consent because we are talking about children.  It is and always has been the sexual exploitation of children and the abuse of those children.  This is the key point.  The language we use does not just allow us to label what we see; the language we use shapes what we see because we use language as a frame to understand ideas.  Clear language allows us to take clear steps to address the issues before us.  What this Bill engages in, and what all our legislation should strive to engage with, is the linguistic concept of radical prescriptivism.  This is the concept that language should continually improve and adapt to better suit the world we live in today.  However, before we create order within the language we use, linguist Dr. Guy Deutscher suggests we must &quot;lead through alleyways of destruction&quot;.  In essence, the language we use in this Chamber and outside it should strive to articulate order within in chaos.  With the exponential growth of the Internet and the platform it provides for sharing of images of children being exploited and abused, it is more important than ever that we standardise the language we use when discussing it by using a universal and standardised definition of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.  By implementing Bills such as Senator Flynn's and standardising the language we use, it offers us a chance to work in concert with our international partners to fight these heinous crimes against children.  It also allows us to have a common starting point to engage with and counteract whatever new manifestations of abuse grow from the continued evolution of information and communications technologies.<\/p><p>I will conclude by saying we must keep it at the forefront of our minds at all times that the language we use within the Chamber is not for us but for the public.  Consequently, it should be accessible to the public.  As George Orwell wrote in his seminal Politics and the English Language:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe great enemy of clear language is insincerity.  When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink. <\/blockquote> <p>How many times have we come in here to debate a topic, started out by saying it is a technical Bill and then followed it with drawn-out speeches of similarly dense and inaccessible language?  We must remember that our role in this Chamber is not that of a lawyer or orator but a legislator.  In order to perform that role properly, the public on behalf of whom we are legislating must understand what we are legislating for because the words we utter today will affect them tomorrow.  It does not matter how flowery the speeches we make on various virtues or particular pieces of legislation are or how technically brilliant a piece of a Bill we bring forward in the House is.  If the public do not understand it, if its aims are not clear and its language inaccurate then it is not worth the paper it is written on.  I am asking Senators to support Senator Flynn's Bill and begin the process of making the language we use in this House clear, more accessible and to actually name what something is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#U00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome back to the House.

This is very fine legislation to bring forward.  The information we got brought me to looking at the Luxembourg guidelines and into an area of beginning to perhaps have the words needed to articulate many things around this that are very wise.  The opening of the press release that came with the Luxembourg guidelines when they were announced states: &quot;Words matter because they affect how we conceptualise problems, prioritise issues, and forge responses.&quot;  That is wonderful.  In the same press release, the UN Special Rapporteur on Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn the fight against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children, terminology is not just a matter of semantics: it determines the effectivity of responses.  The Luxembourg Guidelines will contribute not only to protecting children, but also in ending the impunity for these heinous crimes ... <\/blockquote> <p>It is really important, therefore, that we evolve our legislation as quickly as possible in order to ensure that we are up to date in our concepts and that we are ensuring we are capturing all that is happening, literally, to children and drawing a line between what is legal and illegal and lawful and unlawful.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have a concern regarding the point at which sexual exploitation can be said to begin.  This Bill should give us an opportunity to commence a national conversation on that.  We have a concept in our minds about pornography and child pornography and how heinous that is.  Having worked in criminal law I have seen some horrific cases.  We also need a wider debate on when the exploitation of children begins.  Hyper-sexualisation of children is constant in our society.  An excellent paper by the Generation for Rights Over the World, GROW, deals with this hyper-sexualisation of children.  We have to consider the exposure to pornography and the normalisation of pornography, and the fact that there are damaging acts that occur between allegedly consenting adults.  We know that children cannot consent so there is a very clear line there.  A national conversation is needed on what is all right.  Children, girls in particular, aged 12, 13 and 14 are put under pressure to engage in sexual acts.  They end up being photographed and there are consequences that flow from that.  Highly sexualised dolls in fishnet stockings are being marketed to six-year-olds.  Parents give them to their children - I have seen them come into my own house - because the child is part of the latest LOL trend, or whatever trend.  That removes something of the very clear boundary between childhood and adulthood, between what we are consenting to and what the maturity level is.  According to the GROW report:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe have seen that the hypersexualisation of [children] is a recent social phenomenon, but one that has intensified very quickly in Western countries, particularly through social networks, the film industry and pornography.  The sexism of these practices is also undeniable.  The law often remains powerless against this phenomenon, which particularly affects the new generations.  Series, films, reality shows, advertisements [there is a constant barrage of advertisements on children's TV programmes], magazines, music, toys, etc., are ... all excessively sexualised. <\/blockquote><p>In considering what I would say today, I considered the possibility of being a fuddy-duddy and of not being a trendy mom in raising this.  I look at it through the eyes of a six-year-old and think of the exposure these children have.  Our language matters.  The point at which sexual exploitation is beginning is something we need to have a very hard conversation on.  As a society, we need to reflect on what is tolerated.  This GROW report states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe hypersexualisation of girls is a form of violence against children: a physical violence of course, but also a symbolic (objectification of women's bodies), an economic (exploitation, transformation into a sexual object) and even a political (lack of government intervention to limit these excesses of [the commercialisation and targeting of childhood]) one. <\/blockquote><p>We need to regularise the toy industry to ensure we do not have this hyper-sexualisation.  I commend this excellent Bill.  I am delighted that we are supporting it.  In the context of the consultations with the Attorney General, we need to start considering where exploitation actually begins, and whether it begins with this hyper-sexualisation of children, especially young girls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#U00400","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see the Child Trafficking and Child Sexual Exploitation Material (Amendment) Bill 2022 before the House today.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend Senator Flynn on bringing this Bill before us on Second Stage.  She mentioned earlier this week that this is her first Private Members' Bill.  It is a very important one and I commend her on it.<\/p> <p>No matter the circumstances, language and terminology are crucial in shaping how people understand themselves and view the world.  Using the wrong language and terminology often distorts the mind and can be a source of racism, sectarianism, sexism, homophobia and many other reactionary and base sentiments and behaviour.  The rape crisis centres support the use of clear and stronger terminology, as does the Fixed It campaign.  Both organisations have issued guidelines to the media advising it to use the correct terminology when covering cases dealing with trafficking, exploitation and gender-based violence.  The justice system must also play its part and ensure its sentencing guidelines reflect the seriousness of sexual crimes against children.  At its heart this Bill is about protecting children.  To prevent children being trafficked and sexually abused has to be key aim for the Government and for law enforcement agencies.  <\/p> <p>This Bill is about using the correct terminology to describe it and, on that basis, enacting the provisions to ensure the law is effective in its aim and in its purpose.  It seeks to replace the term \"child pornography\" with the term \"child sexual exploitation material\".  If it is approved here today and on further Stages, it will create the following new titles: Child Trafficking and Child Sexual Exploitation Material (Amendment) Acts 1998 to 2021 and Child Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation Material (Amendment) Act 2004.  The proposed changes are based on best practice as outlined in the Luxembourg guidelines.  If adopted they will ensure that policies, laws and legislation use language and terminology that best serves those in need of protection.  In this instance, the legislation focuses on children who are victims of sexual exploitation material or what would have been referred to as pornography.  Pornography is the wrong word.  It implies consent.  In the context of protecting children, its use ignores the heinous nature of the abuse and the crime.<\/p> <p>The language change will refocus the crime clearly onto sexual assault images that are recorded or shared, obviously without consent.  We live in an Internet era.  It provides a whole new set of circumstances and difficulties when it comes to illegal images and access to them, and how society organises itself in this field to protect children, who are those most vulnerable to exploitation.  Laws not only outlaw abusive behaviour; they also assist in reframing people's understanding of what abusive behaviour looks like and how it is to be dealt with, a clearer understanding of what consent means in reality and the part that sex education plays in deepening people's awareness.  A more comprehensive understanding of consent and abuse will surely help in combating that abuse.  Punitive laws are of course essential but so too are correct and putative language which sharply and clearly defines the problem.  It is not pornography; it is abuse.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#V00300","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House today.  I will start by congratulating Senator Flynn on the introduction of her first Bill.  As a fellow new Senator, I know of the honour it is to introduce and discuss one&rsquo;s first Bill.  Today, I am sure, is a day on which Senator Flynn can be justifiably proud.  In introducing her first Bill, Senator Flynn addresses serious outdated terminology in our Statute Books that have become associated with a dreadful and awful crime.  As a parent, and there are many parents in the House today, this is a nightmare scenario that many of us cannot even contemplate.  That is why it needs to be called out for exactly what it is.  I welcome the fact that Senator Flynn has introduced this today.  As Senator Flynn stated, this is exploitation and it should be described as such and simply as that.  Referring to it as &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo;, as other colleagues have said, implies a level of consent that does not and can never exist, in my opinion.  It fails to recognise the disgusting harm to the victims and the inherent trauma perpetrated against them.  It is simply that.  It is harm and it is perpetrated against them.  The term &ldquo;child abuse&rdquo; is correct and allows for more accurate reporting, especially in our media.  That is an important part of what Senator Flynn is trying to introduce today.  That is where it needs to start.  That is where this conversation needs to happen.  I am sure that this is one reason Senator Flynn has proposed such legislation today.  It also correctly places the perpetrators of this abuse in the category of child abusers, where they rightly belong.<\/p> <p>As Senator Flynn says, language is important.  Other colleagues have said that as well.  In supporting the Bill, it is important that the current language, which is outdated and incorrect, is replaced.  it is simply exploitation.  It is simply abuse.  That is what it is.  It needs to be changed.  In supporting Senator Flynn today, I welcome her bringing forward of this important Bill forward and I look forward to discussing it further as it progresses through the House.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#W00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Flynn on her Bill.  I was pleased, while acting as Leader of the House on Tuesday, to be able to accept the amendment to the Order of Business in order that Senator Flynn could introduce this Bill today.  I am doubly pleased to support it on the floor now.<\/p> <p>Senator Flynn&rsquo;s opening of this conversation has been phenomenal.  It was the first time that I myself thought about the need to change the language around this.  This is because while the term &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; is horrific, awful and none of us wants to think about it, we do have to deal with it.  Looking at the language and phrases and recognising the importance of language and words, as well as the importance of including language that is more reflective of this reprehensible type of behaviour, is certainly very worthy.  I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, is here to listen and to debate all of the issues around it.  It is appreciated, of course, that the Government supports the principle of this Bill. <\/p> <p>The Senator is talking about taking the words &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; from the Statute Book and replacing them with references to &ldquo;child sexual exploitation material&rdquo;.  This is correct, because the term &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; is probably outdated.  When we reflect on it, it needs to be replaced with a term such as that which Senator Flynn has outlined.  Sometimes it is hard to reflect in the language that is used in a cold Statute Book to paint the vista of the full horror of what is involved in the offences that deal with the images of and the sexual abuse of children.  We need to do that.  We need to be able to try to show within our words and within our Statute Book the horror that something like this brings on board.  <\/p> <p>On the exploitation piece, the conversation needs to go wider than that.  This is because we have to look at instances of children being groomed.  Will grooming be to be covered by this?  Senator Seery Kearney referred to this when she was talking about the exposure of children to pornography, as well as their exposure through their mobile phones to highly sexualised clothing, music, activity etc.  I remember a few years ago, as I sought to buy some clothes for my young niece as a birthday present, asking myself whether I was being a real fuddy-duddy.  That was because I was quite shocked - and this was for an eight-year-old - by the terms that were written on the clothes, such as &ldquo;sex&rdquo; and &ldquo;sexy&rdquo;.  I thought it was not appropriate and I believe it is not appropriate.  We need to have an honest conversation, not just in here but within society and within our communities.  I remember talking to the mother of a young teenager about clothes who thought that - I am not knocking her at all for this - her daughter had a lovely figure and it was nice to show it off, and fair play.  However, sometimes, we need to be conscious of oversexualisation.  That is not taking away from somebody&rsquo;s right to wear what he or she wants or to be able to express his or her own identity.  While I might be saying this in clumsy language, I am trying to get that sense across.<\/p> <p>I accept that the Government must consult with the Office of the Attorney General, which of course is always important.  I know the Senator would want any legislation to completely true to its spirit and that it will be in a situation where it will not be contested etc.<\/p> <p>Our society is a different society than it was.  There certainly are systemic issues regarding abuse.  Consent and sex education come into this as well.  Senator Ruane and I worked on the education committee's proposal for a new approach to sex education, which is needed.  We made 18 strong recommendations on which the present Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, is working.  It is a priority for us to look at that and to bring them in.  As a society and as a community, we need to look at what we regard or understand as what constitutes abusive behaviour.  I will leave it at that.  I thank the Minister of State for being here and I congratulate Senator Flynn again. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#W00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>In the first instance, I welcome this Bill.  I congratulate Senator Flynn on the work she has done on this, which is clearly extensive.  It is not an easy task to approach the Statute Book with a view to carrying out an amendment that will cover all the bases.  It is an arduous task to go through it.  We can see that from the fact that a statute law revision project within the Office of the Attorney General has been going on for 20 years now.  It is a long way away from making serious inroads into the massive volume of legislation of the past, much of which predates Ireland as a State.  However, some of the legislation needs to be updated and changed.  It is therefore welcome and laudable when an individual Member of the House takes the time, effort and enormous work that is concerned in embarking on a project like this.  I therefore thank Senator Flynn and I congratulate her for that work.<\/p><p>I am just thinking about some of the speeches here, some of which mentioned the use of language and its importance.  I am thinking of other terms that exist in legislation, because that term &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; is not the only outdated term in our legislation.  There are many others.  It would not be fair to expect Senator Flynn to have gone through every piece of legislation and to have identified all the appalling terms.  However, for example, the Aliens Act, is a really silly title and it is totally outdated.  This nomenclature is not used any more.  Even thinking about this area of child abuse and child sexual exploitation, when I worked here as a non-Member of the Houses, at one time there was a CC <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case in the Supreme Court, which struck down section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That offence was unlawful carnal knowledge; an extraordinarily genteel term for rape of a child.  One of the things at the centre of this debate and Bill and the work that has been done by Senator Flynn is the importance of calling things what they are.  Reference was made to the Fix It campaign.  That is tremendously important.  I was looking through one of our national newspapers and saw the headline that read, \"Man who impregnated girl, 15, who he thought was his daughter jailed for 12 years after pleading guilty to rape\".  That creates so many problems, as if somehow the fact he thought she was his daughter qualified it in any way and instead he pleaded guilty to rape.<\/p><p>Calling these things what they are is tremendously important.  We are behind the curve on these issues.  Even the original legislation that is being amended by this Bill is from 1998.  This material predates 1998.  In fact, for a long time in this country, there was a view that this kind of child exploitation material was victimless.  There is an extraordinary difference between not being able to identify the victim and suggesting that it is victimless.  We know that even if the child who is being exploited by these materials is in the Philippines, the United States or Ireland, that child is still a victim and will bear the scars and damage of that exploitation for the rest of his or her life.<\/p><p>It is incredibly important for these Houses to not only acknowledge that these are serious matters, and I believe the law does that, but also to call them for what they are.  The term \"language is important\" was used earlier.  It absolutely is.  We have seen that in many other areas too but calling it what it is important.  It is not child pornography; it is child sexual exploitation material.  It is not underage sex; it is rape of a minor.  It is not non-consensual sex; it is rape.  Call it what it is because until we do, we do not understand what it is.  It is incredibly important that the law calls it what it is because then we are sending out a really clear signal that we, as a State and a body politic, know and understand what it is and we are not going to stand for it.<\/p><p>Many speakers said today that they do not want to think about this material, which totally understandable, and they have not thought about the material.  That is also understandable.  Unfortunately, in my professional life, I have thought about this material.  I have been involved in a number of cases involving child exploitation material.  I can say that generally speaking, in the context of the courtroom, the terms that is used is \"child exploitation material\".  Obviously, the legislative term is different and that will be referred to but in terms of discussing the issue, we generally use that term.  There is a very clear understanding at that level of the damaging nature of this material and the incredible damage it does, not only to the victim of the actual exploitation but also to everybody who sees it.  They are also damaged, whether they realise it or not.  The call in this legislation, which is clarion in nature, is that we call it out for what it is and show we understand what it is and that we will not accept it.  It is tremendously important.  Once again, I want to put on the record my praise and admiration for Senator Flynn in terms of the work that is being done here.  I welcome the fact that Government is accepting this Bill.  I look forward to it becoming law so we can stop using that awful term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#W00400","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Flynn on this legislation and, indeed, Ms Jessica Bray in her office and all those whom I know worked closely with her and, of course, the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, the Bills Office and others who have supported the work.<\/p> <p>I am incredibly proud to have Senator Flynn as part of our Civil Engagement Group.  In the course of this Seanad, she has shown herself to be an incredibly strong leader in public debate, as a public representative and as somebody who drives, questions, challenges and brings forward debate in that part.<\/p> <p>Today, we are also seeing her make an incredibly strong contribution in that other really important part of our work as Senators, which is as legislators.  The legislative work all of us take on, and that role and responsibility we have in the Oireachtas of shaping and stewarding the laws and, where necessary, challenging and updating them, which is so important.  This is a really important legislative contribution.<\/p> <p>I this Bill will pass soon, quickly and in its full Stages.  Seven separate pieces of the laws of our land will be immensely improved by the passing of this Act, and, as Senator Ward pointed out, it is quite an achievement to improve seven laws at once.  It is really important in that regard.<\/p> <p>Laws reflect experience but they also shape experience.  Similarly, language can reflect experience but it can also shape experience.  That is what is being tackled here in both.  We know the damage language can do and what the wrong word used in the wrong way can do.  We also know there is a very important power in naming , that is, when we properly express and name a problem or elephants in the room, and talk about experiences.  Sometimes, it is using the right word.  It is not just the absence of the wrong word.  Using the true language can be very powerful and important.<\/p> <p>We saw that in similar areas in this House.  When we talked about coercive control and this House made changes on that, it was important in terms of naming it as an offence but also in terms of naming it as a thing and as part of real lived experience.  It was also very important that the phrase \"revenge porn\", which used to be used, was completely moved away from and instead we talk about what it is, which is image-based sexual abuse, and name it as such.  That is important.<\/p> <p>In this context, every time the wrong phrase is used - every time the phrase \"child pornography\" is used - it is damaging.  Many people talk about not wanting to think or talk about it but those who are thinking and talking about it should be able to.  It was really interesting that Senator Flynn said the phrase people want to use when they talk about it in courts is to name it as \"child sexual exploitation material\" or \"abuse material\".  I have spoken to journalists who get contacted every time they report and use the phrase \"child pornography\" because people say that is not the right phrase.  They know it is not the right phrase but it is what is in the laws.  Multiple conversations, therefore, get affected.  And then, for those who have experienced abuse and exploitation as children, every time they hear the phrase \"child pornography\", that is damaging.  That is why we want campaigns like Fix It to not have to use their energy in fighting how the phrasing is used.  We can also be pooling our energies towards the actual task at hand, which is ending and fighting child sexual abuse and exploitation.  It is really important in this regard and has a very real affect.<\/p> <p>I will point to another reason this legislation is important.  We talked about pornography.  One of the problems with that word for me, which other people have spoken about, is that it points towards the imagined viewer rather than, as this Bill clearly states, material evidence of a crime that has been committed in sexual exploitation and of something awful that has been done to a child or that a child has experienced.  Many of the Acts that are being amended by this important Bill today predate the referendum we had on the rights of the child in Ireland.  That is a really important point too.<\/p> <p>When we talk about the rights of the child, the child needs to be at the centre.  I know and understand people are speaking as being parents and caring for the child.  We all have a role in terms of protection.  When we talk about protection, we absolutely have a role in terms of having laws that protect and vindicate the rights of the child.  The child must be at the centre.  Children's rights and, indeed, their experience and power should be at the centre.  That is why it was good that we mentioned, for example, the work Senator Ruane and others have done around consent education and empowering sexual education in our schools.  It is about making sure that children, as citizens of the country, see laws that care about, reflect and empower them and speak authentically to their experience.  It is a really positive Bill.  I am delighted that it is moving forward today.  I urge the Government to help us create space within the schedules of the Seanad and D&aacute;il to move it through as rapidly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#X00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Flynn, Higgins, Ruane and Black for bringing forward this very important Bill.  I understand it is Senator Flynn&rsquo;s first Bill.  I congratulate her hugely on bringing forward this very important legislative contribution.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want to acknowledge the very genuine intentions of all of the sponsoring Senators in bringing forward this Bill.<\/p><p>The objective of this Bill is to remove from the Statute Book language that is outdated and fails to reflect the full horror of the sexual abuse involved in images of child sexual exploitation.  In her remarks, Senator Flynn has eloquently explained why the language that is currently used on the Statute Book is problematic, at the very minimum, and why it should be and needs to be changed.  I fully agree with her.<\/p><p>Senator Flynn has correctly stated the importance of the use of correct and appropriate language.  Images of child sexual abuse are not &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;.  Pornography is a term used for adults engaging in consensual sexual acts.  As Senator Ruane has outlined the etymology of the language as well.  The either-or definition is not appropriate for what this is.  These are child sexual abuse images.  They are images of appalling crimes committed against vulnerable children.  They involve children who cannot and would not consent, and who are victims of a crime.  Such images are not only a record of the initial crime perpetrated against the child but the images themselves continue to harm and victimise the child each time they are shared or viewed.  I agree with the Senator that it is important that we name such images for what they are - images of child sexual exploitation.  For this reason the Government is not opposing the Senator's Bill today.<\/p><p>As Senator Seery Kearney rightly pointed out, this is not just an issue of semantics.  Equally, Senator Ruane pointed out that language should be clear and accessible, especially in these Houses.  Linguistics are important and can be determinative.  Senator O'Loughlin also put the situation into a wider context of concerns about the over sexualisation of young people.  This is not the first time that this issue has been raised.  Officials in my Department, and in the Office of the Attorney General, have previously considered how it can be addressed.  Appealing as it may be to propose the straightforward replacement of the offending words with more appropriate terms, it is unfortunately not so simple.  There are some very significant problems with the approach.<\/p><p>The Senator has already highlighted the importance of language, and the effect that it can have on how we view and interpret things, which is doubly true in law.  Every word in legalisation has a purpose and a meaning.  While I know that it is not the Senator&rsquo;s aim to alter the nature of the offences she proposes amending, the act of changing the words does alter the offence.  In altering the offence, a risk is created regarding prosecutions that are already under way and to future prosecutions that may be brought for offences committed before the change in wording.<\/p><p>A significant portion of the amendments proposed in this Bill are to substantive serious offence provisions.  Great care needs to be taken in making changes to such offences that no unintended consequences arise.  Unfortunately, there may be quite serious unintended consequences arising from these proposals.<\/p><p>The Constitution clearly prohibits creating offences which were not offences at the time of their commission.  I understand, of course, that this Bill does not aim to do that but without transitional and saving provisions for each offence that the Bill proposes to amend, the effect of the Bill could be interpreted as removing the existing offence and replacing it with a new one.  The old offence will no longer exist and the new one cannot apply to offences committed before the Act but not yet prosecuted.  It may be that the courts would not interpret the change to the wording of the offence in that way but, at the very least, the amendments could create the unintended consequence of creating technical loopholes for offenders to challenge prosecutions and convictions and, potentially, evade justice.  I have no doubt that no one in this House wants or intends that outcome.<\/p><p>Other amendments are to Acts which reference what could be characterised as the \"source\" offence of child sexual exploitation material.  For example, the Bill seeks to amend the Schedule to the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, which provides for mandatory reporting where a person has information that certain offences have been committed against a child.  Again, careful consideration of ongoing prosecutions, and potential transitional provisions, are required to ensure that the reporting requirement is not inadvertently removed regarding offences committed prior to the change in language, and to ensure the safety of prosecutions under that Act for failure to comply with the reporting obligations.  Similar issues arise with reporting obligations under the Children First Act.<\/p><p>The Bill, in section 9, proposes amending the Schedule to the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  The Schedule to that Act determines the offences for which a convicted person is subject to the reporting requirements in the Act.  If that Act is amended to remove the existing offences which relate to &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; then a person who has a conviction for such an offence will no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of that Act.  The reporting requirements under the Sex Offenders Act are important safeguards to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can monitor and manage the risk posed by convicted sex offenders.  Caution must be exercised before making changes to this Act as it applies to those who already have convictions.  It is not possible to retrospectively alter the offence for which a person has been convicted.  Senators will appreciate that these are serious risks that could have consequences for the effectiveness of our laws in respect of very serious offences.<\/p><p>In addition, there are a number of more technical issues with the Bill.  I am advised by the Office of the Attorney General that there are technical difficulties relating to the amendment of the Short Title and Long Title of the Bill.  It is a matter of drafting convention that titles are not amended.  It is, of course, open to the Oireachtas to dispense with that convention if there is a pressing need to do so but they do serve a purpose.  Adhering to drafting conventions, particularly regarding the titles of Acts, provides a degree of legal certainty in interpreting references to those Acts in amending legislation, case law and debates in these Houses.  All of those things are important for the courts, and the public in understanding, and interpreting the intent and application of our laws and the offences contained within them.<\/p><p>There are also difficulties with amending section titles or \"shoulder notes\" which do not, in law, stand part of an Act.  As such it is not clear whether the proposed amendments to section notes would have any legal affect.  Of course the wording is hugely important.  Finally, there is a lack of precision in the identification of the provisions to be amended.<\/p><p>As I have said, none of these points are meant to be a criticism of the Senator or of the Bill in and of itself.  The intentions of the Bill are very much accepted.  The Senators should be applauded for bringing forward this Bill.<\/p><p>As I have said, I fully agree with the objective that the Senators are trying to achieve with this Bill and for that reason, the Government is not opposing this Bill on Second Stage.  However, there are significant legal and technical issues that do need to be addressed.  These are issues that could jeopardise the prosecution of offences for child sexual abuse material and related reporting, and post-conviction obligations if they are not addressed and do need careful consideration.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators, in particular Senator Flynn, for bringing forward this legislation.  The Minister for Justice looks forward to working with the Senator further on this piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020300002#X00300","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643884200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and call on the proposer, Senator Flynn, who has five minutes to conclude.
