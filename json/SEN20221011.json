The issue on the table is the exclusion of those aged 18 to 20 from participating in the community employment, CE, scheme.  It is generally accepted that the Government should reward the behaviour we want to encourage in our citizens, and being an active citizen in our economy is one such behaviour we should champion.  While this has been the case for years, the events of budget 2023 led me to think about what message the Government is trying to achieve through the CE scheme.  Budget 2023 saw a &euro;5 increase in the CE top-up payment from &euro;22.50 to &euro;27.50 from January 2023.  Meanwhile those in receipt of a weekly jobseeker's payment will receive an increase of &euro;12 per week.<\/p> <p>The CE scheme is designed to help people who are long-term unemployed or otherwise disadvantaged to get back to work by offering part-time or temporary placements in jobs based within local communities.  Participants can take up other part-time work during the CE placement.  The work is community based.  The training provided through CE is delivered with a quality assurance framework.  When a person's CE placement ends, the person is encouraged to seek a job elsewhere using the skills, experience and training gained while participating in the CE scheme.  The duration of a CE scheme placement is for 12 months, with some exceptions.  The general qualifying age for CE is 21.  There are exceptions to this, of course.  The CE drug rehabilitation programmes are available for persons aged 18 or over who are in recovery or referred for a rehabilitation place on a CE scheme.  Members of the Traveller and Roma communities can qualify from the age of 18.  Ex-offenders aged 18 or over are referred by the following agencies: the Probation Service, the linkage service, the gate service, the resettlement service and the Irish Prison Service.  Refugees aged 18 or over who are authenticated by the Department of Justice, have a valid work permit or Garda National Immigration Bureau card with stamp 4 and are in receipt of any Department of Social Protection payment for any length of time, can quality for a CE scheme.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to advise whether the current influx of refugees over the age of 18 will be in a position to take up a CE scheme.  After all, this would encourage social integration of refugees within communities.  The current social welfare payment for 18-year-olds is &euro;117.70.  This payment will increase to &euro;129.70 in January 2023.  Approximately 20,000 people under the age of 25 were getting jobseeker's allowance at the end of September 2022.  Why are we saying to 18-year-olds, 19-year-olds and 20-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training that they cannot avail of our work support scheme, and all they can do is collect their dole money?  It is not empowering to our young people to reward them for doing nothing.  It is lazy governance.  As a Government, we must do better for our teens and our young people.  One will never get a career or an opportunity by lying in bed all day and we should not reward it either.  Given that the take-up of CE and T&uacute;s programmes is at an all-time low, surely these programmes should be opened up for this age cohort as a matter of urgency.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#B00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Keogan for raising this issue.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, who could not make it to the debate.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the excellent work that is done on the full range of schemes supported by the Department, including community employment schemes, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, and the contribution these schemes and their workers make to communities throughout the county.  We see in every county, and the Senator and I certainly see it in our county of Meath, high participation across the schemes.<\/p> <p>Currently, more than 26,000 participants and 1,635 supervisors are employed on the three main schemes.  Overall, these schemes have a budget allocation of &euro;540 million in 2022.  Work schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s are positive initiatives that enable the long-term unemployed to make a positive contribution to their communities while upskilling for prospective future employment.  The role they play in our communities is well recognised.  At present, more than 18,500 places are supported on community employment, with a budget of over &euro;375 million available to support the scheme in 2022.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and I announced reforms to the community employment scheme on 21 December 2021 and again on 29 June last.  These changes were introduced to improve the operation of the employment support schemes and maintain vital services within our communities.  These changes included provision to allow community employment scheme participants who reach 60 years of age to remain on the scheme until they reach State pension age.  Reducing the age from 62 to 60 to allow participants to remain on the community employment scheme until they reach State pension age was considered on the basis that this cohort of participants is least likely to progress to employment in the open labour market.  It was also part of a type of consultation based on a number of visits by the Minister, the Minister of State and me to the community enterprise offices and community employment offices, engagement with supervisors and managers over a long period as well as many debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have had considerable discussion on this matter in recent years.  We all see the value of these schemes to our communities and to people in their 60s who want to stay in schemes and do not want to have to go back into the work environment.<\/p> <p>Currently, 27% of community employment scheme participants are between the ages of 60 and 66 and almost half of community employment scheme participants are aged over 55.  Community employment was originally only open to participants over the age of 25 until a change was introduced by the Department of Social Protection back in 2017, which reduced the eligible age for participation to where it is today, at 21 years.  However, the community employment scheme is already available to those in receipt of disability-related payments and is also available to members of the Traveller and Roma communities, refugees, ex-offenders and inhabitants of offshore islands from the age of 18.<\/p> <p>All places on the drugs rehabilitation CE scheme are available to persons aged 18 years or over who are in recovery and referred for a rehabilitation place on a community employment scheme.  While the scheme is not open to all customers between the ages of 18 and 21, a wide range of supports in the Department of Social Protection is available to this cohort of young people.  It is certainly not the case that there are no supports or that these young people are left to their own devices.  These supports include T&uacute;s, the work placement experience programme and the JobsPlus scheme, along with a broad range of education and training programmes.  I ask any young person in this age cohort to engage directly with the Department of Social Protection and the Intreo offices because a team of caseworkers is ready to work with and assist them on a journey back to work or into a training course or work placement experience programme.<\/p> <p>At every business event I attend on behalf of the Department, I stress the importance of giving young people a chance through these schemes and that supports are available to assist the future employee as well as the employer.  Strong subsidies are available to both sides to make it worthwhile for everybody to engage with these supports, no matter what age they are, and to follow the pathways to work programme set out in the document.<\/p> <p>To give an example, T&uacute;s is an employment support scheme, similar to community employment, and, as I mentioned, it is open to those between the ages of 18 and 21.  It is worth looking at the participants in that scheme to give some background on research for the lowering of the age on CE schemes.  The level of participation on T&uacute;s for 18- to 21-year-olds is just over 3% and for 22- to 25-year-olds, it is just over 6%.  To be clear, the Senator is asking us to open up schemes for which there does not seem to be great demand because the age group in question avails of the other support schemes, generally the work placement experience programme.  The low take-up figures for T&uacute;s indicate that such an employment support scheme is not a preferred option for this age group.  Coupled with the range of other educational, training and work placements available to this age group, this indicates that extending community employment schemes to all customers in this age group would not make an appreciable difference to participation rates.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The live register figures show that 63% of long-term unemployed jobseekers are between the ages of 25 and 54.

I necessarily agree that we should encourage everybody who is able to work to do so if at all possible.  That is why every effort is made by the Government, including the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to make the case that work always pays and should always pay.  That is why much of the work of the Government in the past two and a half years has been on strengthening pay and conditions and the work environment.  The protections are in place.  There is sick pay legislation coming into effect, there is auto-enrolment, and the minimum wage has gone up by 80%.  Therefore, every effort is being made to make sure it is worthwhile going to work.  In the majority of cases, it absolutely is.  A range of supports is available to the cohort in question to take up work or obtain training and skills.  We constantly work to encourage people to take up work.  There are extra caseworkers assigned under Pathways to Work to work with the newly unemployed or long-term unemployed so they can find their way back into work, avail of the supports and join up the dots.<\/p> <p>The job placement programme is a really useful one to encourage people to get used to a work environment again and get close to a job.  We try to encourage everyone to participate in the schemes.  When someone is at work, everyone generally benefits, including the community, business and the person&rsquo;s family.<\/p> <p>With regard to the payments of &euro;12, the response in the budget is a cost-of-living initiative to recognise that everyone on a fixed income, regardless of the reason, is under extreme pressure when it comes to paying bills.  Likewise, anybody who is going to work is also under pressure.  That is why we made changes to the tax system, the working family payment and other payments, again recognising there is a cost-of-living pressure.  The argument in this regard is different from the argument as to who can avail of what scheme in normal times.  That is what the response is about.<\/p> <p>Pathways to Work is a document that tries to focus our efforts on encouraging everybody who could be at work but who is not to return to work.  It is to make it easier for them.  Everybody has a unique story, and our caseworkers understand that.  The range of schemes allows the journey to happen in different ways for different people.  I encourage everybody not in work to return to work through education, training, placements or apprenticeships.  There is a range of initiatives.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, is very much behind these and driving them, along with other key Departments, including the Department of Education and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#D00500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scientific Research","time":1665495000,"counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#E00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#E00150","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  We are discussing Ireland's membership of CERN, which is arguably the world's greatest scientific laboratory and certainly engages some of its greatest scientists, engineers and technicians.  I am glad to welcome to the Public Gallery several researchers who have a specific interested in this issue.  As the Minister of State is aware, CERN is focused on how our universe is made up.  It has been responsible for some of the things we take for granted in many ways, including the World Wide Web, touchscreens, positron emission tomography scanners in hospitals, work that has been done in cancer care and changes that have happened in construction.  Almost every European country is either a member or an associate member of CERN or has a co-operation agreement with the body, except Ireland.<\/p> <p>We pride ourselves on our multilateralism.  Where we see an organisation like CERN facilitating co-operation and collaboration among the world's top scientists, we should be at its heart.  These scientists are addressing challenges that we all face, including Ireland.  Approximately 16,000 scientists from more than 110 countries worldwide have been involved in some of these projects.  Yet, Ireland's official policy is that members of our research community are not actively encouraged to take part because we are not a member of CERN.  An equivalent Government policy, and the equivalent of what we are saying to our researchers, would be if we were to tell our actors that they could not get involved in productions in Hollywood.  Another example, and the Minister of State will appreciate this, would be if we were to tell GAA players that they could not play in Croke Park.  By excluding Ireland and the members of our research community from CERN, we are not allowing them to perform on the international stage.<\/p> <p>All of us, including the Minister of State, are aware that we have top-class, global-level researchers in our universities, higher education institutions, HEIs, and research institutes nationwide who are engaged in some of the work CERN is involved in.  This includes artificial intelligence, quantum computing and engineering, communications and nanotechnology, etc.  We have top-class researchers in all these areas.  The Government under its Innovation 2020 policy committed to examining membership.  The process of discussions on membership started in 2016.  In November 2019, the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation recommended that we join or at least commence the process of seeking associate membership of CERN.  I raised this issue here on 3 March 2022 as a Commencement matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  On that occasion, he seemed to indicate that the only concern was the cost and not the principle of joining CERN.<\/p> <p>I will use an example to illustrate this point.  One recommendation in the Government's Innovation 2020 strategy was that Ireland would join several other organisations, including the European Southern Observatory, ESO, the European Life-science Infrastructure for Biological Information, ELIXIR, and the Low Frequency Array, LOFAR, network.  If we look at the outcome from our membership of the ESO, we will see that Irish HEIs and companies have already benefited enormously.  Partly, this is because the Government has not just joined the organisation but it has also set out a national space strategy for enterprise.  The impact of this is not necessarily concerned with what studying is going on in space, which has certainly been of benefit, but with how this affects our lives on the ground.  Therefore, I am not just asking that we join CERN; I also believe we should have a national strategy for CERN which ensures that we can avail of the benefits of membership and that our researchers can be actively involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#E00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this issue.

I also acknowledge the presence of our guests in the Public Gallery from the research community.<\/p> <p>Under the National Development Plan 2018-2027, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government outlined its intention to review Ireland's membership of CERN.  The Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 to initiate discussions with several international research organisations.  Four organisations were identified - CERN, the ESO, ELIXIR and LOFAR - and securing membership of three of these organisations has now been completed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Niall Collins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These organisations were identified based on a 2015 study that reviewed the costs and benefits of Ireland&rsquo;s existing and potential international research organisation memberships.  Impact 2030, the national strategy for research and innovation, undertakes a further review and optimises Ireland&rsquo;s membership of international research organisations to ensure that our engagement reflects our existing and emerging strategic priorities.<\/p><p>This follows on from the Oireachtas report, The Case for Irish Membership of CERN, published in November 2019.  It made three recommendations regarding Ireland&rsquo;s potential membership of CERN.  First, that negotiations start with CERN immediately with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member as soon as possible.  Second, that after three years as an associate member of CERN, the Department will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s associate membership of CERN and assess whether there is a case to be made for moving towards full membership.  Third, that efforts be made to fund the annual fee for associate membership of CERN from within the business, enterprise and innovation Vote.<\/p><p>The committee found that membership would generate opportunities not only for Irish enterprise, but also for its research community.  It noted that membership would bring opportunities for Irish researchers to participate in CERN&rsquo;s scientific programmes, working at the frontiers of scientific knowledge and using state-of-the-art technology and engineering.  Membership would have other benefits, the committee stated.  It would also enable researchers and companies in Ireland to collaborate with the best researchers and leading companies across Europe in the development of world-leading technology.  Membership would provide new opportunities for Irish researchers to win funding from the EU framework programme, Horizon Europe, through their participation in CERN.  Irish citizens would also be eligible for staff positions and fellowships at CERN.  The opportunity of a scientific breakthrough and technological advances are significant benefits to CERN membership that do not necessarily give a quantifiable return.  However, the committee also noted some concerns with the potential return for Ireland associated with the high cost of full membership.  The report therefore considers that associate membership may be a better option.  Associate membership would allow Ireland to have a reduced contribution.  However, it would also limit the available return and Ireland would not have a say in major decisions taken by CERN.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the report, Irish officials have been in regular contact with CERN.  Following the establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, active engagement with CERN has continued regarding the membership options for Ireland, the application process and the associated costs.  While Ireland has made considerable progress in its participation in international organisations in recent years, it is acknowledged that membership of CERN would be the next step in consolidating that progress.<\/p><p>Current agreed estimates with CERN show that associate membership will cost &euro;1.52 million per annum, subject to indexation, for a period of between three and five years.  It should be noted that based on current indications received from CERN, the eventual cost if Ireland were to pursue full membership, at 2022 prices, would be circa &euro;15.2 million annually and a one-off special contribution of about &euro;19.1 million due on the same day a country becomes a full member.  While the benefits of CERN membership are recognised as significant, the cost is also significant and must be addressed in the context of other Departmental and national investment priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#E00300","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I am a little disappointed because we do not seem to be making much progress.

I have raised this issue here previously.  On 10 November 2021, I asked the Minister to make a statement on the incineration of baby organs in Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, and asked what changes he proposed to bring forward.<\/p> <p>The backdrop to this is a sad case in which the organs of 18 children in the maternity hospital in Cork were incinerated without the knowledge or licence of their parents.  The parents were horrified that this happened.  It was the subject of an \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" report afterwards.  These poor kids were lost and their organs, which were kept to understand what happened, were subsequently destroyed by incineration in Antwerp, Belgium.<\/p> <p>We have been talking about bringing forward legislation to make sure that this could never again happen.  As a matter of principle, we should have legislation to ensure this kind of issue can be dealt with so we do not have a scenario in which parents are now protesting again and looking for information as to when this legislation might be brought forward.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, took my previous Commencement matter on this issue and gave me a commitment that the work of the Parliamentary Counsel was progressing and that the Bill would be published by the end of 2021.  2021 has come and gone and there is no legislation that I can see.  The Bill started its progress through the Oireachtas in 2019.  It was proposed in May 2019.  The damning issue here is that the Bill brings forward recommendations from a report published in early 2006 by the then Minister, Mary Harney.  We have been fighting since 2006 to bring this legislation all the way through the Oireachtas so that parents in this unbelievable scenario will have due responsibility and due rights when it comes to these organs that are being kept for medical research and an understanding of what happens.<\/p> <p>This is a traumatic moment for people.  They have been promised legislation continuously but it has not been brought forward.  This is the safeguard and the safety net they require at all times so they can make sure that the incident we have seen in Cork, which has also happened in other jurisdictions, will never again happen.<\/p> <p>I spoke about baby Hope Kelleher when I raised this issue previously.  Her parents contacted me from Australia about the issue.  Her organs were destroyed.  The parents had hoped her organs could be buried in a family plot.  Her organs were never brought back to them.  We need a timeline brought forward to ensure this can never happen again.  The families affected have heard promises, promises, promises.  The human tissue Bill has gone around these Houses since long before I came here.  I want a timeline as to when the Bill will be published so we can get this legislation on the Statute Book and offer due protection in order that what happened in Cork in 2020 can never again happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#G00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for bringing this important Commencement matter to the floor of the Seanad.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As committed to in the programme for Government, the enactment of the human tissue (transplantation, post-mortem, anatomical examination and public display) Bill remains a priority for the Government.  It is complex legislation that will include provisions on organ donation, transplantation, hospital post mortem practice and procedures, anatomical examination and public display of bodies after death.  In particular, the Bill seeks to further embed in legislation the idea that consent is a defining principle across all of these sensitive matters.<\/p><p>A key priority for the Government in bringing forward the Bill is to increase organ donation and transplantation rates and to make organ donations the norm in Ireland in situations where the opportunity arises.  The human tissue Bill will help to achieve this through the introduction of a soft opt-out system of consent for organ donation under which consent will be deemed unless a person has registered a wish to not become an organ donor after death.  The Bill will also legislate for living organ donation and altruistic donation, both of which will help to increase the donor pool in Ireland.<\/p><p>Given the complexity of the Bill, a number of challenges have been encountered in drafting the legislation that have had to be resolved before publication is possible.  Among other things, officials have had to develop three separate regulatory frameworks and amend the extant EU directives of 2006 and 2012 accordingly.  This has necessitated intensive engagement between the Department of Health and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Medical Council.  Department of Health officials have also undertaken an intensive round of engagement with stakeholders engaged in organ donation and transplantation over recent months to ensure the legislation meets the needs of this very important community.<\/p><p>As Senator Lombard is aware, as well as providing a legislative basis for organ donation and transplant the Bill will introduce a regulatory regime for the conduct of post mortems in hospital settings.  Under the general scheme of the Bill provisions were to be restricted solely to hospital post mortem activities.  However, in light of recent events a review is being undertaken to see whether an expansion of provisions to encompass certain aspects of coronial post mortem activities might be possible.  Intensive engagement is ongoing between officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Justice with the Attorney General and his officials to find a resolution to this issue.  Any solution found will be complementary to the recommendations of the recent HSE internal audit report on compliance by hospitals with the HSE standards and recommended practices for post mortem examination services and the work of the post mortem examination services group that is working on updating guidelines for post mortem practice.  Department of Health officials continue to work on finalising the legislation and drafting the Bill and it is at an advanced stage.  Government approval for publication of the human tissue Bill will be sought as soon as possible and is expected this Oireachtas term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#G00400","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group I extend our deepest sympathies to the families, those who have lost loved ones and to the entire community.  I strongly commend the fantastic work done by the emergency services who were on the scene dealing with what was an unthinkable tragedy.  The scale of it is phenomenal.  I also commend those working in the hospital.  They had to step up their emergency response.  The scale of what they had to deal with in a short space of time was such that if it had to be planned for it would be difficult even to plan.  They did everything they could.<\/p> <p>I commend those working on the ground now providing meals because the community has lost its only shop.  I commend the Government for using the existing humanitarian scheme that would normally be put in place for flood disasters to try and assist families out of direct financial assistance in the weeks and months ahead.  It is an unthinkable tragedy.<\/p> <p>It is important while we will be discussing the tragedy, and it will be top of the news agenda for the next number of weeks, that we do not forget those families and those communities beyond that point and that we continuously keep an eye on it because the loss and the impact of that tragedy will be felt far into the future.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.  It was lovely to see at the commemorative service the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Leader of the Opposition on the ground with the communities so soon after what had happened.  It shows the immense solidarity and support that we have for those communities and that the entire country has been impacted and affected by what happened there.<\/p> <p>I will raise another matter which is the energy costs around retrofitting.  The deep retrofit scheme was announced earlier this year.  It would be timely to have a debate in this House with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on how that is working because one of the things we could do to assist people with their energy costs is to try to help people to cut energy waste and to make their homes more efficient.<\/p> <p>I have concerns around the way the retrofit scheme has been set up.  In order to access the deep retrofit grant it is only necessary to pay the balance because a point of contact will do all the works and only charges the balance as the grant is claimed by that company.  However, to access the grant on a piecemeal basis, perhaps having the windows done first and then insulation separately to reduce expenditure, all the cost must be paid upfront and the grant is claimed back afterwards.  This seems to make it far easier for those who can afford to spend the big money on a full deep retrofit and not as easy for people trying to do it bit by bit until they get their list of works done.  We need to look at that because it has become more expensive now that the cost of materials and labour has gone through the roof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#O00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I express our sympathies regarding the ten people who lost their lives in County Donegal.

She is doing a PhD in Maynooth on disability and the impact of disability services in EU accession states.  She is also on the expert panel of the Organisation for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which is part of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  I am on the expert panel as well and it met for the first time in Poland last week.  What struck me from my engagement was the serious challenges that people with disabilities are facing in Ukraine.  We saw the bombing of Kyiv in the past 48 hours.  Let us imagine being a wheelchair user or someone who is blind and the air raid sirens go off.  In terms of reaching a shelter or somewhere else that was safe, they would be compromised even before anyone else was.<\/p> <p>What concerns me most is the fact that, of the 16 key aid agencies that are rightly getting billions of euro in funding from all over the world, only two have targeted programmes for people with disabilities in Ukraine.  That is not good enough.  As a country, we need to ensure that all of the key agencies, including the Red Cross, have dedicated programmes for providing financial support on the ground to Ukrainian organisations for persons with disabilities, which are struggling to support people.  The horrendous difficulties that persons with disabilities face in a war have regularly been discussed in the Houses.<\/p> <p>Some of the work that the panel I am a member of is doing involves examining the impact of emergency responses, particularly as they affect people with disabilities.

Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones - their families and friends - as well as the emergency services, both North and South, the community of Creeslough, the people of Donegal more widely and the county's diaspora.<\/p> <p>The colours green and gold are synonymous with Donegal in good times and in sad times.  They are, after all, the county colours.  Thinking of Creeslough in recent days, I have thought of a beautiful landscape of mountains, bogs, forests, lakes, rivers, seas and shores and, above all, of its people.

I think we were all deeply impacted by the tragic events at the weekend but also very proud of the response by the local community to what must have been a devastating and unimaginable scene to come upon.  Like Senator Boyhan, I thank, in particular, the first responders whether that was of the blue-light variety or, indeed, those in the Civil Defence in the local areas who stepped into an bhearna bhaoil so into a very dangerous and volatile situation to help in the effort in Creeslough.  It says a lot about the community that people were prepared to help in such a fashion.<\/p> <p>Support is being shown around the world, as the Leader knows, whether that is monetary support or, indeed, expressions of sympathy and that is important at a time like this.  It is so raw in the immediate aftermath for the community.  Equally, I hope, and I am confident, that through that pain and suffering these expressions of sympathy will penetrate and reach the families and the community, and give them some degree of succour.  I agree with the Deputy Leader and thought that it was important for political symbolism to have the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Leader of the Opposition on the ground so quickly.  That shows just how deeply this tragedy has impacted people right across Ireland.<\/p> <p>I do not think that I can build on the very eloquent contribution made by Senator Boyhan other than to say that County Donegal is a beautiful place.  It is beautiful because of its epic scenery and landscape.  Creeslough is a part of County Donegal that, like many, I know very well.  Its greatest asset, strength and beauty manifests in its people.  It is manifest in the people of County Donegal.  These are a people who have suffered tremendously over generations but a people who have always been resolute, united, confident, creative and talented.  That was represented in the loss of the ten people who died.  There was no better a representation of the best of County Donegal than those people themselves.<\/p> <p>Again, I extend our sympathies to the people there at this devastating time.  All of our thoughts and hearts are with them over these raw days and, crucially, in the time to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#Q00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I join with colleagues in remembering those who lost their lives in Creeslough last Friday.

I wish our women's international soccer team the very best in Hampden Park tonight.  I have watched every match the women have played in their campaign this year and attended their match against Sweden here in Dublin.  They are a credit to this country.  These young women are bringing the women's game to the fore and showing young girls what it means to put on that international jersey.  They must be credited and thanked for everything they do and we send them our best wishes.<\/p><p>However, there is another side to this story I want to raise.  Many of these young women, unfortunately, must go to England to pursue their dream of a professional career.  Some in the squad are amateurs and are still playing here in the national leagues.  As my colleague Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said this morning, it is time we looked at creating a contract through Government intervention and with the FAI so we can grow the game at local level and increase that representation at national level.  I congratulate the IRFU on recently awarding 43 international contracts to its professionals and creating a professional atmosphere for women's rugby in this country.  It is time we grew such an atmosphere in soccer through whatever initiatives we can.  It is essential we support the women's international game.  Tonight we hope to have a good news story where a women's international team qualify for the World Cup for the very first time.<\/p><p>Tomorrow during Private Members' business in the D&aacute;il my party colleagues will bring forward a motion to provide a mechanism for community workers to get a pay increase they have not received in 14 years.  We are all aware of the great work done by section 39 workers, community employment, CE, supervisors and all such workers in our communities.  It is true to say that without many of them, many of our community facilities simply would not function and many families would not have the supports they and their loved ones so badly need.  I have spoken to many people in the sector over recent days.  They consider themselves the forgotten workers of this country despite the work they do being essential.  I hope the Government will accept this motion tomorrow and that in the future we can discuss once again the great work done by all those people in all those organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#Q00400","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I would also like to be associated with the remarks expressing our sympathies to the people in Creeslough and the wider Donegal community.

However, we should look at making greater use of retired members of the force and possibly encourage them to take part in the Garda Reserve by doing a number of hours in Garda station offices and so on.  This is something Councillor Mannix Flynn on Dublin City Council has raised on a number of occasions.  We are missing out on the valuable resources many of our retired garda&iacute; could give to the reserve.<\/p> <p>Like Senator Wall, I wish our women's soccer team well.  I am glad the FIFA Women's World Cup will be held in locations that respect human rights.  There is a major concern about the fact the men's World Cup will take place in Qatar where there continues to be evidence of abuse of migrant workers, including wage abuse.  There is evidence more than 50 labourers died there in 2021.  Homophobia is rife in a country where it remains on the statute book that if you engage in same-sex sexual activity, the penalties could include death.  As for the treatment of women there, a woman in Qatar must obtain the permission of her male guardian if she wishes to marry, work in certain jobs, travel or study abroad or indeed be the primary carer for a child, even in the case of divorce.  I express the concern of this House about the FIFA World Cup or any international sporting event being held in a country where human rights are abused.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would hope that every Member of this House, if they are travelling to any of these countries, would raise human rights abuses and certainly should not praise the regime in these countries or try to minimise the deaths of migrant labourers.

It was a shameful decision.  The Amnesty International report for 2021 and research completed over the past decade confirm it was a terrible decision.  Since the award was made to Qatar over ten years ago, over 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar.  They have died building the stadiums, airport, roads, public transport system and hotels, and even a new city, which will host the World Cup final.  We are aware that migrant workers in many countries are the lowest paid and have no workers' rights.  It is particularly the case in Qatar.  The construction industry has failed to protect the 2-million-strong migrant workforce.  When we see Qatar's grim death toll revealed in the official data, it is really striking that the causes of death include falls from a height and asphyxiation due to hanging.  Deaths of undetermined cause are also listed.  The most common cause of death listed, natural death, was attributed to acute heart or respiratory failure because of the conditions in which the migrants were working.  That is before we get on to all the other human rights violations.  Therefore, it is deeply concerning to see that a Member of this House went on an all-expenses-paid trip to Qatar to try to whitewash what has happened there.  The country should never have got the World Cup.  I hope that if people watch it, they will remember the workers who died to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#S00400","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I wish to raise an issue that is quite serious and has been a scourge in recent years, namely class A drugs.

A delegation came to see me at one of my clinics in Kinsale yesterday about the Cork-to-Kinsale route.  It is a significant one used by tourists every day.  The starting point for that route has been changed, however.  Instead of starting at the bus station at Parnell Place, it is commencing from Clontarf Street.  This is about the process in this regard.  Things change, but the process is the key thing.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, comes in and it just makes changes.  There is no consultation and no mechanism whereby members of the community are asked what they think.  There is no interaction whatsoever.  The NTA is the funder and, therefore, it has the ultimate power.<\/p> <p>We have now had a bus stop moved, and no bus shelter provided, to right beside an adult shop.  Residents of a certain age are trying to get off the bus there every hour of every day.  The queues are beyond belief because the bus route is tied in with the service to the airport.  Instead of making it to Kinsale in 45 minutes, therefore, it now takes just over an hour.  When we look at how we are governing our State and at who has the power of governance, the power the NTA has now is beyond belief.

In other words, it is either the NTA&rsquo;s idea or nothing.  That is not governance or a democracy.  That is not what the people want.  <\/p><p>We need to have the Minister come in so we can ask who actually controls and runs the NTA.  Who has the power of control and audit over the NTA?

It puts everything else into perspective.  Our thoughts and prayers go to all of the families involved who are bereaved.<\/p> <p>The Leader is very familiar with the school meals programme and the hot school meals that are provided.  Indeed, in her former life, she was involved in that programme, which has gone from success to success, from about 30 schools to about 300 and some &euro;65 million spent.  <\/p> <p>We met recently with the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board regarding the school meals programme.  It too believes it a huge success, but it is concerned that there has been no review of the Department of Social Protection's maximum rate of payment in more than a decade regarding the costs of providing those school meals.  <\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, initiated a review into the programme.  Perhaps that review has not concluded or perhaps they are looking at the rates.  I think they are aware of the extra costs currently facing suppliers.  Unfortunately, we now have a situation whereby there is nobody tendering for the provision of school meals in certain areas.  I spoke to a company that had tendered previously that said that it has not tendered for this year because of the increase in costs.  The maximum rate of pay, for example, for a breakfast or snack is 60 cent for two items; for lunch, it is &euro;1.40 for one substantial item, one small item and a drink; dinner is &euro;1.90 for a hot meal and drink; and a hot meal club is &euro;2.90.  It gives examples of the food that is to be provided as well.  <\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Social Protection to see whether there will be a review of those rates.  It is a hugely successful and important programme.  We know the importance of having nutritious food and ensuring school children have breakfast, lunch and sometimes a hot meal.

It makes no sense to have the funding there if the cost per head is not sufficient for people to be able to apply for the tender.  I will certainly contact the Minister today and ask her what the story is with the review.

In addition, it transposes most of another EU directive, the better enforcement and modernisation directive.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Dara Calleary:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Bill has received significant consideration due to its complexity.  I want particularly to acknowledge the work of former Ministers, Deputies Richard Bruton and Robert Troy, during their time in this Department in developing and progressing this legislation.  The Bill has passed pre-legislative scrutiny and has come through the D&aacute;il.  I acknowledge the cross-party support for its provisions.  This speaks to its importance.  That is why I am particularly pleased to introduce the Bill to Seanad &Eacute;ireann today.  <\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to bring about several positive changes for consumers, including stronger consumer rights, protections and remedies across a number of key areas.  For instance, it gives people stronger consumer rights when it comes to how problems with goods or services are resolved.  Instead of just exchange, refund or repair, customers will also be entitled to agree a price reduction on faulty goods and flawed services.  They will also be entitled to withhold payment for goods or services that have been partially paid for if they are not satisfied with the quality of the item or service received.  Critically the Bill stipulates that any form of redress must be free of charge and must be carried out as soon as possible. <\/p><p>The Bill brings together in one statute provisions that are currently contained in diverse pieces of law and some that have never been regulated before.  In existing legislation consumers have no rights to remedies when services are not provided as expected and agreed, for example, legal services or building services.  The Consumer Rights Bill closes that gap.  It also includes new protections for consumers in regard to digital content such as audio and video files, computer games and digital services such as streaming services, cloud computing and social media.  These new digital rights include the right to a full refund, exchange or repair when a good or service is not as described nor fit for purpose.<\/p><p>Consumers will be entitled to any upgrades to the product or service that is needed to ensure that it continues to work as expected and agreed free of charge.  The Bill contains a new blacklist of contract terms and conditions that are automatically deemed to be unfair and which should not be included in any consumer contract, for example, where the agreement is only legally binding for the consumer and not the trader.  Businesses will be required to set out clearly a description of the goods or services being provided, the total price and cost of delivery before entering a contract with a consumer.<\/p><p>Furthermore the Bill gives extra enforcement powers to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, which is the body responsible for enforcing consumer law in Ireland.  These new powers mean that when traders engage in misleading and aggressive commercial practices like posting fake reviews or where they do not provide the remedies or reimbursements that consumers are entitled to, the CCPC can take action such as issuing compliance notices or applying to the Circuit Court or the High Court for a declaration or injunction.  It will also provide enforcement powers to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in regard to electronic communication services and premium rate services, and to the Central Bank with regard to financial services. <\/p><p>The date given by the European Commission for transposing these directives was July 2021 for the sale of goods directive and the digital content directive, and November 2021 for the better enforcement and modernisation directive.  Unfortunately we, along with several other member states, did not meet these deadlines.  As seen and as noted through earlier debates this Bill is a complex and highly technical piece of legislation which required significant consideration and redrafting.  The focus has been to make sure that we get it right even if that meant taking a little more time.  I am confident therefore that the Bill presented today is robust, well-considered and fit for purpose.  <\/p><p>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  This Bill contains 14 Parts and six Schedules.  It is important to point out at this juncture that with very limited exceptions Parts 2, 3 and 5 transpose maximum harmonisation directives which give little or no discretion as to their implementation. <\/p><p>Part 1 deals with matters common to legislation.  It also contains generally applying provisions relating to the making of contracts, preventing traders from attempting to restrict the rights of the consumer and the jurisdiction of the court to order remedies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Dara Calleary:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Part 2 focuses on the rights of consumers under sales contracts and on the remedies available to consumers where goods do not conform to those contracts.  It gives effect to the 2019 sale of goods directive and incorporates the provisions applying to consumer contracts under the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  It also deals with commercial guarantees.<\/p><p>Part 3 gives effect to the digital content directive on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services.  Its provisions set out the rights that apply under such contracts and the remedies that apply for the infringement of those rights.<\/p><p>Part 4 will replace the provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 that relate to service contracts.  It expands the rights of consumers in respect of such contracts and establishes a scheme of remedies that will apply where a service does not conform to those rights.<\/p><p>Part 5 re-enacts, with substantial amendment, the provisions on consumer information and cancellation rights contained in the consumer rights directive.  In addition, it repeats rights in the directive relating to payment fees, additional payments, charges for calls to consumer helplines and inertia selling.<\/p><p>Part 6 makes a number of important changes to the provisions of the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995, which transposed the unfair terms in consumer contracts directive.  It also gives effect to the new penalty provisions inserted in the directive by the better enforcement and modernisation directive.<\/p><p>Part 7 sets out the enforcement powers and penalties under the Bill.  The CCPC will have enforcement responsibilities for consumer contracts under all Parts of this legislation.  The Central Bank will continue to have an enforcement function under Part 7 and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, will have an enforcement function under Parts 5 to 7.<\/p><p>Part 8 contains the various amendments to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 that are required to ensure that the protections and remedies available to consumers in respect of the purchase of goods will be available irrespective of whether the consumer pays the price in a one-off payment or by way of instalment or other type of deferred payment.<\/p><p>Part 9 contains the various amendments to the Consumer Protection Act 2007 that are required to transpose amendments to the unfair commercial practices directive made by the better enforcement and modernisation direction.  These amendments will extend and enhance the enforcement measures available to the CCPC.<\/p><p>Parts 10 to 14 provide for a number of amendments to other enactments, such as the Central Bank Act 1942, the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 and the Companies Act 2014.<\/p><p>Schedule 1 sets out repeals and revocations.  Schedule 2 sets out the information to be provided by the trader prior to the conclusion of an on-premises contract.  Schedule 3 sets out the information to be provided by the trader prior to the conclusion of an off-premises contract or distance contract.  Schedule 4 provides the information concerning the exercise of the right to cancel and includes the model cancellation form.  Schedule 5 deals with contract terms that are presumed unfair.  Schedule 6 sets out the amendments to Acts and statutory instruments.<\/p><p>A comprehensive consolidated consumer rights Act will provide a legislative framework that is more appropriate to present-day conditions and requirements, is simpler to understand and navigate, creates clearer rules for businesses and strengthens consumer rights.  Therefore, this legislation is good news for consumers.  It is equally good news for businesses because it recognises the behaviour of responsible traders and puts them on a legislative footing.  It also ensures that regulators like the CCPC and ComReg have the powers necessary to sanction businesses that do not uphold the standards that this legislation will demand.<\/p><p>I thank everyone who has made an input to the Bill to date.  I thank the officials in my Department for the considerable work that has gone into the Bill.  I look forward to further input during this debate and I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#CC00500","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I omitted to welcome the Minister of State's officials to the House.

It consolidates and updates existing legislation on the sale of goods and supply of services in order to ensure that our legislation is fit for purpose in the modern digital age.

Consumers will be entitled free of charge to any upgrades to the product or service that are needed to ensure the goods continue to work as expected.<\/p><p>We must ensure we have a fair and effective market that works for both businesses and consumers.  This Bill contributes to that aim by strengthening protections for consumers while also creating clear rules for our businesses.  The Bill also includes a new blacklist of contract terms and conditions that are automatically deemed to be unfair and which should not be included in any consumer contract.  This includes instances where the agreement is only legally binding for the consumer and not for the trader, or where the trader can decide to change the terms and conditions of the contract without informing the consumer in advance.  Businesses will be required to set out clearly a description of the goods or services being provided and the total price and costs of delivery before entering into a contract with the consumer.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Bill gives extra enforcement powers to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the body responsible for enforcing consumer law in this country.  These new powers mean that where traders engage in misleading and aggressive commercial practices, such as posting fake reviews, or where they do not provide the remedies or reimbursement to which consumers are entitled, the CCPC can take action such as issuing compliance notices or applying to the Circuit Court or High Court for a declaration or an injunction.  It will also provide enforcement powers to ComReg with regard to electronic communication services and premium rate services and to the Central Bank with regard to financial services.<\/p><p>The crackdown on fake reviews the Bill will provide for is most welcome because it is needed.  Senators will be aware of how manipulative such fake reviews can be to consumers, particularly now in this digital age where, for far too long, a very small minority of companies have been able to get away with fake reviews that make outrageous claims and promises that wildly mislead consumers.  Similarly, Senators will be aware of cases over the years of businesses leaving reviews on the products of their competitors.  Not alone is this unjust on the vast majority of businesses that act in the right way, but it also serves to undermine confidence in reviews in the wider domain, which again affects consumers negatively.  The Bill provides a mechanism whereby companies that engage in misleading and aggressive commercial practices such as fake reviews can be subject to fines imposed by the courts following enforcement action taken by the CCPC.  This step is overdue and much needed.  It is welcomed by the vast majority of businesses whose behaviour is above board.<\/p><p>It should also be acknowledged that the response of stakeholders to this legislation has been very positive, with the Bill being warmly welcomed by both the CCPC and Digital Business Ireland.  It is the most significant reform of consumer law in decades.  It will provide the enhanced protections necessary in this digital age and it should be welcomed by all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#EE00300","speaker":"1646","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>We always welcome visitors to the Gallery.

As the Minister of State noted, this is a good day for consumer rights with regard to goods and services, and also digital services.  I hope today is the day our consumer rights catch up with the digital transformation.  This Bill has been a long time in the making.  As the Minister of State said, the former Minister, Deputy  Bruton, the former Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and now the Minister of State himself have all worked on this legislation, which is the most significant Bill in this area in four decades.<\/p> <p>The Bill substantially reforms and consolidates existing consumer protection legislation.  It is important that it does this for the consumer but it also brings clarity to businesses by bringing all of the existing provisions under a single Act, while at the same introducing new and enhanced consumer protection measures.  In 2011, the sales law review group concluded that the legislative framework for consumer contract rights, in addition to the EU directives in this area, was becoming very complex and contradictory in parts.  This Bill will bring together the different legislation and also transpose the necessary EU directives, taking into consideration various aspects of consumer contracts.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State outlined what the Bill proposes to do.  Of most significance is that it provides a comprehensive and straightforward legal framework to regulate the main types of consumer contract, modernising existing consumer law and the EU directives.  The Bill enhances the powers of the CCPC, which is very important.  It extends enforcement powers to ComReg in relation to electronic communications and premium rate services and to the Central Bank in relation to financial services.  It amends provisions off the Consumer Credit Act 1995 regarding hire purchase agreements and consumer hire agreements so that they mirror the rights provided for under sales contracts.  Given the proliferation of various aspects of consumer contracts, I can only imagine what a complex process this has been.<\/p> <p>Of the three EU directives from 2019, one covers contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services, another covers contracts for the sale of goods and the third is for the better enforcement and modernisation of EU consumer protection rules.  Three of four parts of the third directive are included, dealing with unfair terms and consumer contracts, unfair commercial practices and consumer rights.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State set out the benefits of this legislation, as wide and far-reaching as it is, in a concise and succinct way.  It protects consumers with regard to the quantity, quality, durability and any other feature of the goods that were bought for the purpose for which they were bought.  This means that the contracts must be honoured or reimbursement must be provided within 14 days.  New protections for consumers are included for digital content and services.<\/p> <p>As my colleague, Senator Crowe, pointed out, reviews and fake reviews are covered by the Bill.  Consumer contracts for the supply of digital services have not previously been the subject of specific statutory regulation.  Service contracts are also included and are obviously a very important part of consumer activity now.  Consumer information and cancellation rights are also addressed, as are unfair terms in consumer contracts, including through a new blacklist of contract terms and conditions that are regarded as unfair and should not be included in consumer contracts.  Unfair consumer practices are also covered, with additional protections provided against misleading and aggressive commercial practices and enforcement powers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State has outlined various aspects of the Bill.

I am glad to see the Minister of State in that seat because I am hopeful he will be open to the proposal I will make and the amendments I intend to bring on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>The Bill transposes EU legislation into Irish law and, indeed, the State has missed the deadlines of July and November of last year given by the Commission for transposing the EU directives.  I appreciate it has been a huge and complex piece of work and I acknowledge the hard work of officials in putting such a large Bill together.  A major overhaul of consumer rights legislation in the State is long overdue, especially as consumers who buy goods in shops do not have the same rights as those who buy goods online.  With the vast array of digital services available, legislation must keep up with the fast-paced and ever-changing online world.<\/p> <p>The Bill seeks to be consumer friendly, which is most welcome.  It will amend the law where there are unfair terms and contracts between consumers and traders, particularly for online consumers.  If a person buys a product from a shop in town and discovers there is something wrong with it, it is much easier to return it and get a refund.  However, when purchasing goods or digital services online, the terms and conditions very often make it a lot more casta, more difficult.<\/p> <p>The Bill makes it clear that any form of redress must be free of charge and carried out as soon as possible.  This is significant because the time it can take for consumers to get redress or a refund on something they have purchased online can be extremely frustrating.  It usually ends up being so frustrating that at some point they give up and call it a day, and are left out of pocket as a result.  I would say nearly every Member in this Chamber has had that kind of experience, where it is not worth any more of your time battling these companies because they are driving you mad.  Therefore, this part of the Bill is most welcome.  As has been said, it covers digital content and services such as streaming, downloads and cloud products.  New digital rights will include the right to a full refund, exchange or repair when a good or service is not as described or not fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>Part 3 on remedies in sales contracts sets down a short-term right to terminate sales contracts; a right to repair or replacement of goods; a right to a proportionate reduction in the price or final termination of sales contract; reimbursement within 14 days by the trader using the same means of payment and without the imposition of any fees; and a general right to withhold payment where the trader fails to deliver goods in conformity with the sales contract.  All these new rights and improvements in consumer law will only be effective and useful if there is a way to monitor and enforce them.  The Bill gives more power to the CCPC and with those additional powers more resources will be required, which I hope will be provided.  It would be a shame for many of the good provisions in the Bill to go through but in the end not have any teeth.<\/p> <p>Rud at&aacute; in easnamh go hioml&aacute;n sa Bhille n&aacute; cosaint&iacute; do thomhalt&oacute;ir&iacute; ar mian leo feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.

I have not seen him since his appointment to his current role.  I wish him the best in that regard.<\/p> <p>I join with all Senators across the Chamber in welcoming the Bill.  Online commerce has been with us for about a decade and a half and it has been very much the wild west with regard to consumer protection.  Therefore, we welcome the Bill as an important and comprehensive step in protecting consumers in terms of online transactions.  The merits of the Bill have been well articulated so I will cut to questions and concerns I have on its scope.<\/p> <p>The first issue is the resourcing of the CCPC and ComReg in the enforcement of the new legislation that will be in place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While we have, by and large, well-established custom and practice for the bricks and mortar retail sector, there is much greater variability online and that has been proved by the queries that come into our offices.  There will be a much greater requirement to have strong resources and for the CCPC to be well resourced to deal with the volume of queries that will be forthcoming, especially in the early years after the Bill is enacted.  I would like to hear from the Minister of State on that.<br\/><br\/>The second element is where the online transactions take place.  As I understand it, this is a Bill transposing an EU directive and which applies to commerce and online transactions taking place in this country.  However, there is a fundamental question surrounding transactions on websites that purport to be located within this State but are actually located outside it.During the Second Stage debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Sherlock cited figures stating there are 309,953 <i>.ie<\/i>domains in existence.  He added that &quot;Only 278,042 of those are based in the Republic of Ireland, while 4,532 are based in Northern Ireland&quot;.  Then there are 31,911 <i>.ie <\/i>domains located elsewhere.  The question about the 36,000 domains located outside the Republic of Ireland is where the consumer rights of those who purchase good and services from them stand.  I have had a number of people come to me and say they thought they had the security, safety and assurance of buying on a <i>.ie <\/i>domain only to then be hit with UK customs charges, goods going missing or fraud taking place.  Those people have no recourse and it is not apparent they will have any under this Bill.  If that is the case, then there is a large part of the jigsaw missing in the strengthening of online consumer protections.<br\/><br\/>I note the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Troy, responded in the D&aacute;il that this was a matter for the Minister with responsibility for communications as it concerned regulation of <i>.ie <\/i>domains, but frankly, that is not good enough.  We cannot have a Department talking about consumer protections and then pushing the regulation of the domains where the commercial activity takes place to another Department.  We need to have joined-up thinking here.  We are looking for a response from Government.  If it cannot be from one Department, then it needs to come from two of them but we need a Government response on where the <i>.ie <\/i>domains stand.  It is, as I said, the missing piece of the jigsaw where consumer protection is concerned, especially as people think they are buying within the Twenty-six Counties and sometimes they are not, unbeknownst to them.<br\/><br\/>My last point is on redress.  There is now a strong range of redress options available in the event a good or service purchased online is not what it purported to be, those options being the right to refund, repair and exchange.  However, there is an issue with the options provided to a consumer and especially the expectations about how long an electronic product or service should be expected to last.  My colleagues Deputies Sherlock and Kelly submitted an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to ensure consumers can rely on the products they buy to last a reasonable length of time so it is not just that you buy something and it falls apart and must be refunded or exchanged.  Especially now when we want to promote a circular economy and ensure we are not just ditching products because they are faulty from the minute they are purchased, that right to repair is exceptionally important, as is an understanding of how long a product should last.  I am not sure there is detail in the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il on that reasonable expectation about how long a product should last.<br\/><br\/>I would like to hear from the Minister of State on those issues.  Other than that we welcome the Bill and look forward to its passage through this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#GG00600","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in.  It is great to see we are looking at consumer rights and at strengthening them.  I heard the Minister of State's opening remarks and understand there have been delays and challenges around the fact it has been so complex and that this has been a key reason for the delays.<\/p> <p>It is crucial we are looking at consumer rights.  A section I wish to highlight is that it is going to be possible to get a price reduction on faulty goods and flawed services.  When you are looking at something, you are looking at sale items and everything else, but when something is damaged and you are paying full price for it, it is going to be fantastic for consumers to be able to engage with the retailer on this, and the retailer has very clear guidance on this as well.<\/p> <p>It has probably been mentioned but the challenge we have is with the return of goods or items and how we are managing waste.  I am thinking of things like fast fashion and so on.  Is there anything in this Bill we can look at around that sort of circular economy?  Maybe it is outside the remit of this but when we are looking at repairing and at items that are faulty, instead of the exchange, refund and repair, are there other elements we could use to strengthen the options consumers have around the circular economy?<\/p> <p>Another aspect I want to highlight is digital content and streaming services.  The challenge we sometimes have is consumers are sometimes not aware of their rights.  We are looking at an ombudsman for consumers, but when it comes to this, will there be a communications campaign once this Bill come through?  Will there be a way for us to ensure consumers are aware we have these new rights?  It is great to have them, but when people do not know about them, it is a challenge.  Perhaps shops could have signage up that people can see when they are paying so they are aware of these new options.<\/p> <p>I apologise but the last point I wanted to raise has gone out of my head.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#HH00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l aon duine eile le labhairt ach an tAire St&aacute;it.

I am grateful for the general broad support for the purpose of the Bill as well as some of the constructive debate on the finer details and the acknowledgement of the work that has been put in by the Department officials.<\/p> <p>This legislation has the improvement of consumer protection at its heart and its enactment will be good overall for consumers and responsible traders alike, as Senator Crowe said.  I am encouraged that while there may be some minor disagreement on particular areas, there is full agreement regarding the overarching principles.  I will address a number of points which were raised throughout the debate.  It is very clear this legislation is predominantly about transposing maximum harmonisation measures arising from EU directives and so we have no discretion in relation to their implementation.  Other parts of the legislation are updating and consolidating consumer contract rights that are already in place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Dara Calleary:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On the points made by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, tuigim leasuithe an tSeanad&oacute;ra agus a thuairim maidir le daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus an g&aacute; chun cosaint a thabhairt do na daoine sin sa Bhille.

The Senators inquired about extra resources and powers for the CCPC.  Additional costs to facilitate the enhanced enforcement functions, and the communication of the new rights for consumers, have been factored into the budgetary and Estimates process.  The CCPC has received an increase in its annual budget of 5.8%, which equates to an additional &euro;1 million.  Under this Government, the CCPC has seen its Exchequer funding increase by 71% over the last two years.  I am confident that this will allow the CCPC to recruit additional staff to carry out its remit effectively under this legislation.  My officials are in regular contact with the CCPC about an information campaign on the new resources in this Bill for consumers.<br\/><br\/>On the interaction between the various regulators that will have a role to play, the CCPC, ComReg and the Central Bank will continue to regulate their own sectors.  These organisations already demonstrate strong collaboration in this space in the form of a memorandum of understanding and other agreements.<br\/><br\/>Senator Sherlock made a point about consumers purchasing from websites with a <i>.ie<\/i>domain.  I assure the Senator that there is a whole-of-government response.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is responsible for the registration of domains.  Businesses must meet a number of requirements before they can get an <i>.ie<\/i>registration, including a requirement to have offices in Ireland.  The CCPC communicates with consumers on how to protect themselves regarding domains.  We will contact the CCPC again following this debate to emphasise the communication element, particularly after the enactment of this Bill.  I know that my predecessor, Deputy Troy, took on board what was said.  I assure Senator Sherlock that my Department has looked at this matter with the other Department and the CCPC.  We will continue to pursue the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senators Sherlock and Dolan mentioned issues that concern the circular economy.  This Bill does not contain provisions that specifically relate to the circular economy beyond the opportunity, where feasible, for consumers to seek the repair of faulty goods.  However, work is ongoing in the European Commission to empower consumers to make more sustainable consumption decisions and move towards a clean and green circular economy.  This work involves proposals to nudge consumers and traders towards repair, as opposed to the replacement of faulty goods in the first instance.  It also includes a proposal to amend existing directives to enhance consumer protection against unfair commercial practices that prevent sustainable purchases.  An example of such practices is greenwashing, or the making of misleading environmental claims.  Another example, and this follows on from the remarks made by Senators Dolan and Sherlock, is the phenomenon of early obsolescence, which is the premature failure of goods.  We will continue to work with the Commission on that.<br\/><br\/>I thank everybody for their comments.  I believe this Bill will enhance and solidify consumer rights.  I thank all the Senators who participated in the debate this evening.  I look forward to working with the Seanad on Committee and Report Stages so that we can get this Bill enacted as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#HH00400","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1665495000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#JJ00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#JJ00400","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I am sharing time with Senator Mary Fitzpatrick.  Today, on International Day of the Girl Child, Fianna F&aacute;il tabled this motion out of great concern for what is currently happening in Iran to women and girls and also to express our outrage at the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested on 13 September for not wearing a hijab in full compliance with Iran&rsquo;s mandatory requirements for how women must dress. <\/p><p>Mahsa was arrested for not wearing a hijab and the authorities have claimed she died from natural causes - that she suffered a heart attack - which something her father does not believe nor do I, and I do not think anybody else does either.  Mahsa is another victim of Iran&rsquo;s continual repression and organised discrimination against women and the imposition of discriminatory dress codes that deprive women of bodily autonomy and the freedoms of opinion, expression and belief.<\/p><p>Since news of Mahsa&rsquo;s death emerged, Iranians have taken to the streets to protest her death in major cities across Iran to demand accountability for her death and to put an end to violence and discrimination against women in the country, particularly compulsory veiling for women.  Women, young girls and also men have taking to fighting for basic rights and equality for Iranian women, which is something that we all take for granted - the very basic freedoms that we all enjoy on a day-to-day daily basis.<\/p><p>Videos on social media show women and young girls protesting in the streets day and night.  Young teenage girls in their schools have been protesting for their right to freedom from the oppressive laws placed on them as women and girls of Iran.  Following the protests, prolonged Internet disruptions have been reported in Tehran, Kurdistan provinces and other parts of the country since 19 September.  This is the third widespread Internet shutdown recorded over the past 12 months in Iran.<\/p><p>Over the past four decades, Iranian women have continued to peacefully protest against the compulsory hijab rules and the violations of their fundamental human rights.  It has been reported that the morality police routinely subject women and girls to arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment for not complying with Iran&rsquo;s compulsory veiling laws.<\/p><p>Mahsa Amini is a victim of Iran&rsquo;s continual repression and organised discrimination.  Her family said that they were notified that she had been taken to hospital hours after her arrest.  She was transferred to an intensive care unit at Kasra Hospital.  According to Human Rights Activists News Agency, HRANA, an Iranian human rights organisation, Amini&rsquo;s family were told during her arrest that she would be released after a &ldquo;re-education session&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The news comes weeks after Iran&rsquo;s President, Ebrahim Raisi, ordered a crackdown on women&rsquo;s rights and called for stricter enforcement of the country&rsquo;s mandatory dress code, which has required all women to wear the hijab head covering since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.<\/p><p>According to Amnesty, Iranian security forces unlawfully killed at least 66 people, including children, and injured hundreds of others after firing live ammunition, metal pellets and tear gas at protesters, bystanders and worshippers during a violent crackdown after Friday prayers on 30 September in Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchestan provinces.  Since then, another 16 people were killed in separate incidents in Zahedan amid an ongoing clampdown on protests.  Evidence gathered from activists, victims&rsquo; families, eyewitness testimonies and images and videos of the protests suggest the real death toll is likely to be much higher.  Widely referred to by Iranians as &ldquo;bloody Friday&rdquo;, the onslaught on 30 September marked the deadliest day on record since protest started spreading across Iran nearly three weeks ago.  <\/p><p>For the third time since the unrest started, members of the medical community issued a statement demanding security forces show greater restraint, saying protesters were being taken out of ambulances and beaten up with batons.  The Iranian official press countered by publishing the names of 24 security officials they claimed had been killed by rioters since the protests started; however, no evidence has been supplied to support this.<\/p><p>Lawyers in Iran also hit back at a statement from the interior ministry that they would from now on hand out exemplary sentences to those convicted of rioting.  They said all cases had to be treated on an individual basis and it was the heavy-handedness of the legal process that had led to the troubles.<\/p><p>Amnesty International has documented an alarming escalation in the use of force and firearms since 21 September, when the country&rsquo;s top military body is said to have issued an order to commanders in all provinces instructing them to &quot;severely confront troublemakers and anti-revolutionaries&quot;.  In an attempt to absolve themselves of responsibility for the deaths I mentioned, the authorities in Iran have started to share false narratives, blaming the deaths on terrorist, rioters and separatists, whom they claim were acting for foreign governments.  Again, there is no evidence to support this.  <\/p><p>Propaganda videos broadcast on state media after 30 September have shown detainees whom authorities allege were involved in armed attacks against security forces with sacks over their heads.  One video shows a detainee being asked leading questions by a TV presenter and being forced to make self-incriminating statements without a lawyer present over his alleged involvements in shootings on 30 September.  Given the Iranian authorities&rsquo; well-documented pattern of producing and broadcasting coerced statements from detainees to cover up human rights violations, Amnesty International has expressed concern that such statements have been extracted under duress, which is a reasonable suggestion.<\/p><p>The authorities claimed that protesters committed acts of looting and arson of public property.  However, beyond a minority of protesters throwing some stones at the police station, there has been no evidence of any such aggression on the part of protesters.  It is quite clear that the Iranian authorities are using excessive and often lethal force against peaceful protesters.  The unjustifiable, hugely violent and disproportionate response of the Iranian authorities to Iranian citizens protesting against the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody should be of grave concern to anyone who believes in democracy, freedom of expression and basic human rights.<\/p><p>Along with Mahsa Amini&rsquo;s name, I want to put on the record the names of the other young women and girls who I believe have been murdered as a result of protesting for their freedom.  Hadis Najafi, a 20-year-old woman, was shot six times when security forces opened fire on her.  Ghazale Chelavi, a 32-year-old, was shot in the head after chanting &ldquo;We are all Mahsa Amini&rdquo;.  Hanane Kia, aged 23, was shot and killed by Iranian security forces during protest.  Mahsa Mogoi, aged 18, was shot and killed by Iranian security forces during a protest.  Nika Shakarami, aged 16, was killed after burning her headscarf in protest.  Sarina Esmailzadeh, aged 16, was beaten to death by Iranian security forces for protesting.  If people search Sarina&rsquo;s name on Twitter, they will find the most beautifully innocent video of her singing Hozier&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Take Me to Church&rdquo;, a song we all know very well.  It is a devastating loss of a very bright and vibrant young woman in the prime of her life &ndash; a life that she will never get to live.<\/p><p>As a party, Fianna F&aacute;il strongly condemns the use of violence against women and the denial of basic human rights and dignity when imposing compulsory hijab policies designated by state authorities.  We also deplore the persistent impunity with respect to human rights violations in Iran, including the frequent deaths of protesters who are protesting peacefully due to the alleged use of lethal force by security forces.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We call on the Iranian authorities to respect the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, peaceful assembly and association as a state that is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, and to say clearly that the use of force against non-violent protestors is unjustifiable and unacceptable.<\/p><p>Today, on what is International Day of the Girl Child, I pledge my solidarity and that of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues to the women and girls of Iran who are fighting for the basic human right of being able to choose what they want to wear, to no longer be policed by the so-called morality police, to be free to express themselves in any way they feel is right for them, to live their lives to the fullest and to enjoy every freedom in doing so.

That right must be ensured, protected and asserted in all circumstances.<\/p> <p>We are specifically calling on the Iranian authorities to abide strictly by the principles enshrined in the ICCPR, to which Iran is a party.  We want them to stop the violent crackdowns on protests immediately.  We want to ensure that Internet access and the free flow of modern communications are restored and guaranteed for every human being.  We want clarity on the number of deaths and arrests, we want the release of all non-violent protestors and we want to ensure that due process is provided to all detainees.<\/p> <p>We must ensure that the killing of Mahsa Amini is properly and fairly investigated and that any person who is proven to have had any hand, act or part in causing her death is held accountable.  We look to the Minister, on behalf of the Government, to assert our values, to speak up for Mahsa Amini and all of the girls, women and other human beings in Iran who are being oppressed and terrorised, and to assert their freedom and independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#TT00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I am happy to support this motion.  I do not believe that there will be much debate on it, given that we are on the side of Senator Chambers and her Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues.  We are here because of how young girls and women are treated in Iran and the deaths of Mahsa Amini, Sarina Esmailzadeh, who was 16 years of age, and all the others whose names we do not know.  Some of the names were mentioned, but there are so many different reports coming out about how many people have died that we do not know the actual figure.<\/p> <p>Since 1979's revolution, Iran has had a civil code of law based on Sharia law, the legal system of Islam.  There are a few facts that I want people to know about Iran and what life for women is like there.  The age of marriage is 13 years for girls.  It was lowered to nine by the revolutionary Government but was raised in 2022, although fathers can obtain judicial permission for their daughters to be married at a younger age.  Between March 2020 and March 2021, the marriages of 31,379 girls between the ages of ten and 14 were registered, an increase of 10.5% on previous years.<\/p> <p>Female activists and civil society organisations face harassment, intimidation, smear campaigns and imprisonment.  For many, protests against the compulsory wearing of the hijab have become a symbolic resistance against the Islamic regime.  These protests have been occurring for years.  This is just the new revolution.  There have been many revolutions down the years where women have tried to stand up.  This time, though, the women are being listened to and supported by their men in Iran, which is good to see.  Someone can be imprisoned not just for protesting the hijab, but for supporting those who do.  Nasrin Sotoudeh was sentenced to 38 years for appearing as the legal defence for a woman protesting the compulsory wearing of the hijab.  Many women who have been arrested for protesting against the compulsory wearing of the hijab say that they were subjected to solitary confinement, torture and beatings.  The law vaguely defines what constitutes acts against morality, so the Gasht-e-Ershad - the Iranian morality police - have lots of power to punish what it deems immoral dress or behaviour.<\/p> <p>A widow can only inherit one eighth of her husband's estate but a widower inherits his wife's entire estate.  A son inherits twice as much as a daughter.  These are basic rights that women do not have.  In Iran, many laws differ between how they are written and how they are applied in practice.  A Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man.  According to the letter of the law, a man can get a divorce simply by declaring it verbally, not even necessarily in his wife's presence.  However, most divorces ending in mutual agreement between a husband and a wife end up in court.  Divorced women are likely to lose custody of the children, especially if they are financially dependent on alimony.  Women need their husbands' or guardians' permission to travel abroad, so they cannot go abroad unless they have their husbands' or fathers' permission to leave the country.  Women arriving at airports sometimes have their permissions revoked by their husbands and are prevented from boarding.<\/p> <p>Amidst all of this, Ireland is set to reopen an embassy in Tehran before the end of 2023.  I visited our embassy there in 1997.  The Iranians are similar to the Irish people.  They are warm and welcoming, and they even have a road called Bobby Sands Street in Tehran.  We have connections with Iran.  However, we need to stand up now.  We need to consider why we are reinstating the embassy.  We closed it in 2012 as a cost-cutting exercise.  I am sure we are not in a better position to reopen it now.  The rationale for this decision seems to flow from Ireland's election to the UN Security Council and our role as a facilitator in the 2015 deal struck on Iran's nuclear programme, which places limits on that programme in return for relieving sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic of Iran.  As always, though, diplomatic handshakes herald business handshakes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One cannot imagine that this move is divorced from the fact that Iran is seen as offering a major growth opportunity for Irish companies exporting goods, particularly medical devices and agricultural products.

Despite constant innovations in the realm of Internet censorship workarounds, there is still no easy, affordable and broad way to restore digital access to people whose governments are actively blocking such access.  The Iranian Government is even cutting access to many video games because of their chat function.  Some communication services have systems in place for attempting to skirt digital blockades.  The secure messaging application Signal, for example, offers tools so people around the world can set up proxy servers that securely relay Signal traffic, bypassing government filters.  Can other social media or instant messaging services do the same?  I call on the Minister to use his powers, where he can, to help in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#TT00300","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.

In pictures of Tehran from the 1970s there are women dressed in mini skirts, fashionable clothes and what we would consider to be normal dress as they walked around the city in a relatively free and relatively normal, at least by western standards, environment.  After the fall of the Shah, religious zealotry and extremism took over.  A series of measures have been put in place, including the morality police, a term that is disgusting in every possible respect and the people in Iran, but particularly women, have suffered the most extraordinary restrictions on their personal liberty and their freedom of expression and speech.  It is such a retrograde act for Iran to take those backward steps.  Of course, we are looking at it through western eyes but we are also looking at it through human eyes.  When we look at what happened, it is very difficult to justify the changes and the extraordinary suppression that have taken place.  <\/p> <p>As I said at the outset, so often in this Chamber we have discussed the problems that exist following the awful illegal invasion of Ukraine, for example, or the suppression of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang in China and the genocide that is occurring there.  I have also raised Belarus in this Chamber on many occasions and much of what we are talking about now, in a slightly different way, echoes what is happening in Belarus.  The suppression of individual citizens by a government is very much there and is what we have heard about, particularly in recent days, in Iran.  That said, it is not a new development by any measure.  Iran does not link itself with good human rights practices.  We know that.  This is not a surprise and yet, in recent days and weeks, we have seen the most extraordinary outcry from ordinary women who have had enough of the suppression of their freedom of expression and who have taken steps that are brave beyond measure.  Theirs is a bravery that we cannot possibly understand coming from the comfort of a stable and fair western democracy where human rights are respected.  The women who have been mentioned by Senator Chambers in her contribution deserve not just our admiration and respect but our support.<\/p> <p>When we talk about human rights, we must accept that talk is not enough.  We have to do more than that.  As we look at the scenes in Tehran and elsewhere, we see people who are being oppressed, murdered, beaten down and brutally subjected to the authority of a state that has no authority, in my view.  What would we do if those people were our daughters, sisters, mothers or friends, or if we knew them?  We feel like we know some of them but we do not.  It is an unfortunate consequence of diplomacy that we sometimes sit by and watch these things happen but I do not agree with Senator Keogan that we should not continue to have diplomatic relations with Iran.  It is incredibly important that we build diplomatic relations but not on a false pretence and not without speaking truth to these people.  The Minister and I have had conversations about the actions of other countries and how it is important for Ireland to stand up to them, not just in the context of the UN Security Council but also in the context of our diplomatic position in the world, as a country that respects the rule of law.  We have spoken of the importance of the ability of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to speak to his counterpart in Iran or any other country and say that we cannot tolerate this, that it is not good enough and that we cannot continue to allow it to happen.  We are not a great military power.  We are not a country that is ever likely to engage in the kind of action that would cause the Iranian Government to sit up and take serious notice but we do have power.  We have soft power.  We have our own voice to use.<\/p> <p>One of the things that must come from this motion is a determination to say to the Minister's counterparts in Iran and to our counterparts in Iran, if we ever get to speak to them, that this is not acceptable and that it does down the ordinary Iranian people who have been mentioned in this debate.  I have travelled to Iran and have found ordinary Iranians to be decent people who want to live decent, ordinary and peaceful lives but they are governed by a litter of rogues, bullies and murderers who absolutely insist on imposing their view of the world on their citizens, particularly their female citizens.  Frustrating as it is, I would really like the Minister to give us some insight into what he thinks we can do about this.  What steps can Ireland take?  What steps can we take, either as a Legislature or as a Government, to send a message to Iran that Ireland will not and cannot stand by and cannot quieten its voice when it comes to the awful, appalling, disgusting and insufferable situation that we are witnessing on our screens, the Internet, television news programmes and elsewhere?  What can we do?  What are we going to do?  How are we going to stand with the women of Iran and tell their Government that this is not okay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#UU00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker I want to welcome Deputy Holly Cairns to the Public Gallery for tonight's debate.

I want to begin by expressing my sympathy and that of Sinn F&eacute;in to the family and friends of Zhina Mahsa Amini.  Zhina was the woman's Kurdish name.  She was killed following her arrest by the grotesquely named and sinister morality police.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this timely and important motion from Senator Chambers.  The women of Iran, Kurdish women and all women, as well as those across the country who are supporting them in their campaigns for progressive change in human rights, are in desperate need of expressions of solidarity internationally, especially at this most challenging time.

I also want to echo the calls of my colleague Deputy Brady in the D&aacute;il last week for the Minister to call in the Iranian ambassador to register the Irish Government's protest at the death of Zhina Amini and the manner in which the authorities in Iran have responded to the ongoing protests.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Sinn F&eacute;in has called for an independent inquiry to determine the exact cause of the death of Jina Mahsa Amini.  This inquiry must be independent and transparent.  I call on the Government to use its position on the UN Security Council to ensure the fate of this current protest movement does not follow the course of previous rounds of protests, when widespread arrests and state violence ended hopes of reform.<\/p><p>We have witnessed the arbitrary arrest of journalists and other chroniclers of the protests, along with the closure of the Internet, as noted by many colleagues already.  As the Minister is aware, these attacks are an attack on free speech.  They also have all the appearance of an attack on the Kurdish people and Kurdish self-determination.  It is important that we do not lose sight of that in the context of this latest struggle.  The international community at all levels must use its influence to make sure the Iranian authorities end their violent and lethal crackdown on protesters.<\/p><p>The Iranian authorities must arrest and bring to justice the killers of Jina Mahsa Amini.  Her family and friends deserve nothing less than full justice for this appalling crime.  We remember all those killed, as noted by Senator Chambers in her opening remarks, feasta.  The killers of Jina Amini need to be uncovered, named and held to account.<\/p><p>I offer my support for the right of the Iranian people, particularly the women of Iran, to exercise their right to protest at the suppression of their human rights.  It is an offence against human decency that in this day and age a woman would be prosecuted because a male-dominated regime has decreed that women must be forced to wear a particular headdress to protect their honour.  As my colleague, Seanad&oacute;ir Boylan, stated on the Order of Business today, women must be free to choose what they want to wear and where, when and how they want to wear it.<\/p><p>This is not the first time we have witnessed outbreaks of protests across Iran by ordinary people seeking human rights equality and dignity.  In these circumstances, every avenue open to the institutions of government in this State must be used.  The women of Iran, Kurdish and otherwise, deserve nothing less than full justice, dignity and respect from the Iranian authorities.  Like Senator Ward, I look forward to hearing what practical steps we can take to support and show our solidarity with those protesting in Iran at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#UU00400","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and commend Senator Chambers on tabling this timely motion on women's rights in Iran.  We have seen photographs of life in the 1970s, with women marching down streets in Tehran wearing very fashionable 1960s and 1970s clothing.  That changed after the overthrow of the Shah and the installation of Ayatollah Khomeini.  Women in Iran had equal divorce rights at a time when women in Ireland could not get a barring order against a violent partner and would not get the right to divorce until 20 years later.  Women in Iran had the right to work and could even become judges.  In Ireland, the marriage ban was not ended until 1973 and, at the time, women could not serve on juries.<\/p> <p>The brutal abuse of Mahsa Amini and her death while in the custody of the Iranian authorities serve as a stark reminder that the rights of women across the globe are not guaranteed and that they can be rolled back.  The first protests against headscarves in Iran, which did not become mandatory until the 1980s, happened three weeks after Ayatollah Khomeini arrived back to the country on an aeroplane from New York.  Since then, there have been mass protests in 1999, 2005, 2009, 2017 and 2019 and there have been extremely brave women such as human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and, more recently, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was sentenced to prison for 38 years - she is on medical leave - simply for defending women's right not to wear a headscarf.  It was brought home much closer to our shores by the five-year prison detention of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclifffe, who only this year was released back to her family.  During a visit to her family in Iran, she was detained unlawfully for five years.  A former British Government and Prime Minister left her there, and nearly caused her to be held there for much longer.<\/p> <p>The recent death in custody of Mahsa Amini is just a new iteration of the same oppressive actions of the regime that have been going on since 1979.  The morality police was set up to ensure that women adhere to the Islamic dress code and is the force responsible for the arrest, detention and untimely death of Mahsa.  We are currently seeing the largest ever rising up of the women's rights movement in Iran.  There is political will for change but those women alone cannot take on the might of an oppressive regime that has been in place since 1979.  The beating heart of women's rights in Iran has never quite gone away, but it has not had the support of the international community, partly because Iran is a nuclear power and partly because it is too important on the world stage.<\/p> <p>The citizens of Iran are currently under an Internet blackout, which is a clear violation of their right to freedom of expression.  In effect, it is stopping Iranian people detailing what is happening to them inside the borders of Iran and co-ordinating the protests in a manner similar to that at the time of the Arab Spring revolution in 2011.  It is evident that the situation is dire and that women are under threat of persecution by the morality police and attack by the security forces for exercising fundamental rights of freedom of expression, assembly and protest and to choose what one wears.  These are very simple freedoms that we take for granted but that Iranian women do not have.<\/p> <p>I wish to touch on something Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said regarding the fact that Mahsa was Kurdish.  Kurdish people are being exploited and brutalised not just in Iran but throughout the region, in the countries that straddle what should be an independent Kurdistan.<\/p> <p>How should the Oireachtas and the Irish people support this fight?  We need to use our diplomatic will and fight and our role on the UN Security Council to condemn the Iranian Government for what it is doing.  We need to put forward the call for women to have the right to choose what they wear, for people to have the right to go on to third level education, for women to have the right to divorce and for the marriage age for women in Iran to be increased.  I do not want to walk away from the Chamber without us having a clear ask of the Minister in terms of what he can do, particularly in the context of Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council, to support women in Iran and let them know, among all the other revolutions and protests they have had, this one will not be in vain.  It will not go away because the will is there among women in Iran.  We now need international will to support the largest women's rights revolution, which is happening before our eyes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#VV00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and, in particular, I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling the motion.

We need to consider what solidarity actually looks like, what liberation means and the type of impact we can have.  The online conversations on this issue in recent weeks and the actions of various types of groups and opportunistic activists that co-opt situations such as this for their own gain in a very negative way, make me apprehensive in the context of how we speak in this Chamber and the issues we discuss.  These are issues that we should be talking about and on which we should be demanding change but, in so doing, we need to be careful to watch out for that interventionist ideology in terms of further oppressing Iranian people through sanctions, the removing of diplomacy and those types of things.  Obviously I condemn in the strongest terms the repression that has been mounted in response to the nationwide protests in Iran, with security forces applying brutal violence and targeting young people, especially those from the Kurdish and Baloch regions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want to express my solidarity with those who are fighting and have fought for so long.<br\/><br\/>We need to be careful in our conversations and in the discourse surrounding this as I think we can risk co-opting Mahsa Amini&rsquo;s death.  We need to be careful of the platforming of voices that are calling for intervention, which has happened somewhat in this Chamber today although not in the motion, in regard to the imposition of sanctions on Iran, or restricting the agency of Iranian or Kurdish women who have long resisted state violence, while underplaying the historic trajectory of a contemporary feminist movement in Iran.  This evening, I have instead chosen to platform their voices in my contribution, drawing from a number of articles and petitions circulating online which speak to the realities of what has long been a struggle for human rights and equality in Iran.<br\/><br\/>The Iranian women's struggle for equality long predates these latest protests, preceding the 1905 constitutional revolution and continuing in various forms through many political crises and coups in the 20th century, including the imposition of Sharia law through the Iranian revolution in 1979.  What we are witnessing at the moment is a continuation of a revolutionary movement which has existed for over 100 years for women's basic rights.<br\/><br\/>While the international attention in recent weeks has forged networks of solidarity around the world which could help to confront state violence, imperialism, patriarchy and capitalism globally, it has also reinvigorated interventionists, oppressive discourse and opportunistic activism.  Claiming solidarity with Iranian women while also supporting exclusionary conceptions of womanhood that facilitate violence against trans people is tokenistic at best and erases the struggle of LGBTQ+ communities that have also been the target of state violence in Iran.  Advocating for human rights and freedom of Iranian women while aligning oneself with movements which seek to restrict women's control of their own bodies is illogical.  Calling for the imposition of further sanctions or hostile foreign policy towards Iran fails to recognise the fact that these responses have historically worsened the living conditions of marginalised people, including many women in Iran.<br\/><br\/>Up to 2022, Iran was the most sanctioned country in the world.  Reports have found that sanctions have caused unnecessary suffering to Iranian citizens, who are inflicted with a range of diseases and medical conditions which disproportionately impact women and vulnerable groups.  While the West has long claimed solidarity with Iranians, the sanctions we have put in place have crippled their economy and restricted the agency of Iranians to push for change on their own terms.  The latest moment in the long struggle for freedom and justice for Iranian women must not be appropriated as a pawn with which to justify interventionism, Western-backed regime change or the imposition of widespread economic, political and psychological suffering through sanctions.<br\/><br\/>I want to conclude by reading into the record part of an article written by Yasmin Gholizadeh, which calls for a particular type of solidarity from the international community.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>\tWhen calling for solidarity with Iranian protesters resisting state violence, we must &hellip; look towards simultaneously resisting the imperial structures that have disproportionately impacted the lives of women in Iran.  Solidarity to Iranian and Kurdish women involves holding imperial powers and opportunists accountable for hijacking the protests to justify sanctions that have strangled a population.<br \/><br \/>Our international solidarity must be radical, opposed to all co-option, and remain rooted within the grassroots, across all borders; we cannot legitimise the very structures of sanctions and border legislation that have harmed Iranians for so long.<br \/><br \/>&hellip; Instead of calling on international powers to intervene, we must defend the agency of Iranian and Kurdish women to imagine and fight for liberation on their own terms. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#VV00300","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I see from a response to a parliamentary question that he gave on 6 October that he has taken a very strong line on this issue.  The Minister stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am deeply concerned about the unjustifiable and disproportionate response of the Iranian authorities to Iranian citizens protesting against the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody after her arrest for allegedly violating dress code regulations.  Ireland does not believe that anything short of full equality for women should be the objective, anywhere in the world.  No woman should lose her life because of how she chooses to dress herself. <\/blockquote> <p>The Minister also commended the women and men of Iran, as we should, for the way they have publicly taken on this situation against fierce opposition from a Government that is very dictatorial.  The Minister also met with the Iranian foreign minister to express his concern on behalf of the Irish Government and the Irish people.  I welcome his strong line on this.<\/p><p>Mahsa Amini is another victim of Iran&rsquo;s continuing repression and organised discrimination against women, and many in this Chamber today have repeated that particular line.  We must at all times, even in this country and even though we are a long way from Iran, stand up for these people and these women because they are entitled to freedom of opinion, expression and belief.  I am glad to see that this Chamber is totally condemning the violence against women and the denial of basic human dignity when imposing compulsory hijab policy designed by the state authorities.<\/p><p>Many of the speakers before me have spoken about the brave people who have stood up.  There are many journalists in Iran today who are imprisoned because of the death of this young lady and because of what the authorities have done.  I refer to Nilufar Hamidi, a women's rights activist who wrote about this situation and is now in solitary confinement.  There are also many others and, for example, Saeed Rashido has also been jailed due to speaking out on this matter.  The Committee to Protect Journalists has called for all of those journalists in Iran to be released right away.<\/p><p>We talk about morality and our belief and understanding of the word &ldquo;morality&rdquo;.  When I look up the word &quot;morality&quot;, it stands for ethics and nobility.  I cannot even understand why these police are called &quot;morality police&quot;.  The western world is right to stand against the Iranian authorities and to support these women against this type of abuse and beatings.  We are now told that tanks are going to be moved into Kurdish areas to try to prevent more protests.  We must stand with these very brave people, we must stand for those women's rights and we must at all times back our Government and our Minister.  I applaud my party colleague, Senator Chambers, for bringing this matter before the House and I know she has been quite passionate about it.  I applaud all Members for speaking out here this evening.  That is my full contribution.  I do not think anybody should shy away from doing what is the right thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#WW00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to the Chamber and thank him for his time.  The motion is aimed at expressing our solidarity with the people of Iran, particularly the women and girls who are fighting for basic human freedoms.  Like all Members, I am sure, I have seen clips online of these women standing up for themselves and each other despite the great personal risk they are taking on in doing so.  Their courage is inspiring.  I recognise that we live in a world where different countries have different cultures and different values, but there is no excuse for violence against women, no excuse for discrimination against women and no excuse for women not to have basic human rights, which is something the women of Iran face on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>As Members will be aware, the death of Mahsa Amini was the spark for these protests.  She was arrested for not wearing a hijab and, according to reports, beaten severely by the police for this, ultimately leading to her death days later in hospital.  That such a thing can happen in 2022 is beyond belief.  I can only hope that her death will bring about long overdue change in Iran and that these protests will achieve their aims.  As all Members do, I am sure, I join the global calls for Iran to stop the excessive use of force which has so far been its response to these protests and resulted in at least eight more deaths.  Iran must change for the good of its people and the good of the country.  May Mahsa Amini and others who have suffered a similar fate at the hands of the Iranian police rest in peace and may their deaths not be in vain.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ollie Crowe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on his work in this area.

In particular, I thank Senator Chambers for drafting this motion, which I am happy to support.  I am particularly happy to have this debate on the International Day of the Girl, which is also appropriate.<\/p> <p>I extend my condolences, as other have, to the family of Mahsa Amini and commend them on their bravery in focusing the attention of the world on the tragic and unnecessary death of their daughter.  No woman should lose her life because of how she chooses to dress.  No one in detention should be subjected to any form of mistreatment.<\/p> <p>I also take this opportunity to commend the women and men of Iran who have exercised their fundamental right to assemble in protest.  I also offer my condolences to the families and loved ones of all those who have lost their lives in protests since the death of Mahsa Amini on 16 September.<\/p> <p>It is unacceptable that Mahsa Amini was arrested for alleged dress code violations by the Iranian morality police and that she was then subjected to such violence in detention to the extent that she lost her life.  Ireland does not believe that anything short of full equality for women should be the objective anywhere in the world.  The circumstances of Mahsa&rsquo;s death have understandably led to protests across Iran but also in other parts of the world.  I am deeply concerned about the unjustifiable and disproportionate response of the Iranian authorities to those Iranian citizens who are peacefully protesting.  This response has resulted in further loss of life as well as a large number of injuries.  People in Iran have the right to peacefully protest, as does anyone.  That right must be ensured in all circumstances.<\/p> <p>Iran has signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has adopted the Beijing declaration and platform for action, which commits Iran to ensure the full implementation of the human rights of women and girls as an integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Iran is also party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR.  I call on Iranian authorities to strictly abide by the principles enshrined in the ICCPR, including the right to peaceful assembly.<\/p> <p>The decision to severely restrict Internet access by Iranian authorities and to block instant messaging platforms is a further cause for concern and is a clear violation of freedom of expression.<\/p> <p>On 21 September last, I met with the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, at the UN General Assembly high level week in New York.  I relayed to him my deep concerns regarding the circumstances of Ms Amini&rsquo;s detention and death.  I spoke with him again by phone last Thursday.  In our conversations I advised the Iranian minister that it is crucial that an independent and credible investigation into the circumstances of Mahsa Amini&rsquo;s death is carried out and that those responsible for violence against her are held accountable.  I also relayed to him the unequivocal condemnation from across the political spectrum in Ireland of the death of Mahsa Amini and the response of the Iranian security forces to peaceful protests.  It is very clear in the statements this evening that all parties and none are speaking from the same position.  In addition, I reminded the minister of the obligations Iran has as a party to the ICCPR.<\/p> <p>The family of Mahsa Amini have objected to the findings of the Iranian coroner&rsquo;s report, which was released last Friday and claimed that Mahsa Amini died due to pre-existing conditions.  Mahsa&rsquo;s parents deserve to know the truth about how their 22-year-old daughter died.  I repeat my call here today to the Iranian Government to allow for an independent investigation into the cause of her death.<\/p> <p>While the case of Mahsa Amini has rightly attracted worldwide attention, unfortunately it is far from unique in Iran.  The status of women and girls in Iran is very worrying.  Iran is one of only four countries which have not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  While there is a high level of enrolment of women in all levels of education in Iran, under the civil code women continue to be deprived of equal rights to men in marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance.  There is no law to prevent violence against women, including gender-based violence such as marital rape, to prohibit child marriage or to prosecute abusers.  Gender equality remains inadequate in the economic sphere and, in particular, in the political sphere.  There are laws on chastity and on dress codes which apply only to women.  Iran is the only country in the world which legally requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf.  In November 2021, the President of Iran signed into law a Bill which limits access to contraception and abortion.<\/p> <p>The human rights situation in the country has long been of great concern, including the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, political activists , journalists and human rights defenders.  Citizens of Iran do not fully enjoy fundamental freedoms to which they are entitled, such as freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.  I know Members of this House and of the other House have mentioned to me the situation of the Baha&rsquo;i community.  There are numerous and credible reports of torture and ill-treatment of those detained in Iranian prisons.  Ireland has not hesitated to raise these concerns directly with Iran.  I have raised these issues when I have met with the minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in the past number of weeks, as I have mentioned previously, and when I visited Tehran in February of this year.  I have always been clear in letting him know of our concerns regarding the treatment of women in Iran as well as of Ireland&rsquo;s other long-standing concerns on human rights in Iran, including those of LGBTQI+ persons, respect for freedom of religious belief, and, of course, the use of the death penalty, which we have been very consistent on.<\/p> <p>The current UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran took up his position in 2018 and is mandated by the UN Human Rights Council, HRC, under Resolution 37\/30 to monitor and investigate human rights violations in Iran and to submit reports to the General Assembly and the HRC.  I have expressed my concern directly to the Iranian foreign minister that Iran is preventing the special rapporteur from even visiting the country.  The HRC mandate also calls on Iran to co-operate fully with the special rapporteur and to permit him to access the country.<\/p> <p>I have also encouraged Iran to facilitate a visit to Tehran by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, who many in this House will know well, and to engage with the European Union on human rights issues on a formal and structured basis.  The EU holds human rights dialogues with more than 30 countries to discuss topics of particular importance to the EU, including women&rsquo;s rights, freedom of expression and combating torture.  While I have delivered a message at the highest level to the Iranian Government, I certainly will not hesitate to summon the Iranian ambassador in Dublin if I believe that is helpful at a future date.  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the embassy and just yesterday we relayed again our concerns regarding the situation in Iran directly to its ambassador.<\/p> <p>As Senators will be aware, next year Ireland plans to reopen our embassy in Tehran which we closed for financial reasons in 2012.  The first phase of this process began in August 2021 with the appointment of a charg&eacute; d'affaires co-located with the German Embassy in Tehran.  Part of the reason for this decision is that Ireland has an important diplomatic role in respect of the Iranian nuclear deal, which is known as the joint comprehensive plan of action or JCPOA.  On joining the UN Security Council in 2021, Ireland was appointed as facilitator to Resolution 22\/31 which relates to the implementation of the JCPOA.  Ireland strongly supports the Iranian nuclear deal.  It was a major achievement of multilateral diplomacy and we believe it is the best mechanism for ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme.  We are, therefore, deeply concerned by the steps Iran has taken on its nuclear programme since the US withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018, including the irreversible nature of some of those activities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The US, under President Biden, has indicated its willingness to return to the deal, and talks began in Vienna in April 2021.  I have engaged extensively with all parties to the deal and urged them to work with urgency towards the full restoration of the agreement, which has been extremely close.  This has included extensive political level contact with Iran on nuclear issues, including in my recent discussions with the Iranian foreign minister and during my visit to Tehran last February.  Preserving the deal is essential to strengthening non-proliferation in the Middle East to act as an important security and confidence-building measure in the region and potentially create a platform for an improved relationship with Iran and its neighbours.<\/p><p>The death of Mahsa Amini and the protests in Iran have rightly attracted worldwide condemnation.  Discussions are already under way within the EU on an appropriate response, including asset freezes and travel bans affecting the specific individuals and entities responsible for the repression we have seen in recent weeks.  I agree with some that we need to be cautious in how we apply sanctions, but the EU, unlike many countries in the world, generally applies sanctions in a very targeted manner.  The widespread sanctions that have impacted the Iranian economy are very much linked to the breakdown of the nuclear deal, and these are quite separate from the targeted measures of the EU concerning human rights abuses.  It is important to make that distinction.  I will be discussing this matter with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting next Monday in Luxembourg and I expect there will be a firm and united response.<\/p><p>When I spoke to the Iranian Foreign Minister last week, I was very straight with him and said that unless there is a credible investigation into the circumstances of Mahsa Amini's death and a proportionate response to the legitimate demands of peaceful protesters, there will be a clear EU response.  Threats of retaliation by Iran, which we have heard, will certainly not impact the EU's determination in responding.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators for the debate.  In particular, I thank Senator Chambers.  I will take the very strong views of this Chamber to the conversations we will have at EU level.  That is how Ireland can be most impactful.  Whether it is at UN level, at the Security Council, or at EU level, through collective EU action, Ireland is influential beyond its size.  We need to use that influence and our credibility appropriately at times like this.  I hope I will be able to do that on behalf of the Senators successfully next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#XX00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Devlin to the Visitors Gallery.

I thank all Members for contributing to the debate.  Its quality was excellent.  Senators are very informed on the issue.  It is important that the Oireachtas debate these issues.  We have spoken a lot this evening about the actions Ireland can take.  Even having this debate to call out the human rights abuses for what they are is an important action.  The abuses are unacceptable and disgraceful and will not be tolerated.  That is a powerful message to send from our Parliament, through our Government, to the Iranian Government and the Foreign Minister with whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, engages regularly.<\/p> <p>It is important also that we consider Ireland's actions.  I take on board what Senator Ruane has said about sanctions.  It is important that we do not take action that makes us feel good about what we are doing when that action does not have the desired outcome.  Our actions should be informed by what the Iranian people themselves want by way of support from us.<\/p> <p>Many Members spoke about what has occurred over recent decades.  What has been happening has not just happened in recent weeks.  There has been an ongoing movement to fight for and advocate women's rights.  What has changed in recent years is that we see more and now know what is happening.  It is so much more publicised.  No matter how hard the Iranian Government tries to lock down the Internet, prevent discourse and debate and prevent videos from being posted online, we see what is happening and what it is doing.  We will not forget it.  That is important.  In the past decade, we have had access to more information and are so much more connected as a global community.<\/p> <p>Regarding what is frightening about what is happening, Senator Moynihan spoke about the changes that took place between the early 1970s and when the Shah fell in 1979.  In the early 1970s and earlier, women in Iran enjoyed many of the freedoms they do not enjoy today.  It is a matter of a side-by-side comparison accounting for how far Ireland has come as a country in improving women's rights.  The way we treated women in this country not so long ago was horrific and we are still dealing with the fallout.  The scars are still very much evident on women today because of what this country has been through.  Therefore, we are not speaking from a position of judgment but acknowledging, as Senator Moynihan did, that women's rights are not guaranteed and can always be reversed if we do not remain vigilant.  We must always stand up for what we believe are basic human rights and for dignity for all citizens, be they women or men.<\/p> <p>In my opening remarks, I did not mention the women of Afghanistan.  Let us not forget their plight and that what is happening in Iran is also happening in other parts of the world.  I fear that we and the international community have become very silent about what is happening in Afghanistan.  I do not see any significant or serious steps being taken to try to deal with the issue, which has arisen only very recently.  I sincerely hope the protests that have been taking place in recent weeks in Iran will not be in vain and that change will come about.  I hope the deaths of Mahsa Amini and other women who have lost their lives, including teenage girls, will not be in vain and that we will see genuine liberation of women in Iran and the upholding of the basic freedoms to assemble, protest and live one's life as desired.  That is the hope I hold for the women of Iran.<\/p> <p>I wish to finish by using the statement Iranian women are making: \"Woman, life, freedom\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#YY00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this important debate.
