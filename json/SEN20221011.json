The issue on the table is the exclusion of those aged 18 to 20 from participating in the community employment, CE, scheme.  It is generally accepted that the Government should reward the behaviour we want to encourage in our citizens, and being an active citizen in our economy is one such behaviour we should champion.  While this has been the case for years, the events of budget 2023 led me to think about what message the Government is trying to achieve through the CE scheme.  Budget 2023 saw a &euro;5 increase in the CE top-up payment from &euro;22.50 to &euro;27.50 from January 2023.  Meanwhile those in receipt of a weekly jobseeker's payment will receive an increase of &euro;12 per week.<\/p> <p>The CE scheme is designed to help people who are long-term unemployed or otherwise disadvantaged to get back to work by offering part-time or temporary placements in jobs based within local communities.  Participants can take up other part-time work during the CE placement.  The work is community based.  The training provided through CE is delivered with a quality assurance framework.  When a person's CE placement ends, the person is encouraged to seek a job elsewhere using the skills, experience and training gained while participating in the CE scheme.  The duration of a CE scheme placement is for 12 months, with some exceptions.  The general qualifying age for CE is 21.  There are exceptions to this, of course.  The CE drug rehabilitation programmes are available for persons aged 18 or over who are in recovery or referred for a rehabilitation place on a CE scheme.  Members of the Traveller and Roma communities can qualify from the age of 18.  Ex-offenders aged 18 or over are referred by the following agencies: the Probation Service, the linkage service, the gate service, the resettlement service and the Irish Prison Service.  Refugees aged 18 or over who are authenticated by the Department of Justice, have a valid work permit or Garda National Immigration Bureau card with stamp 4 and are in receipt of any Department of Social Protection payment for any length of time, can quality for a CE scheme.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to advise whether the current influx of refugees over the age of 18 will be in a position to take up a CE scheme.  After all, this would encourage social integration of refugees within communities.  The current social welfare payment for 18-year-olds is &euro;117.70.  This payment will increase to &euro;129.70 in January 2023.  Approximately 20,000 people under the age of 25 were getting jobseeker's allowance at the end of September 2022.  Why are we saying to 18-year-olds, 19-year-olds and 20-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training that they cannot avail of our work support scheme, and all they can do is collect their dole money?  It is not empowering to our young people to reward them for doing nothing.  It is lazy governance.  As a Government, we must do better for our teens and our young people.  One will never get a career or an opportunity by lying in bed all day and we should not reward it either.  Given that the take-up of CE and T&uacute;s programmes is at an all-time low, surely these programmes should be opened up for this age cohort as a matter of urgency.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#B00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Keogan for raising this issue.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, who could not make it to the debate.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the excellent work that is done on the full range of schemes supported by the Department, including community employment schemes, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, and the contribution these schemes and their workers make to communities throughout the county.  We see in every county, and the Senator and I certainly see it in our county of Meath, high participation across the schemes.<\/p> <p>Currently, more than 26,000 participants and 1,635 supervisors are employed on the three main schemes.  Overall, these schemes have a budget allocation of &euro;540 million in 2022.  Work schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s are positive initiatives that enable the long-term unemployed to make a positive contribution to their communities while upskilling for prospective future employment.  The role they play in our communities is well recognised.  At present, more than 18,500 places are supported on community employment, with a budget of over &euro;375 million available to support the scheme in 2022.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputies Humphreys, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and I announced reforms to the community employment scheme on 21 December 2021 and again on 29 June last.  These changes were introduced to improve the operation of the employment support schemes and maintain vital services within our communities.  These changes included provision to allow community employment scheme participants who reach 60 years of age to remain on the scheme until they reach State pension age.  Reducing the age from 62 to 60 to allow participants to remain on the community employment scheme until they reach State pension age was considered on the basis that this cohort of participants is least likely to progress to employment in the open labour market.  It was also part of a type of consultation based on a number of visits by the Minister, the Minister of State and me to the community enterprise offices and community employment offices, engagement with supervisors and managers over a long period as well as many debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have had considerable discussion on this matter in recent years.  We all see the value of these schemes to our communities and to people in their 60s who want to stay in schemes and do not want to have to go back into the work environment.<\/p> <p>Currently, 27% of community employment scheme participants are between the ages of 60 and 66 and almost half of community employment scheme participants are aged over 55.  Community employment was originally only open to participants over the age of 25 until a change was introduced by the Department of Social Protection back in 2017, which reduced the eligible age for participation to where it is today, at 21 years.  However, the community employment scheme is already available to those in receipt of disability-related payments and is also available to members of the Traveller and Roma communities, refugees, ex-offenders and inhabitants of offshore islands from the age of 18.<\/p> <p>All places on the drugs rehabilitation CE scheme are available to persons aged 18 years or over who are in recovery and referred for a rehabilitation place on a community employment scheme.  While the scheme is not open to all customers between the ages of 18 and 21, a wide range of supports in the Department of Social Protection is available to this cohort of young people.  It is certainly not the case that there are no supports or that these young people are left to their own devices.  These supports include T&uacute;s, the work placement experience programme and the JobsPlus scheme, along with a broad range of education and training programmes.  I ask any young person in this age cohort to engage directly with the Department of Social Protection and the Intreo offices because a team of caseworkers is ready to work with and assist them on a journey back to work or into a training course or work placement experience programme.<\/p> <p>At every business event I attend on behalf of the Department, I stress the importance of giving young people a chance through these schemes and that supports are available to assist the future employee as well as the employer.  Strong subsidies are available to both sides to make it worthwhile for everybody to engage with these supports, no matter what age they are, and to follow the pathways to work programme set out in the document.<\/p> <p>To give an example, T&uacute;s is an employment support scheme, similar to community employment, and, as I mentioned, it is open to those between the ages of 18 and 21.  It is worth looking at the participants in that scheme to give some background on research for the lowering of the age on CE schemes.  The level of participation on T&uacute;s for 18- to 21-year-olds is just over 3% and for 22- to 25-year-olds, it is just over 6%.  To be clear, the Senator is asking us to open up schemes for which there does not seem to be great demand because the age group in question avails of the other support schemes, generally the work placement experience programme.  The low take-up figures for T&uacute;s indicate that such an employment support scheme is not a preferred option for this age group.  Coupled with the range of other educational, training and work placements available to this age group, this indicates that extending community employment schemes to all customers in this age group would not make an appreciable difference to participation rates.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The live register figures show that 63% of long-term unemployed jobseekers are between the ages of 25 and 54.

I necessarily agree that we should encourage everybody who is able to work to do so if at all possible.  That is why every effort is made by the Government, including the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to make the case that work always pays and should always pay.  That is why much of the work of the Government in the past two and a half years has been on strengthening pay and conditions and the work environment.  The protections are in place.  There is sick pay legislation coming into effect, there is auto-enrolment, and the minimum wage has gone up by 80%.  Therefore, every effort is being made to make sure it is worthwhile going to work.  In the majority of cases, it absolutely is.  A range of supports is available to the cohort in question to take up work or obtain training and skills.  We constantly work to encourage people to take up work.  There are extra caseworkers assigned under Pathways to Work to work with the newly unemployed or long-term unemployed so they can find their way back into work, avail of the supports and join up the dots.<\/p> <p>The job placement programme is a really useful one to encourage people to get used to a work environment again and get close to a job.  We try to encourage everyone to participate in the schemes.  When someone is at work, everyone generally benefits, including the community, business and the person&rsquo;s family.<\/p> <p>With regard to the payments of &euro;12, the response in the budget is a cost-of-living initiative to recognise that everyone on a fixed income, regardless of the reason, is under extreme pressure when it comes to paying bills.  Likewise, anybody who is going to work is also under pressure.  That is why we made changes to the tax system, the working family payment and other payments, again recognising there is a cost-of-living pressure.  The argument in this regard is different from the argument as to who can avail of what scheme in normal times.  That is what the response is about.<\/p> <p>Pathways to Work is a document that tries to focus our efforts on encouraging everybody who could be at work but who is not to return to work.  It is to make it easier for them.  Everybody has a unique story, and our caseworkers understand that.  The range of schemes allows the journey to happen in different ways for different people.  I encourage everybody not in work to return to work through education, training, placements or apprenticeships.  There is a range of initiatives.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, is very much behind these and driving them, along with other key Departments, including the Department of Education and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#D00500","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scientific Research","time":1665495000,"counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#E00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#E00150","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  We are discussing Ireland's membership of CERN, which is arguably the world's greatest scientific laboratory and certainly engages some of its greatest scientists, engineers and technicians.  I am glad to welcome to the Public Gallery several researchers who have a specific interested in this issue.  As the Minister of State is aware, CERN is focused on how our universe is made up.  It has been responsible for some of the things we take for granted in many ways, including the World Wide Web, touchscreens, positron emission tomography scanners in hospitals, work that has been done in cancer care and changes that have happened in construction.  Almost every European country is either a member or an associate member of CERN or has a co-operation agreement with the body, except Ireland.<\/p> <p>We pride ourselves on our multilateralism.  Where we see an organisation like CERN facilitating co-operation and collaboration among the world's top scientists, we should be at its heart.  These scientists are addressing challenges that we all face, including Ireland.  Approximately 16,000 scientists from more than 110 countries worldwide have been involved in some of these projects.  Yet, Ireland's official policy is that members of our research community are not actively encouraged to take part because we are not a member of CERN.  An equivalent Government policy, and the equivalent of what we are saying to our researchers, would be if we were to tell our actors that they could not get involved in productions in Hollywood.  Another example, and the Minister of State will appreciate this, would be if we were to tell GAA players that they could not play in Croke Park.  By excluding Ireland and the members of our research community from CERN, we are not allowing them to perform on the international stage.<\/p> <p>All of us, including the Minister of State, are aware that we have top-class, global-level researchers in our universities, higher education institutions, HEIs, and research institutes nationwide who are engaged in some of the work CERN is involved in.  This includes artificial intelligence, quantum computing and engineering, communications and nanotechnology, etc.  We have top-class researchers in all these areas.  The Government under its Innovation 2020 policy committed to examining membership.  The process of discussions on membership started in 2016.  In November 2019, the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation recommended that we join or at least commence the process of seeking associate membership of CERN.  I raised this issue here on 3 March 2022 as a Commencement matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  On that occasion, he seemed to indicate that the only concern was the cost and not the principle of joining CERN.<\/p> <p>I will use an example to illustrate this point.  One recommendation in the Government's Innovation 2020 strategy was that Ireland would join several other organisations, including the European Southern Observatory, ESO, the European Life-science Infrastructure for Biological Information, ELIXIR, and the Low Frequency Array, LOFAR, network.  If we look at the outcome from our membership of the ESO, we will see that Irish HEIs and companies have already benefited enormously.  Partly, this is because the Government has not just joined the organisation but it has also set out a national space strategy for enterprise.  The impact of this is not necessarily concerned with what studying is going on in space, which has certainly been of benefit, but with how this affects our lives on the ground.  Therefore, I am not just asking that we join CERN; I also believe we should have a national strategy for CERN which ensures that we can avail of the benefits of membership and that our researchers can be actively involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#E00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this issue.

I also acknowledge the presence of our guests in the Public Gallery from the research community.<\/p> <p>Under the National Development Plan 2018-2027, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government outlined its intention to review Ireland's membership of CERN.  The Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 to initiate discussions with several international research organisations.  Four organisations were identified - CERN, the ESO, ELIXIR and LOFAR - and securing membership of three of these organisations has now been completed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Niall Collins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These organisations were identified based on a 2015 study that reviewed the costs and benefits of Ireland&rsquo;s existing and potential international research organisation memberships.  Impact 2030, the national strategy for research and innovation, undertakes a further review and optimises Ireland&rsquo;s membership of international research organisations to ensure that our engagement reflects our existing and emerging strategic priorities.<\/p><p>This follows on from the Oireachtas report, The Case for Irish Membership of CERN, published in November 2019.  It made three recommendations regarding Ireland&rsquo;s potential membership of CERN.  First, that negotiations start with CERN immediately with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member as soon as possible.  Second, that after three years as an associate member of CERN, the Department will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s associate membership of CERN and assess whether there is a case to be made for moving towards full membership.  Third, that efforts be made to fund the annual fee for associate membership of CERN from within the business, enterprise and innovation Vote.<\/p><p>The committee found that membership would generate opportunities not only for Irish enterprise, but also for its research community.  It noted that membership would bring opportunities for Irish researchers to participate in CERN&rsquo;s scientific programmes, working at the frontiers of scientific knowledge and using state-of-the-art technology and engineering.  Membership would have other benefits, the committee stated.  It would also enable researchers and companies in Ireland to collaborate with the best researchers and leading companies across Europe in the development of world-leading technology.  Membership would provide new opportunities for Irish researchers to win funding from the EU framework programme, Horizon Europe, through their participation in CERN.  Irish citizens would also be eligible for staff positions and fellowships at CERN.  The opportunity of a scientific breakthrough and technological advances are significant benefits to CERN membership that do not necessarily give a quantifiable return.  However, the committee also noted some concerns with the potential return for Ireland associated with the high cost of full membership.  The report therefore considers that associate membership may be a better option.  Associate membership would allow Ireland to have a reduced contribution.  However, it would also limit the available return and Ireland would not have a say in major decisions taken by CERN.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the report, Irish officials have been in regular contact with CERN.  Following the establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, active engagement with CERN has continued regarding the membership options for Ireland, the application process and the associated costs.  While Ireland has made considerable progress in its participation in international organisations in recent years, it is acknowledged that membership of CERN would be the next step in consolidating that progress.<\/p><p>Current agreed estimates with CERN show that associate membership will cost &euro;1.52 million per annum, subject to indexation, for a period of between three and five years.  It should be noted that based on current indications received from CERN, the eventual cost if Ireland were to pursue full membership, at 2022 prices, would be circa &euro;15.2 million annually and a one-off special contribution of about &euro;19.1 million due on the same day a country becomes a full member.  While the benefits of CERN membership are recognised as significant, the cost is also significant and must be addressed in the context of other Departmental and national investment priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#E00300","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I am a little disappointed because we do not seem to be making much progress.

I have raised this issue here previously.  On 10 November 2021, I asked the Minister to make a statement on the incineration of baby organs in Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, and asked what changes he proposed to bring forward.<\/p> <p>The backdrop to this is a sad case in which the organs of 18 children in the maternity hospital in Cork were incinerated without the knowledge or licence of their parents.  The parents were horrified that this happened.  It was the subject of an \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" report afterwards.  These poor kids were lost and their organs, which were kept to understand what happened, were subsequently destroyed by incineration in Antwerp, Belgium.<\/p> <p>We have been talking about bringing forward legislation to make sure that this could never again happen.  As a matter of principle, we should have legislation to ensure this kind of issue can be dealt with so we do not have a scenario in which parents are now protesting again and looking for information as to when this legislation might be brought forward.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, took my previous Commencement matter on this issue and gave me a commitment that the work of the Parliamentary Counsel was progressing and that the Bill would be published by the end of 2021.  2021 has come and gone and there is no legislation that I can see.  The Bill started its progress through the Oireachtas in 2019.  It was proposed in May 2019.  The damning issue here is that the Bill brings forward recommendations from a report published in early 2006 by the then Minister, Mary Harney.  We have been fighting since 2006 to bring this legislation all the way through the Oireachtas so that parents in this unbelievable scenario will have due responsibility and due rights when it comes to these organs that are being kept for medical research and an understanding of what happens.<\/p> <p>This is a traumatic moment for people.  They have been promised legislation continuously but it has not been brought forward.  This is the safeguard and the safety net they require at all times so they can make sure that the incident we have seen in Cork, which has also happened in other jurisdictions, will never again happen.<\/p> <p>I spoke about baby Hope Kelleher when I raised this issue previously.  Her parents contacted me from Australia about the issue.  Her organs were destroyed.  The parents had hoped her organs could be buried in a family plot.  Her organs were never brought back to them.  We need a timeline brought forward to ensure this can never happen again.  The families affected have heard promises, promises, promises.  The human tissue Bill has gone around these Houses since long before I came here.  I want a timeline as to when the Bill will be published so we can get this legislation on the Statute Book and offer due protection in order that what happened in Cork in 2020 can never again happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#G00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for bringing this important Commencement matter to the floor of the Seanad.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As committed to in the programme for Government, the enactment of the human tissue (transplantation, post-mortem, anatomical examination and public display) Bill remains a priority for the Government.  It is complex legislation that will include provisions on organ donation, transplantation, hospital post mortem practice and procedures, anatomical examination and public display of bodies after death.  In particular, the Bill seeks to further embed in legislation the idea that consent is a defining principle across all of these sensitive matters.<\/p><p>A key priority for the Government in bringing forward the Bill is to increase organ donation and transplantation rates and to make organ donations the norm in Ireland in situations where the opportunity arises.  The human tissue Bill will help to achieve this through the introduction of a soft opt-out system of consent for organ donation under which consent will be deemed unless a person has registered a wish to not become an organ donor after death.  The Bill will also legislate for living organ donation and altruistic donation, both of which will help to increase the donor pool in Ireland.<\/p><p>Given the complexity of the Bill, a number of challenges have been encountered in drafting the legislation that have had to be resolved before publication is possible.  Among other things, officials have had to develop three separate regulatory frameworks and amend the extant EU directives of 2006 and 2012 accordingly.  This has necessitated intensive engagement between the Department of Health and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Medical Council.  Department of Health officials have also undertaken an intensive round of engagement with stakeholders engaged in organ donation and transplantation over recent months to ensure the legislation meets the needs of this very important community.<\/p><p>As Senator Lombard is aware, as well as providing a legislative basis for organ donation and transplant the Bill will introduce a regulatory regime for the conduct of post mortems in hospital settings.  Under the general scheme of the Bill provisions were to be restricted solely to hospital post mortem activities.  However, in light of recent events a review is being undertaken to see whether an expansion of provisions to encompass certain aspects of coronial post mortem activities might be possible.  Intensive engagement is ongoing between officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Justice with the Attorney General and his officials to find a resolution to this issue.  Any solution found will be complementary to the recommendations of the recent HSE internal audit report on compliance by hospitals with the HSE standards and recommended practices for post mortem examination services and the work of the post mortem examination services group that is working on updating guidelines for post mortem practice.  Department of Health officials continue to work on finalising the legislation and drafting the Bill and it is at an advanced stage.  Government approval for publication of the human tissue Bill will be sought as soon as possible and is expected this Oireachtas term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#G00400","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group I extend our deepest sympathies to the families, those who have lost loved ones and to the entire community.  I strongly commend the fantastic work done by the emergency services who were on the scene dealing with what was an unthinkable tragedy.  The scale of it is phenomenal.  I also commend those working in the hospital.  They had to step up their emergency response.  The scale of what they had to deal with in a short space of time was such that if it had to be planned for it would be difficult even to plan.  They did everything they could.<\/p> <p>I commend those working on the ground now providing meals because the community has lost its only shop.  I commend the Government for using the existing humanitarian scheme that would normally be put in place for flood disasters to try and assist families out of direct financial assistance in the weeks and months ahead.  It is an unthinkable tragedy.<\/p> <p>It is important while we will be discussing the tragedy, and it will be top of the news agenda for the next number of weeks, that we do not forget those families and those communities beyond that point and that we continuously keep an eye on it because the loss and the impact of that tragedy will be felt far into the future.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.  It was lovely to see at the commemorative service the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Leader of the Opposition on the ground with the communities so soon after what had happened.  It shows the immense solidarity and support that we have for those communities and that the entire country has been impacted and affected by what happened there.<\/p> <p>I will raise another matter which is the energy costs around retrofitting.  The deep retrofit scheme was announced earlier this year.  It would be timely to have a debate in this House with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on how that is working because one of the things we could do to assist people with their energy costs is to try to help people to cut energy waste and to make their homes more efficient.<\/p> <p>I have concerns around the way the retrofit scheme has been set up.  In order to access the deep retrofit grant it is only necessary to pay the balance because a point of contact will do all the works and only charges the balance as the grant is claimed by that company.  However, to access the grant on a piecemeal basis, perhaps having the windows done first and then insulation separately to reduce expenditure, all the cost must be paid upfront and the grant is claimed back afterwards.  This seems to make it far easier for those who can afford to spend the big money on a full deep retrofit and not as easy for people trying to do it bit by bit until they get their list of works done.  We need to look at that because it has become more expensive now that the cost of materials and labour has gone through the roof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#O00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I express our sympathies regarding the ten people who lost their lives in County Donegal.

She is doing a PhD in Maynooth on disability and the impact of disability services in EU accession states.  She is also on the expert panel of the Organisation for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which is part of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  I am on the expert panel as well and it met for the first time in Poland last week.  What struck me from my engagement was the serious challenges that people with disabilities are facing in Ukraine.  We saw the bombing of Kyiv in the past 48 hours.  Let us imagine being a wheelchair user or someone who is blind and the air raid sirens go off.  In terms of reaching a shelter or somewhere else that was safe, they would be compromised even before anyone else was.<\/p> <p>What concerns me most is the fact that, of the 16 key aid agencies that are rightly getting billions of euro in funding from all over the world, only two have targeted programmes for people with disabilities in Ukraine.  That is not good enough.  As a country, we need to ensure that all of the key agencies, including the Red Cross, have dedicated programmes for providing financial support on the ground to Ukrainian organisations for persons with disabilities, which are struggling to support people.  The horrendous difficulties that persons with disabilities face in a war have regularly been discussed in the Houses.<\/p> <p>Some of the work that the panel I am a member of is doing involves examining the impact of emergency responses, particularly as they affect people with disabilities.

Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones - their families and friends - as well as the emergency services, both North and South, the community of Creeslough, the people of Donegal more widely and the county's diaspora.<\/p> <p>The colours green and gold are synonymous with Donegal in good times and in sad times.  They are, after all, the county colours.  Thinking of Creeslough in recent days, I have thought of a beautiful landscape of mountains, bogs, forests, lakes, rivers, seas and shores and, above all, of its people.

I think we were all deeply impacted by the tragic events at the weekend but also very proud of the response by the local community to what must have been a devastating and unimaginable scene to come upon.  Like Senator Boyhan, I thank, in particular, the first responders whether that was of the blue-light variety or, indeed, those in the Civil Defence in the local areas who stepped into an bhearna bhaoil so into a very dangerous and volatile situation to help in the effort in Creeslough.  It says a lot about the community that people were prepared to help in such a fashion.<\/p> <p>Support is being shown around the world, as the Leader knows, whether that is monetary support or, indeed, expressions of sympathy and that is important at a time like this.  It is so raw in the immediate aftermath for the community.  Equally, I hope, and I am confident, that through that pain and suffering these expressions of sympathy will penetrate and reach the families and the community, and give them some degree of succour.  I agree with the Deputy Leader and thought that it was important for political symbolism to have the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Leader of the Opposition on the ground so quickly.  That shows just how deeply this tragedy has impacted people right across Ireland.<\/p> <p>I do not think that I can build on the very eloquent contribution made by Senator Boyhan other than to say that County Donegal is a beautiful place.  It is beautiful because of its epic scenery and landscape.  Creeslough is a part of County Donegal that, like many, I know very well.  Its greatest asset, strength and beauty manifests in its people.  It is manifest in the people of County Donegal.  These are a people who have suffered tremendously over generations but a people who have always been resolute, united, confident, creative and talented.  That was represented in the loss of the ten people who died.  There was no better a representation of the best of County Donegal than those people themselves.<\/p> <p>Again, I extend our sympathies to the people there at this devastating time.  All of our thoughts and hearts are with them over these raw days and, crucially, in the time to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#Q00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I join with colleagues in remembering those who lost their lives in Creeslough last Friday.

I wish our women's international soccer team the very best in Hampden Park tonight.  I have watched every match the women have played in their campaign this year and attended their match against Sweden here in Dublin.  They are a credit to this country.  These young women are bringing the women's game to the fore and showing young girls what it means to put on that international jersey.  They must be credited and thanked for everything they do and we send them our best wishes.<\/p><p>However, there is another side to this story I want to raise.  Many of these young women, unfortunately, must go to England to pursue their dream of a professional career.  Some in the squad are amateurs and are still playing here in the national leagues.  As my colleague Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said this morning, it is time we looked at creating a contract through Government intervention and with the FAI so we can grow the game at local level and increase that representation at national level.  I congratulate the IRFU on recently awarding 43 international contracts to its professionals and creating a professional atmosphere for women's rugby in this country.  It is time we grew such an atmosphere in soccer through whatever initiatives we can.  It is essential we support the women's international game.  Tonight we hope to have a good news story where a women's international team qualify for the World Cup for the very first time.<\/p><p>Tomorrow during Private Members' business in the D&aacute;il my party colleagues will bring forward a motion to provide a mechanism for community workers to get a pay increase they have not received in 14 years.  We are all aware of the great work done by section 39 workers, community employment, CE, supervisors and all such workers in our communities.  It is true to say that without many of them, many of our community facilities simply would not function and many families would not have the supports they and their loved ones so badly need.  I have spoken to many people in the sector over recent days.  They consider themselves the forgotten workers of this country despite the work they do being essential.  I hope the Government will accept this motion tomorrow and that in the future we can discuss once again the great work done by all those people in all those organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#Q00400","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I would also like to be associated with the remarks expressing our sympathies to the people in Creeslough and the wider Donegal community.

However, we should look at making greater use of retired members of the force and possibly encourage them to take part in the Garda Reserve by doing a number of hours in Garda station offices and so on.  This is something Councillor Mannix Flynn on Dublin City Council has raised on a number of occasions.  We are missing out on the valuable resources many of our retired garda&iacute; could give to the reserve.<\/p> <p>Like Senator Wall, I wish our women's soccer team well.  I am glad the FIFA Women's World Cup will be held in locations that respect human rights.  There is a major concern about the fact the men's World Cup will take place in Qatar where there continues to be evidence of abuse of migrant workers, including wage abuse.  There is evidence more than 50 labourers died there in 2021.  Homophobia is rife in a country where it remains on the statute book that if you engage in same-sex sexual activity, the penalties could include death.  As for the treatment of women there, a woman in Qatar must obtain the permission of her male guardian if she wishes to marry, work in certain jobs, travel or study abroad or indeed be the primary carer for a child, even in the case of divorce.  I express the concern of this House about the FIFA World Cup or any international sporting event being held in a country where human rights are abused.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would hope that every Member of this House, if they are travelling to any of these countries, would raise human rights abuses and certainly should not praise the regime in these countries or try to minimise the deaths of migrant labourers.

It was a shameful decision.  The Amnesty International report for 2021 and research completed over the past decade confirm it was a terrible decision.  Since the award was made to Qatar over ten years ago, over 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar.  They have died building the stadiums, airport, roads, public transport system and hotels, and even a new city, which will host the World Cup final.  We are aware that migrant workers in many countries are the lowest paid and have no workers' rights.  It is particularly the case in Qatar.  The construction industry has failed to protect the 2-million-strong migrant workforce.  When we see Qatar's grim death toll revealed in the official data, it is really striking that the causes of death include falls from a height and asphyxiation due to hanging.  Deaths of undetermined cause are also listed.  The most common cause of death listed, natural death, was attributed to acute heart or respiratory failure because of the conditions in which the migrants were working.  That is before we get on to all the other human rights violations.  Therefore, it is deeply concerning to see that a Member of this House went on an all-expenses-paid trip to Qatar to try to whitewash what has happened there.  The country should never have got the World Cup.  I hope that if people watch it, they will remember the workers who died to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#S00400","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I wish to raise an issue that is quite serious and has been a scourge in recent years, namely class A drugs.

A delegation came to see me at one of my clinics in Kinsale yesterday about the Cork-to-Kinsale route.  It is a significant one used by tourists every day.  The starting point for that route has been changed, however.  Instead of starting at the bus station at Parnell Place, it is commencing from Clontarf Street.  This is about the process in this regard.  Things change, but the process is the key thing.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, comes in and it just makes changes.  There is no consultation and no mechanism whereby members of the community are asked what they think.  There is no interaction whatsoever.  The NTA is the funder and, therefore, it has the ultimate power.<\/p> <p>We have now had a bus stop moved, and no bus shelter provided, to right beside an adult shop.  Residents of a certain age are trying to get off the bus there every hour of every day.  The queues are beyond belief because the bus route is tied in with the service to the airport.  Instead of making it to Kinsale in 45 minutes, therefore, it now takes just over an hour.  When we look at how we are governing our State and at who has the power of governance, the power the NTA has now is beyond belief.

In other words, it is either the NTA&rsquo;s idea or nothing.  That is not governance or a democracy.  That is not what the people want.  <\/p><p>We need to have the Minister come in so we can ask who actually controls and runs the NTA.  Who has the power of control and audit over the NTA?

It puts everything else into perspective.  Our thoughts and prayers go to all of the families involved who are bereaved.<\/p> <p>The Leader is very familiar with the school meals programme and the hot school meals that are provided.  Indeed, in her former life, she was involved in that programme, which has gone from success to success, from about 30 schools to about 300 and some &euro;65 million spent.  <\/p> <p>We met recently with the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board regarding the school meals programme.  It too believes it a huge success, but it is concerned that there has been no review of the Department of Social Protection's maximum rate of payment in more than a decade regarding the costs of providing those school meals.  <\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, initiated a review into the programme.  Perhaps that review has not concluded or perhaps they are looking at the rates.  I think they are aware of the extra costs currently facing suppliers.  Unfortunately, we now have a situation whereby there is nobody tendering for the provision of school meals in certain areas.  I spoke to a company that had tendered previously that said that it has not tendered for this year because of the increase in costs.  The maximum rate of pay, for example, for a breakfast or snack is 60 cent for two items; for lunch, it is &euro;1.40 for one substantial item, one small item and a drink; dinner is &euro;1.90 for a hot meal and drink; and a hot meal club is &euro;2.90.  It gives examples of the food that is to be provided as well.  <\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Social Protection to see whether there will be a review of those rates.  It is a hugely successful and important programme.  We know the importance of having nutritious food and ensuring school children have breakfast, lunch and sometimes a hot meal.

It makes no sense to have the funding there if the cost per head is not sufficient for people to be able to apply for the tender.  I will certainly contact the Minister today and ask her what the story is with the review.

In addition, it transposes most of another EU directive, the better enforcement and modernisation directive.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Dara Calleary:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Bill has received significant consideration due to its complexity.  I want particularly to acknowledge the work of former Ministers, Deputies Richard Bruton and Robert Troy, during their time in this Department in developing and progressing this legislation.  The Bill has passed pre-legislative scrutiny and has come through the D&aacute;il.  I acknowledge the cross-party support for its provisions.  This speaks to its importance.  That is why I am particularly pleased to introduce the Bill to Seanad &Eacute;ireann today.  <\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to bring about several positive changes for consumers, including stronger consumer rights, protections and remedies across a number of key areas.  For instance, it gives people stronger consumer rights when it comes to how problems with goods or services are resolved.  Instead of just exchange, refund or repair, customers will also be entitled to agree a price reduction on faulty goods and flawed services.  They will also be entitled to withhold payment for goods or services that have been partially paid for if they are not satisfied with the quality of the item or service received.  Critically the Bill stipulates that any form of redress must be free of charge and must be carried out as soon as possible. <\/p><p>The Bill brings together in one statute provisions that are currently contained in diverse pieces of law and some that have never been regulated before.  In existing legislation consumers have no rights to remedies when services are not provided as expected and agreed, for example, legal services or building services.  The Consumer Rights Bill closes that gap.  It also includes new protections for consumers in regard to digital content such as audio and video files, computer games and digital services such as streaming services, cloud computing and social media.  These new digital rights include the right to a full refund, exchange or repair when a good or service is not as described nor fit for purpose.<\/p><p>Consumers will be entitled to any upgrades to the product or service that is needed to ensure that it continues to work as expected and agreed free of charge.  The Bill contains a new blacklist of contract terms and conditions that are automatically deemed to be unfair and which should not be included in any consumer contract, for example, where the agreement is only legally binding for the consumer and not the trader.  Businesses will be required to set out clearly a description of the goods or services being provided, the total price and cost of delivery before entering a contract with a consumer.<\/p><p>Furthermore the Bill gives extra enforcement powers to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, which is the body responsible for enforcing consumer law in Ireland.  These new powers mean that when traders engage in misleading and aggressive commercial practices like posting fake reviews or where they do not provide the remedies or reimbursements that consumers are entitled to, the CCPC can take action such as issuing compliance notices or applying to the Circuit Court or the High Court for a declaration or injunction.  It will also provide enforcement powers to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in regard to electronic communication services and premium rate services, and to the Central Bank with regard to financial services. <\/p><p>The date given by the European Commission for transposing these directives was July 2021 for the sale of goods directive and the digital content directive, and November 2021 for the better enforcement and modernisation directive.  Unfortunately we, along with several other member states, did not meet these deadlines.  As seen and as noted through earlier debates this Bill is a complex and highly technical piece of legislation which required significant consideration and redrafting.  The focus has been to make sure that we get it right even if that meant taking a little more time.  I am confident therefore that the Bill presented today is robust, well-considered and fit for purpose.  <\/p><p>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  This Bill contains 14 Parts and six Schedules.  It is important to point out at this juncture that with very limited exceptions Parts 2, 3 and 5 transpose maximum harmonisation directives which give little or no discretion as to their implementation. <\/p><p>Part 1 deals with matters common to legislation.  It also contains generally applying provisions relating to the making of contracts, preventing traders from attempting to restrict the rights of the consumer and the jurisdiction of the court to order remedies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Dara Calleary:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Part 2 focuses on the rights of consumers under sales contracts and on the remedies available to consumers where goods do not conform to those contracts.  It gives effect to the 2019 sale of goods directive and incorporates the provisions applying to consumer contracts under the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  It also deals with commercial guarantees.<\/p><p>Part 3 gives effect to the digital content directive on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services.  Its provisions set out the rights that apply under such contracts and the remedies that apply for the infringement of those rights.<\/p><p>Part 4 will replace the provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 that relate to service contracts.  It expands the rights of consumers in respect of such contracts and establishes a scheme of remedies that will apply where a service does not conform to those rights.<\/p><p>Part 5 re-enacts, with substantial amendment, the provisions on consumer information and cancellation rights contained in the consumer rights directive.  In addition, it repeats rights in the directive relating to payment fees, additional payments, charges for calls to consumer helplines and inertia selling.<\/p><p>Part 6 makes a number of important changes to the provisions of the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995, which transposed the unfair terms in consumer contracts directive.  It also gives effect to the new penalty provisions inserted in the directive by the better enforcement and modernisation directive.<\/p><p>Part 7 sets out the enforcement powers and penalties under the Bill.  The CCPC will have enforcement responsibilities for consumer contracts under all Parts of this legislation.  The Central Bank will continue to have an enforcement function under Part 7 and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, will have an enforcement function under Parts 5 to 7.<\/p><p>Part 8 contains the various amendments to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 that are required to ensure that the protections and remedies available to consumers in respect of the purchase of goods will be available irrespective of whether the consumer pays the price in a one-off payment or by way of instalment or other type of deferred payment.<\/p><p>Part 9 contains the various amendments to the Consumer Protection Act 2007 that are required to transpose amendments to the unfair commercial practices directive made by the better enforcement and modernisation direction.  These amendments will extend and enhance the enforcement measures available to the CCPC.<\/p><p>Parts 10 to 14 provide for a number of amendments to other enactments, such as the Central Bank Act 1942, the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 and the Companies Act 2014.<\/p><p>Schedule 1 sets out repeals and revocations.  Schedule 2 sets out the information to be provided by the trader prior to the conclusion of an on-premises contract.  Schedule 3 sets out the information to be provided by the trader prior to the conclusion of an off-premises contract or distance contract.  Schedule 4 provides the information concerning the exercise of the right to cancel and includes the model cancellation form.  Schedule 5 deals with contract terms that are presumed unfair.  Schedule 6 sets out the amendments to Acts and statutory instruments.<\/p><p>A comprehensive consolidated consumer rights Act will provide a legislative framework that is more appropriate to present-day conditions and requirements, is simpler to understand and navigate, creates clearer rules for businesses and strengthens consumer rights.  Therefore, this legislation is good news for consumers.  It is equally good news for businesses because it recognises the behaviour of responsible traders and puts them on a legislative footing.  It also ensures that regulators like the CCPC and ComReg have the powers necessary to sanction businesses that do not uphold the standards that this legislation will demand.<\/p><p>I thank everyone who has made an input to the Bill to date.  I thank the officials in my Department for the considerable work that has gone into the Bill.  I look forward to further input during this debate and I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101100002#CC00500","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665495000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I omitted to welcome the Minister of State's officials to the House.
