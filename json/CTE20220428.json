Deputies Hourigan and Verona Murphy have sent their apologies.<\/p> <p>  To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  The service requests that individuals continue to wear face coverings when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people's physical space.  The public health advice should be heeded.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament. <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with the Department of Justice and officials from the Prison Service to examine the 2020 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 24, Justice, and Vote 21, Prisons.  As per the committee's request, the Department has provided it with a copy of the independent review of voluntary mess committees in Irish prisons, which the committee may wish to examine during the engagement.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials: Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general of the Irish Prison Service; Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice; Ms Oonagh Buckley, deputy Secretary General; Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, assistant secretary; Mr. Seamus Clifford, assistant director; and Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation at the Irish Prison Service.  We are also joined by Ms Marianne Nolan, principal officer for the justice Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode. <\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege, and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are all very welcome.  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651134600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of &euro;399 million in 2020.  This was a reduction of &euro;140 million, or 26%, on the prior year.  The main reason for the reduction in the level of expenditure on the Vote was the transfer of responsibility for certain services to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth following the formation of the Government.  This included the transfer out of responsibility for the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers.  However, the processing of asylum applications remains the responsibility of the Department of Justice.<\/p> <p>  The Data Protection Commission was also established as a new Vote in 2020.  Previously, the commission was funded from the Justice Vote.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure under the justice Vote in 2020 was distributed across five programmes.  The biggest expenditure programme relates to the range of services that together address the strategic objective to \"provide a safe and secure Ireland\".  In 2020, the total spend for that programme was &euro;207 million.  This was up almost &euro;27 million, or 15%, year-on-year.  The largest component of this spending related to criminal legal aid, which totalled just over &euro;62 million in 2020.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion relating to the appropriation account for Vote 24.  However, I drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control regarding material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts that operated in 2020.<\/p> <p>  I also drew attention to the payment of an EU fine by the Department.  The fine, in the amount of &euro;2 million, was imposed due to delayed transposition by Ireland of an EU directive relating to money laundering and terrorist financing.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of Justice but is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21.  While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the Prison Service is headed operationally by its director general.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 21 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;401 million.  Around two thirds of the expenditure, totalling &euro;271 million, relates to pay.  The remainder is spread across a range of areas, including maintenance and improvements to the prison estate, equipment purchases, education and services for prisoners, and other operating costs. <\/p> <p>  Note 6.5 to the appropriation account provides an update as at September 2021 on progress made by the Prison Service in its arrangements for the operation of staff voluntary mess committees in the larger prisons.  The note outlines that governance arrangements have been reviewed and written agreements have been put in place between the committees and the Prison Service.<\/p><p>I understand that the Accounting Officer has provided further detailed information about the operation of the committees in recent correspondence.<\/p><p> I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account for Vote 21.  However, I drew attention in my report on the audit to the basis of the valuation of land at Thornton Hall.  While the land was valued by the Valuation Office at &euro;2.7 million in 2020, the Prison Service continued to carry the assets at Thornton on the statement of financial position at the historic cost of &euro;49.3 million.  This was in contrast to the valuation method applied for all other land and building assets.  In my opinion, the exceptional accounting treatment of the assets at Thornton Hall was not warranted.<\/p><p> I also drew attention to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts operating in 2020 for the supply of goods and services to the Prison Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651134600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office for their work on this.  The Chairman has introduced the team.  With his permission, I will share my time with Ms McCaffrey.<\/p> <p>  Vote 24, the justice Vote, is one of six in the Vote group and covers a wide remit of activity, both in the Department and a number of agencies in the justice sector.  In 2020, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, there were five expenditure programmes with 50 individual subheads.  The Vote structure was realigned substantially in 2021 to take account of the Department&rsquo;s major restructuring and the 2020 transfer of our integration and equality responsibilities to the expanded Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  These changes have rationalised the Vote&rsquo;s structure and reduced the number of programmes from five to two - criminal justice and civil justice.<\/p> <p>  Any review of 2020 must take account of the pandemic and, like the rest of the world, managing the impact of Covid-19 on our staff and business has been a central focus at all levels in the Department and the whole justice sector ever since, perhaps nowhere more so than in the prisons, which the director general will speak to shortly.  The management of the pandemic in the Department has been led by the management board and the Covid-19 response management group, supported by our specialist occupational health and safety unit.  This work included ensuring business continuity for the public services we provide, introducing remote working, onboarding more than 700 new staff over the past two years and safeguarding and supporting all our colleagues, including those serving abroad and those who had to remain in the workplace in front-line and public-facing roles.<\/p> <p>  Our criminal and civil governance teams communicated regularly and consistently with our 25 agencies to support them in responding dynamically and safely to the evolving public health restrictions.  It is a credit to the professionalism and commitment of the whole organisation that, working together, we succeeded in doing this and much more through the last two years.<\/p> <p>  There was also a significant impact on specific areas of the business.  The legislative teams supported colleagues in the Department of Health in drafting legislation and regulations, including the necessary Garda powers.  The restrictions on international travel and checks on people arriving into the State meant many dynamic changes for staff of the border management unit at Dublin Airport, including supporting mandatory hotel quarantine.  The pandemic impacted the provision of immigration services to our customers, necessitating the temporary extension of immigration permissions through 2020 and 2021.<\/p> <p>  Innovations were also introduced, including the first ever online citizenship ceremony in 2020 and more followed in 2021.  Under the Department&rsquo;s IT strategy, we are investing in developing much-needed digital systems, but the prolonged need to either restrict or stagger staff attendance in offices increased processing times, particularly in some high-volume immigration areas.  This situation improved as restrictions lifted and staff could return to offices.  We took the opportunity to re-engineer and streamline processes and this has been having a positive effect in recent months.<\/p> <p>  Members will appreciate that the recent essential work to welcome and process the refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine has necessitated the redeployment of experienced officials to staff the one-stop shop and reception centre.  This currently operates from 8 a.m. to approximately 4 a.m., seven days a week, at Dublin Airport, as well as at offices in Cork, Limerick and Rosslare to facilitate those arriving through other ports of entry.  This whole-of-government operation has received and processed over 25,000 people under the EU's temporary protection directive over the last two months.  The compassion and professionalism of colleagues involved is a great credit to them and reflects the response of the whole country to Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  Returning to Covid, as the country entered the first lockdown in March 2020, the Department was acutely aware of the huge difficulties and fear that restricting people&rsquo;s movement could bring to those at risk of domestic abuse.  Colleagues quickly developed and implemented an inter-agency plan, including the Still Here public awareness campaign.  This was a collaboration with front-line services in the public sector and in civil society in order to reassure victims that the practical supports they needed would still be available.  Additional financial supports were provided to front-line NGO partners and measures were put in place across the sector, including through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Operation Faoiseamh.  The Judiciary and the Courts Service also prioritised domestic abuse cases and provided for remote hearings for protection orders where necessary.  The Irish Prison Service risk-assessed those being released from prisons and the Legal Aid Board established a helpline to provide prompt legal advice and legal representation in court where needed.  The success of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s community engagement and policing strategy through the pandemic has rightly been recognised and I know the committee also recently heard from the Policing Authority about its important oversight work, which has had significant value in maintaining public trust.<\/p> <p>  There are a large number of agencies in this Vote but I want to mention in particular Forensic Science Ireland, as its long-planned, state-of-the-art laboratory HQ is nearing the final stages of construction.  I am pleased to report that despite the impact of the restrictions on construction activities in the earlier phases of the project, the lab is now on-track for completion this year within its budget of &euro;99.5 million.  This new facility will be one of the most sophisticated pieces of public infrastructure ever constructed in this country and will provide the hard-working staff of Forensic Science Ireland, with a high-spec, purpose-built facility, achieving the highest standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage.  It represents a very significant investment in our criminal justice system and the future of the Forensic Science Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to Ms McCaffrey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh McPhillips"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651134600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>As the Secretary General has outlined, it has been a truly remarkable and challenging period for communities across the globe and Covid- 19 has also had a major impact on the Irish Prison Service as we sought to keep all those who live and work in our prisons safe.  As a service, we have proven to be adaptable, flexible, resilient and highly innovative and our staff have embraced the challenges presented to us by the pandemic with professionalism and dedication.<\/p> <p>  The year 2020 saw the introduction of new and innovative methods of service delivery, including the delivery of teleservices for chaplaincy and psychology; maintaining links with family and friends virtually using video link technology; the introduction of electronic money transfer systems in partnership with An Post; and the introduction of in-cell telephones to help prisoners keep in contact with their loved ones and to support their mental health.  As a result, we were able to face down the challenges of Covid-19 and continue to provide the best possible level of service to prisoners in our care and to their families.  In early 2021, it became clear to all of us that living with Covid-19 was going to be a reality for some time.  Many of these new systems introduced in response to Covid-19 have now become essential tools for the delivery of prisoner services and for supporting prisoners, and have been permanently retained as we have moved into a less restricted environment.<\/p> <p>  Preventing the spread of infection into prisons and keeping those in our care safe did have an impact on expenditure and on the costs of providing prisoner services in 2020, with additional costs relating to the purchase of personal protective equipment for staff and prisoners, additional infection control costs, and healthcare and specialist cleaning supply costs.  This was necessary expenditure to mitigate against the risk posed by the virus and our infection control measures were central in our success in effectively managing the threat posed by Covid-19 in a prison setting.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, additional funding was provided to the Irish Prison Service under the Government economic stimulus package.  This allowed for a number of important projects to be advanced, such as building roof repairs, CCTV and security system upgrades, nationwide carbon reduction LED lighting replacement and upgrades to fire alarms.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges presented by Covid-19 since 2020, the Irish Prison Service has continued to deliver on the strategic actions set out in our current strategic plan, including our programme of prison modernisation.  Despite the impact on the construction sector due to the closure of construction sites at certain times, significant progress was made during 2020 on the capital development project at Limerick Prison.  Work on the project has continued in 2021 and 2022 and the project remains within budget and is expected to be completed later this year.  The project will provide quality accommodation for prisoners and enhanced services, and will provide an additional 90 male prison spaces and 22 additional female prison spaces.<\/p> <p>  Over the lifetime of our strategy, we have continued to implement a programme of reform within our service.  We continue to work closely with our key stakeholders to enhance the supports available for prisoners, including supporting prisoners on their transition from prison back into their communities.  As we emerge from this global pandemic, work is now turning to the development of a new strategic plan for our service through which we will build on recent reforms and take account of our experiences and learning from the past two years.<\/p> <p>  I can go into further detail as the members require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1651134600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The money was primarily spent to address prisoner hardship, on prisoner programmes and to support our community return and community support programmes.  I was of the view that selling items in the tuck shop as an economic activity was not really what the Prison Service is about.  It is a service to prisoners.  We have changed the manner in which our tuck shops operate and, instead of selling at recommended retail prices, we now sell products at cost plus 5%.  The programmes that were previously supported by that fund now receive Exchequer funding.

I think prisons did an incredible job, especially in the first wave, of protecting prisoners and staff in overcrowded congregated settings from what could have been an absolute catastrophe.  It came at a significant price, however, and there is an opportunity to learn from that.  It is clear from going through all the reports of the Inspector of Prisons that prisoners reported very significant information about how not to get Covid but much less information about what to do if they had it and how that was to be managed.  There was a significant mental health impact from the isolation that was necessary, especially in the first wave, including the missing of family visits.  There is an opportunity there.<\/p> <p>  I would like to refer to the staff survey that was done in 2021 by the Office of the Inspector of Prisons.  The staff recommended in-cell telephones and video calls to improve relationships with family members and to improve mental health.  This would have obvious benefits for education and training and access to mental health supports, which is a big problem irrespective of Covid.  That recommendation came from the staff.  Sometimes one is criticised for providing services to prisoners, but this is a staff recommendation.  I want to amplify it from the staff survey.<\/p> <p>  There is an ongoing concern about the mental health impact of the current quarantine experience.  Ms McPhillips is aware of that but I want to flag it to her because it will come back.  These things can come back in many different ways from a cost perspective to the State.  In terms of the directions that were possible under the Act, it was July 2021 before a direction was given.  However, the sunset side of things is not clear with regard to unlocking and unwinding the restrictions on exercise and so on.  Ms McPhillips is aware of that also but these are the difficulties.<\/p> <p>  We spoke in great detail about D&oacute;chas at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, but the overcrowding in D&oacute;chas and the refurbishment that is necessary are very significant.  There is an ongoing problem about the profile of people there with overwhelming addiction, mental health and welfare issues, many of whom should not be there but need to be in supported facilities.  I am not sure where the Department is moving and whether sufficient departmental priority is being given to being able to move to that.  We have gone through it in detail at the justice committee but I just wanted to highlight it here again.<\/p> <p>  Deputies have talked about the cost to the State of the slopping-out cases.  It was &euro;1.5 million in compensation and another &euro;500,000 in legal costs for in-cell sanitation for 2020 and 2019.  It comes with the overcrowding problem.  In the Inspector of Prisons report on Arbour Hill, one can see the effect of a doubled-up bunk being in a single cell with a toilet, with no screen between the toilet and the lower bunk.  Prisoners report trying to use the toilet on the landing for each other's dignity.  These are ongoing very visible and obvious problems that have to be addressed, especially where there are not separate sanitation options.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the priority areas under the regime management plan, RMP, there will be work on training as an essential service.  That will be prioritised.<\/p> <p>  I want to leave prisons for a second.  The money laundering directive came from the EU in 2015.

First, I have a brief question.  In 2020, an issue under the remit of the Department of Justice that came to my attention is funding for the coroner's court.  I understand there has been some difficulty with the discharge of bodies, particularly in areas where there is high population.  Outside of Dublin and other areas of the country this is the remit of the local authorities, but it is the remit of the Department of Justice as it pertains to Dublin.  What measures has the Department been undertaking to deal with that issue in the context, of course, of it being a deeply personal issue for many people?  In Ireland we have an important tradition where the death and funeral process is very swift in comparison to what might be the case in the United Kingdom where it takes weeks.  It is quite important from a cultural standpoint.  I will open with that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#R02300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651134600,"counter":495,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.  Something we were very conscious of at the beginning of the pandemic was the potential and the great unknown about how this would all play out.  We established a dedicated team in March-April 2020 in respect of coroners and the pathology services generally.  Obviously, the Office of the State Pathologist is under the Department.  The pathologists in hospitals are under the HSE, so there can be quite a complicated provision there.  I will ask Ms Buckley to comment on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#R02400","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh McPhillips"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651134600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>There are challenges around this and they became particularly difficult during the pandemic because of the Covid-19 precautions that had to be brought to bear.  Dublin also became the recipient of a lot of bodies where Covid-19 precautions had to take place so it took a bigger hit nationally, if I can put it that way, which was really unfortunate.  As the Deputy said, one is always conscious of the families involved.  One thing involved here is that Covid-19 deaths are natural deaths so unless there was another reason for a post-mortem they would not necessarily have undergone that.<\/p> <p>  The other issue with this, and the Secretary General has mentioned this a few times, is that there are very specialist skills associated with doing post-mortems and so forth.  It is constantly a challenge to recruit and have those skills in place to facilitate the mortuary service.  The other issue is that some hospitals offer the service and depending on whether the hospitals are in a position to offer the service, that can increase or decrease the pressure on the Dublin mortuary.  We had quite a significant issue in the last few weeks where a couple of hospitals had to stand down, for reasons pertaining to themselves, and the mortuary then took the hit.  At one point, we were up to a delay of two weeks in post-mortems.  I am pleased to tell the Deputy that as of yesterday, when I was briefed on the matter, we had only nine post-mortems outstanding.  Effectively, there is currently no backlog of post-mortems in the Dublin mortuary.<\/p> <p>  We have a specialist unit now that is concentrating on the coronial service and the mortuary service.  A feature of the justice plan for this year is that we intend to look at the overall structure of the system to see how it needs to be structured for the future.  Our coronial service was last properly overhauled in 1846, so we probably need to have a look at it.  That is very much in our plans for the future.  However, at the same time, I have a dedicated and excellent team working on making sure that the current service is maintained and supporting the Dublin coroner, who is independent, in doing her important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#R02500","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1651134600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Excellent.

As part of our briefing and with regard to the State Claims Agency, there are approximately 2,400 claims outstanding in respect court cases being brought against the Irish Prison Service.  Am I right that approximately &euro;3.1 million was paid out in compensation in respect of claims by prisoners in 2020 and there was &euro;1.5 million in compensation and &euro;500,000 in legal costs awarded in respect of in-cell sanitation cases between 2019 and 2020?<\/p><p>To me, that sounds a little unusual.

There was a case that went as far as the Supreme Court in regard to the lack of in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison.  That case was allowed on appeal and damages in the sum of &euro;7,500 were awarded.  The legal costs involved in that case were very significant.  The State Claims Agency manages these claims on behalf of the Prison Service.  In February 2020, the State Claims Agency put in place a specific scheme to address the number of claims that had been made in this respect.  To give an update on the figures, as of now 2,773 claims have been received, of which 2,040 have been concluded, so there has been very good progress in respect of that scheme.  An important point to note in regard to the scheme is that damages have been capped at a maximum of &euro;7,500.  There are three different categories or levels of compensation depending on whether a person was on a restricted regime and sharing a cell, on an open regime and sharing a cell or in their own cell.  Importantly, the legal costs have also been capped and that relates to the level of award that is granted.  The maximum legal costs that will be paid in respect of a claim is &euro;1,700 and the minimum for compensation awards at the lower end of the scheme is &euro;1,000.<\/p> <p>  It has been a very successful scheme.  Certainly, if we look at the legal costs that were attached to the original case that was litigated in the courts, the expenditure is far less than that.  The State Claims Agency at the beginning of the process in regard to in-cell sanitation claims put a contingent liability of &euro;37.7 million against the claims.  Now, because of the success of the scheme, it looks like the liability to the State will be in the order of &euro;15 million.  Therefore, the scheme that has been put in place has been very successful.  There has been good engagement with both plaintiffs and their solicitors and the expectation is that that scheme will be concluded, hopefully, before the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1651134600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>It is good to at least have certainty in regard to where all of that is going but &euro;15 million is a very large amount of money and I have to say this cannot be accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#S00300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651134600,"counter":505,"content":"<p>A point to make is that there has been massive investment in the prison estate to bring it up to standard.

I am hearing about a lot of usage by teenagers and this has been reported to me through my constituency office.  This is extremely concerning.<\/p> <p>  I want to put on record that this is something we need to try to get some degree of control over.  I do not wish to put across the position that this can be eliminated and, obviously, it cannot be.  However, it is the case, unfortunately, that drug use is rampant in Ireland, particularly among younger members of society.  While that is a topic of much debate, when it comes to more serious drugs it is a huge concern.  The Department has to try to find more useful ways and, instead of trying to put people in prison, to try to guide young people away from substance abuse and drug use.  It needs to find more proactive ways of getting people off the streets and away from dealing drugs.  That is very important.  We need to re-evaluate this through education programmes, rather than the stick approach, which, unfortunately, is not working.<\/p> <p>  Garda&iacute; are under immense pressure and finding it very difficult to deal with gang-related crime, which has been an issue in Ireland over a long number of years.  I want to make the point to the Department, the Secretary General, the assistant secretary general and all of the officials here that we have a lot of work to do to prevent people from ending up in prison and in situations of addiction.  Unfortunately, from what I have seen and what I have heard through my office, this is a huge problem that is going to have huge knock-on consequences for people's mental health and the growth and development of young people in Ireland in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022042800002#S00500","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651134600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I would endorse that absolutely.

Regarding the car, I think what was applied for was a car allowance, which, effectively, would be a payment made to the chief executive as part of his or her salary, and there would be benefit-in-kind taxation of the allowance, but that was declined.  What was agreed was that a company car would be provided, presumably on the basis that this person would be travelling around to racecourses and so on.  That was that aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  NewERA is part of the NTMA and has a specific focus to advise Departments on commercial State bodies and issues that arise in that regard.  Its role, therefore, was to examine the case that was made regarding the salary and to express a view on it.

The example given was the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  Anybody filling that post will attract that salary.  It was not a salary determination for an individual.  Similarly, here, it was, I think, the lower salary scale that was originally approved in, let us say, 2012 or whatever.  It was never applied.

That is very clear in its correspondence.

To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the Houses of the Oireachtas Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or in close proximity and to adhere to public health advice.<\/p> <p>  Today's meeting is an engagement with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, to discuss the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality related to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV.  I sincerely welcome the Minister.  She is participating via Teams from her Leinster House office, where she is accompanied by Mr. Ben Ryan, assistant secretary in the Department of Justice.  We are grateful to them for their engagement on this important module and this important part of our work.  <\/p> <p>  I will read the note on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee but if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to particular matter, and they continue to do so, witnesses are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  They are directed that only evidence that is connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  <\/p> <p>  I now call the Minister to make her opening statement.  We are delighted to have her here with us.  We have already had a number of hearings on the recommendations of the citizens&rsquo; assembly.  We see our role as a committee to prepare an action plan for the implementation of those recommendations.  We are grateful to the Minister for her engagement with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022042800002#B00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and committee for giving me opportunity to join them this morning to discuss the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, in particular, regarding domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I thank them for their support and commitment on this issue.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairperson, Dr. Catherine Day, and other members of the assembly for their dedication to, and hard work on, this topic.  I welcome the Citizens' Assembly's examination of these critical areas of life and policy.  As the committee members will be aware, this is an area of work on which I, as well as my colleagues in government, have identified as a priority.  We welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in advancing these recommendations.  It should be underlined that the majority of the recommendations are very much aligned to work that is being carried out across Departments and in particular, by my own Department.  Any recommendations that are not already captured by our ongoing work will, of course, be considered on their own merits.<\/p> <p>  Some of the work aligned to the recommendations made by the assembly includes the audit of how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is segmented across different Government agencies, which was published in July of last year.  As well as this, there is the development of the third national strategy to address domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which I will submit to Government in the coming weeks.  There is also the review of the provision of accommodation for victims of domestic violence, which was undertaken by Tusla and was published in February.  It took into consideration both the needs of victims and the types of accommodation that is required.<\/p> <p>  In addition, as part of the implementation of Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, my plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence, we worked with our NGO partners and others to map the journey faced by individual victims to identify issues and support needs not met.  Following this, my Department conducted a review of the grant schemes application to identify and address any gaps in services.  On the foot of the outcome of this work, I provided additional funding of &euro;445,000 to organisations in 2021 to fill the gaps that were identified.  The mapping exercise identified situations in which there are parallel civil and criminal proceedings, and possibly child protection proceedings, as having the potential to further traumatise victims and to give opportunities for perpetrators to seek to exercise coercive control.  My Department is working with key NGOs to identify practical solutions based on international best practice to address these issues.<\/p> <p>  Work is under way to develop specific training for all of the key personnel, including those in the legal profession, with whom a victim may come into contact during their journey throughout the criminal justice system.  The introduction of preliminary trial hearings will reduce delay and allow for sensitive legal issues to be dealt with before the trial starts.  In March, my Department held its inaugural victims&rsquo; forum for State, social and community groups.  Findings from these forums will assist my Department, and indeed other Departments, in developing further supports for victims. <\/p> <p>  Improving the system for victims, particularly for vulnerable victims, is a key priority for me and for my Department.  As part of the reforms being introduced under Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, the victim will be entitled to their own dedicated legal advice and support throughout the process.  The major reforms we are driving will collectively ensure we have a criminal justice system that places victims at its centre and that removes the fear many victims have in coming forward to report what happened to them.  This should be a system that supports, informs and empowers vulnerable victims at every point.  I appreciate that that is not the case at the moment.  That is what we are striving to achieve. <\/p> <p>   I am also currently leading work on a new whole-of-government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which will further advance the recommendations made by the assembly.  This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention, as well as on ensuring that victims are better supported.  It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in our society for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. <\/p> <p>  A number of the objectives in the new national strategy are in line with the assembly's recommendations.  The first of these is to ensure the availability of accessible, quality specialist and community-based domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services across the State, so that all people who experience domestic, sexual or gender-based violence have access to integrated services, no matter where they live.  Another objective is to ensure a victim and survivor-centred wraparound service through the creation of a clear, integrated local pathway.  This builds on the mapping of the victim and survivor journey work we have done.  It is for adults and for children, both female and male, victims and survivors to access the domestic violence and sexual violence information services and various different supports.  The strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals that we set.<\/p> <p>  I am finalising the strategy for submission to Government in light of the public and sectoral consultations that formed part its development.  I am also working on finalising an accompanying action plan for the rest of this year and next year, which will set out how each of the arms and aims of the strategy will be achieved, which Departments and agencies are responsible for them and the timeframe for delivery, so that it is targeted, ambitious and deliverable.  I intend to bring both the finalised strategy and the action plan to Government in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, it is my goal that everyone who needs a refuge space will get one.  I am deeply committed to working with partners in the sector and with Government colleagues to achieve that.  I acknowledge that this is also a key recommendation. <\/p> <p>  In February, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and I published the review by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  The review highlights gaps in geographical coverage and inadequate provisions for safe accommodation.  It provides a list of priority areas where additional services would address the most immediate need.  I fully acknowledge the need to dramatically increase the provision of refuges across the country.  Key to this will be ensuring that organisations can access the funding that they need.  To this end, I have established a high-level interdepartmental group to review the current system for the provision of refuge space and accommodation and to identify changes that can be made to deliver additional spaces as effectively and as quickly as possible.  The timelines for delivery of refuge places, as well as further targets for national and nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation, will be outlined in the third national strategy.  Further detail will be contained in the accompanying action plan.  <\/p> <p>  Committee members may also be aware that the Government will, for the first time, establish in law a national agency whose task will be responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The agency will be responsible for overseeing all of the actions set out in the third national strategy for delivering domestic violence services.<\/p><p>It will bring together the expertise that exists within my Department and Tusla and will report to me and to any other subsequent Minister for Justice.  Bringing the responsibility for policy and service delivery together under one Ministry, establishing the agency in law, and introducing oversight from the Department of the Taoiseach demonstrate our recognition of the need to have a dedicated and expert-focused approach to this work.  It demonstrates our commitment to work together to reach our goal of zero tolerance and to ensure the coherent delivery of the best possible DSGBV services and supports throughout the country.<\/p><p> I want to emphasise that I am committed to the challenge of preventing and responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I acknowledge that while we have achieved a lot in this area, much work still needs to be done.  Zero tolerance of all forms of DSGBV is an ambitious but necessary goal and by continuing to work together I am confident we can achieve that.  I very much look forward to continuing to work with the committee to progress the recommendations of the assembly.  I again thank the members for having me before the committee this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022042800002#B00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that very clear opening statement.

It is very much appreciated.  I hope she has had an opportunity to follow some of the work this committee has been doing in recent months.  The committee has a short timeframe and we are very much focused on ensuring that what came out of the citizens' assembly is translated into actions for citizens.<\/p> <p>  I commend the Minister's statement, in particular the commitment to recognise and acknowledge those historic and current gaps in supports and services for survivors of DSGBV.  That is critical.  It is very important that she had it in her opening statement and I recognise that.  I want to focus on a couple of different areas of the third strategy.  Delivery of any plan is contingent on effective implementation, which is also then reliant on adequate budget allocations from the Government.  Could the Minister confirm if the action plan to follow the publication of the third strategy will be published before the summer recess?  Will she and her Department be the accountable body in respect of the implementation of the action plan?  I ask this in light of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality, which was to have oversight of DSGBV; however, it seems to meet quite sporadically, perhaps twice in 2020 and once in 2021.  I recognise the role Covid in that scenario, but the committee has met only once so far this year.  Is that likely to change with the new responsibility of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence?<\/p> <p>  How will regular reporting on the performance be measured?  Has the Minister given consideration to publishing a quarterly or biannual performance indicator, similar to what the Garda does in its monthly report to the Policing Authority?  Will she make it available?  This is most important.  Publicly available information on performance indicators is a key tool to demonstrate not just the commitment but delivery, transparency and accountability.  It could play a very positive role when it comes to our efforts to halt DSGBV.  Significant commitments have been made around the fourth pillar and I do not think any of us would be straying from the truth if we say there has never really been effective policy co-ordination and implementation at national and local level.  I understand this is a big ask, but reporting could go some way to addressing concerns.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also acknowledged in her opening statement that there is a requirement for significant current and capital expenditure.  The current annual budget allocated to DSGBV is quite small.  Figures provided by Departments in January of this year put the figure in or around &euro;40 million.  That is quite a low level of funding, given the task in hand.  Has the Department costed in full the third strategy and will a budget for its implementation be sought by the Minister when the strategy is submitted to the Cabinet?  She mentioned that would happen in the coming weeks.  It is key for survivors and advocates that Government commitments are backed up with clear budget lines and costing, not just on an annual basis but for the lifetime of the plan.<\/p> <p>  I wish to touch briefly on refuges and the services provided.  This is an anomaly that has never sat easy with me or most of the service providers with whom I engage on a regular basis.  I refer to the fact that there is no dedicated capital expenditure budget in any Department to provide safe accommodation for survivors of domestic violence, DV.  We understand that the capital funding for approved housing bodies and Cl&uacute;id services to provide refuge accommodation is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but the current position is that the primary responsibility for the provision of refuge places is with Tusla.  The primary purpose of the homeless current expenditure is for those who cannot provide accommodation from their own means, not specifically for victims of domestic and gender-based violence.  We recognise that capital assistance scheme, CAS, funding is available to approved housing bodies, but there seems to be a lack of any proactive measures from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deliver accommodation specifically for victims of domestic and gender-based violence.<\/p> <p>  The Minister acknowledged that we do not meet our obligations under the Istanbul Convention to provide adequate accommodation and wrap-around supports.  Tusla provides just one third of the refuge spaces that we are obliged to have under the convention.  Nine counties have no DV refuge places at all.  My county of Longford has no DV accommodation provider.  The Minister mentioned the report by her and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We need to substantially increase the number of refuge places given the current needs, projected needs and international obligations.  Who is responsible for the delivery of the 60 units?  There is a growing concern that this identified immediate need will not be progressed until the DSGBV State agency is established.  That would be wholly unacceptable given that it has been established as a current need.  Has the budget been secured for the 60 additional units?  What is the timeframe for delivery of them and will they include the wrap-around supports and services?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the service providers on the ground currently, it appears there is an over-reliance on communities and people's generosity in terms of fundraising to meet the resource needs of applying to multiple State agencies for different streams of funding.  That was very much exposed during Covid.  Because there is no multi-annual funding in place, it makes planning for these services incredibly difficult.  We really lag behind international norms on this issue.  I fail to see how a proper service level agreement that is fit for purpose could not include multi-annual funding.  What progress has been made to rectify this?  Will funding for operational costs be streamlined so that these services are not applying to multiple Departments for multiple sources of funding?<\/p> <p>  We recently heard from AkiDwA, which gave rather compelling evidence on the issues that face migrant women who experience domestic violence and abuse.  One of the issues they raised passionately is the limited value of allowing a woman to remain in Ireland on a stamp 3 visa, where she is unable to financially support herself or her children.  Why is the provision to obtain a stamp 4 visa, with permission to work, through ministerial consent, not included in the INIS domestic violence guidelines?  We need to have very clear pathways for protection, support and care for these migrant women who are reliant on our immigration system.  That seems to be lacking at the moment.  Does the Minister believe the third strategy adequately provides and protects migrant women and immigrant victims of DSGBV?<\/p><p>Does the third strategy include a national action plan to address female genital mutilation, FGM, in Ireland?  If not, why not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022042800002#C00300","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":660,"content":"<p>There is a quite a lot of stuff there.

This will absolutely be published before the summer recess.  I appreciate the intention was to publish it this month but we want to ensure we get a number of elements right.  The change for the provision of services from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to my Department has meant we have had a particular focus on that work and ensuring there is enough done on the development of new refuge accommodation for inclusion in the strategy.  It is a really important element of the strategy.<\/p><p>I also took a decision to have a final consultation, knowing it would probably delay the publication of the strategy.  This was important as we have consulted with people, organisations and representative groups.  We have worked side by side with them for the past year and half.  That has slightly delayed things but I can confirm that it will be published before the summer recess.  It will be published in a matter of weeks.<\/p><p>There are a number of layers in the structures we have in place with respect to accountability.  The Deputy mentioned the Cabinet committee on social affairs.  Currently, the Department of Justice - that is me and my team - will oversee the implementation of the strategy but it is a whole-of-government strategy.  The agency working with the Department will oversee the implementation when it is set up.  The Cabinet committee on social affairs will meet on a regular basis but we do not have to tie down particular dates.  It will be meeting more regularly than it does now.  There is a separate structure involving the Secretaries General from the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department, who will meet to ensure the information needed for the Cabinet committee can be provided and there is time for the Departments to be engaged.  There are quite a number of sides involved but the day-to-day implementation will be through the Department and agency.<\/p><p>There will be continuous work to develop the agency and measures will be put in place to ensure continuous engagement with front-line workers and the community and relevant sectors.  We are already engaging with them and we are looking to identify the best way to establish the agency within the critical path was set out by the various different players and things that need to happen over the next 18 months.  Everything will be done in consultation and that will continue when the strategy is launched.  If something is not happening or working, we will get the feedback from the sector and those working on the ground.  That will be very helpful.  This is the first time we have co-designed our strategy with the sector and I hope that process has been very beneficial for both sides.<\/p><p>On reporting, the intention is to report on a half-year basis.  We need to allow time for work to progress and things to happen.  As there is a level of engagement and structure built into the agency, there will always be that engagement with the sector and those working on the ground.  We will set out clearly the budget not just for this and next year but for the lifetime of the strategy.  That will include not only my Department but other Departments and their actions.  Quite a number of actions will not require any additional funding within a budget but there will clearly be funding required that would be new money.  Of course, with regard to current spending for the delivery of services, funding will increase, and there will be capital spending on refuges and accommodation.  We have already set out figures as to how much it will cost to deliver in the short, medium and long term throughout the strategy.<\/p><p>With regard to refuges, accommodation and related services, the intention is there will be wrap-around support for services connected with refuge and accommodation.  I appreciate that to date there has not been <i>per se<\/i>, a dedicated DSGBV capital fund and instead it has come through the capital assistance programme.  That means it is very much a bottom-up approach in that agencies, individuals, community groups and local authorities must go to the scheme and Tusla, and it is quite a difficult and lengthy process.  If there is no agency on the ground or particular group that is willing to drive the process, or if there are just other challenges preventing it from happening, this can be a very difficult process.  The interdepartmental group I mentioned has been established, and it comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as Tusla.  We are currently looking at the structure and how it can improved so it is not just a bottom-up approach.  There must be potential, if the State must intervene, for there to be a more proactive approach in that regard.<\/p><p>We are already engaging with various different refuges on the ground working on new projects.  We are getting information from them on what is working and not, and we are sharing best practice.  That will help us deliver best practice in capital delivery.  It is the same as when we build schools, we have a template and we know what works or is best practice.  We want something similar here so that every refuge is not just about physical beds and the accommodation that people need but the wrap-around supports, services and environment that must come with that.  We are looking beyond that in terms of other supports people might need separate to the refuge.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has said publicly that the capital assistance scheme and his Department will support funding to develop those other ancillary supports and not just the accommodation piece.<\/p><p>I am very conscious there are nine counties where there are no refuges.  I was in the Deputy's county recently and met representatives of the local women's network.  I know there is fantastic work happening on the ground and we must harness those efforts in working with organisations to see how we can deliver new accommodation as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>On the question of who is responsible, we are working with Tusla and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to sign off on a memorandum of understanding, MOU.  Once that is signed, my Department and I as the Minister will be responsible for the delivery of services working directly with Tusla.  That means there will be no gap.  Currently the work is happening, as it normally does, between Tusla and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Once the MOU is signed, the responsibility will transfer to my Department.  Once the agency is established, that will take over in that regard.  I assure people there will be no gap.<\/p><p>There was a question on timelines and this takes in the short, medium and long term.  People might see a couple of months as the short term but irrespective of how much we can tidy the process, shorten it and improve it, it takes time to develop and build any time of accommodation and ensure services and supports are correct and fit or appropriate for what we need.  In the short term we will be able to set ourselves target over the next two years for what we will deliver in the lifetime of the strategy, which is five years.  The longer-term plan is for ten years.  That is the way it has been set out the Tusla accommodation review to ensure we can meet our Istanbul Convention requirements.<\/p><p>We agree that funding must be increased for service providers and that is what we are working on.  That is to ensure we are not just getting increased funding every year to match the increase in accommodation but that we are looking at increasing support for those people already there and the work already happening to allow those services to expand.  In many counties where we have accommodation, it must expand as well.  It is not just about new accommodation but expanding the services that are there, which will require additional current funding.  We are looking at all those figures, which will be set out in the strategy when it is launched.<\/p><p>On the question of migrant women, there is a particular focus on ensuring that those who are most vulnerable have access to supports and information and they are supported in the best way possible.  That is why we have engaged with many of the organisations and they have been key in providing the type of information we need to ensure this strategy is adequate and it protects immigrant and migrant women.  That includes looking at our immigration system and ensuring that information is provided in the right language.  It means working with the organisations that are closest to those communities.<\/p><p>On the question of female genital mutilation, one of the requests was that this would allow anybody to seek international protection.  It already falls under &quot;gender&quot; as a reason to be able to seek international protection.<\/p><p>That is a UN term that captures quite a number of different things.  Certainly, if somebody has been a victim of FGM, she is currently legally entitled to seek international protection.  There will be further work done, through the Department of Health, on the strategy on this particular issue as well.  I think that I have touched on most issues but I am happy to come back in if I missed something. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022042800002#D00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response, which is much appreciated.

We have not reached a point where I can say that we have the overall figure but we are close.<\/p> <p>  The MOU will apply to accommodation and not just the delivery of service, all of which will move over to my Department and then the agency will have specific responsibility.  That is an important element because it will work closely with the sector.  This is not about replacing the invaluable organisations that work on the ground; this is about supporting them, learning from them and then using all of that information to be targeted and focused.  As the Deputy has outlined, this should not be about where there is a group on the ground and capability to be able to apply.  Organisations will have the capability and no accommodation but at the same time it is a very difficult process and we have to look for it.<\/p> <p>  What we are trying to make sure, through the work that we are doing in the interdepartmental group, that will then be taken over and implemented through the agency, is that it is looking at need, population and assessing goals and objectives.  The approach is everyone who needs a refuge space will get one and to date, unfortunately, that has not been the case.  We have fantastic accommodation and fantastic people work in this sector but we need to fill the gaps.  We also need it to be a little more-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022042800002#E00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651100400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":666,"content":"<p>We are already linking in with managers and people who work in refuge spaces and learning from them in terms of other refuges and conditions.

I thank the Minister for her very substantive response.<\/p> <p>  I have follow-up questions and will focus on specific recommendations that the Citizens' Assembly made on this topic.  Again, I thank the Minister for her engagement and acknowledge her personal commitment.<\/p> <p>  I also acknowledge that recommendation 37, under the DSGBV heading, has been met, which we will acknowledge in our report.  No. 37 states: \"All Government action to prevent and counter domestic, sexual and gender-based violence should be coordinated by a Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility for implementation of a national strategy.\"  The Minister has clearly set out that she is that \"Cabinet Minister\", not will be, and that this principle is being implemented in the transfer of responsibilities entirely to the Department of Justice, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>  We, as members of the committee, are conscious that the murder of Ashling Murphy put an immense focus on the gaps in service provision for the victims and survivors of DSGBV.  We are glad that the aim to have a zero tolerance of DSGBV in society has been included in the draft national strategy, which we welcome.  I am also glad, as Chairperson, and along with committee members, to see that the draft national strategy is aligned with the important recommendations made by the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of issues that I have with specific recommendations, and that arise from the hearings that we have already had and the previous exchange with Deputy Clarke.  First, we are glad to hear that the new national strategy will be published before the summer recess and, indeed, in a matter of weeks.  I was glad to hear about the action plan.  Will the action plan be published alongside the strategy?  I think that the Minister said that both will go to Government together so we could anticipate that they will be published together.  That will be important because we need to see the timeline in the action plan and that will inform our own work on the committee.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 38 states: \"Eliminate tolerance in our society of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence by developing and implementing awareness, prevention and education campaigns\" and I am conscious that is somewhat beyond the traditional remit of the Department of Justice.  Given the Minister is committed to the establishment a new agency, which is also welcome, will it have a remit to implement or oversee the implementation of an \"awareness, prevention and education campaigns\"?  Next week, the committee will engage with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris.  We will examine these campaigns and their roll-out at third level, and in future weeks we will look at their roll-out across the education sector.  Again, just looking at the need for co-ordination, which underlies the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, the draft strategy and, indeed, the fourth pillar of the Istanbul Convention, which is policy co-ordination, will the agency have that remit?<\/p> <p>  I welcome that a statutory agency will be established as it will help with the implementation of the recommendations.  Is there a timeline for its introduction given primary legislation will be required?<\/p> <p>  Under recommendation 39(e), the assembly called for the \"Putting in place a Victims\/Survivors Commissioner as an independent advocate and voice for victims\/survivors\".   Is there a plan to put in place a commissioner for victims and survivors separately or as part of the remit of the new agency?  I am conscious that the Minister mentioned the very welcome introduction of an entitlement for victims to their own dedicated legal advice and support throughout the process and that provision may meet the need that was identified by the assembly.  The broader issue of \"a Victims\/Survivors Commissioner\" was raised by the assembly.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 39 also set out a number of points concerning the justice system, and specifically the courts system.  At previous committee hearings NGOs expressed serious concerns about a lack of co-ordination, in particular, between criminal and family court processes.  This is something that I have heard about for a long time.<\/p><p>Any of us who have met survivors have heard for so long about real frustration and distress.  Real damage has been caused in some cases to children, for example where family courts dealing with custody and guardianship issues do not have information on parallel criminal proceedings around domestic violence, breaches of protection orders and so on.  How can we ensure that co-ordination is better carried out?  Will that be the remit of the new agency?  What measures are being taken now in advance of the establishment of the agency?<\/p><p> A related issue also addressed in the citizens' assembly is the way in which counselling and medical records and the victim's character are addressed in courtroom settings.  The assembly has called for guidelines and specialist training for judges and lawyers, which the Minister addressed in her opening statement.  At the hearings we heard real concern from NGOs that the new provisions around admission of counselling records in the 2017 Act are still not really addressing victims' needs and concerns and are still enabling defence counsel to undermine the victim's character.<\/p><p> I am sorry, I have gone over time.  I have two more questions.  One is on coercive control.  We heard there was concern about a lack of understanding among criminal law practitioners and prosecution and policing authorities about how to police and prevent coercive control.  Finally, on recommendation 42, which the Citizens' Assembly put forward under a different heading, Gender Equality Principle in Law and Policy, the assembly called for a statutory body for gender equality under the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister charged with cross-Government co-ordination of gender equality issues.  We flagged with the Minister that we would ask her about that even though it is beyond the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Does the Government have any plans for a broader statutory body for gender equality and broader co-ordination on gender equality issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022042800002#E00800","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>On the vast majority of the recommendations, work is already in train or will be included in the strategy, which is really positive.  The Chairman mentioned the completion of the first one in respect of a dedicated Minister, the agency and better co-ordinated structures that we are putting in place that I mentioned previously.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the agency itself, the timeline we have set out is 18 months.  There is potential for the time to be shorter or for it to be longer, but I would hope it will not take longer.  That is based on the time it has taken for previous agencies to go through the initial phase of passing the legislation, establishment and everything else.  We have a critical path, as I mentioned, that my Department has set out, looking at all the actions that need to happen.  We have already started that work.  We have started engagement with the sector to make sure the structures that are in place are correct.  The critical path will be included in the strategy so we will be able to see how things are progressing.<\/p> <p>  The remit is not just the delivery of service and refuge accommodation but will also include responsibility for the delivery of national campaigns.  The latest strategy had a particular focus on national campaigns.  It was split into two segments over six years and we had various campaigns around the themes \"What would you do?\" and \"No excuses\", which only finished up last year.  The intention for the new strategy is that there will be more focused campaigns and education pieces within our schools.  We are working closely with the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley, on that piece.  We are also already working with higher education institutions and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.  He is working on a consent campaign and a national consent hub with NUI Galway.  From that, a wider national campaign on consent will follow.  That will happen before the agency is in place but anything subsequent in terms of campaigns will be delivered through the agency.  <\/p> <p>  The agency will also be responsible for gathering information.  That is something I think we are missing when it comes to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, having enough information to be able to develop our policy.  Much of it comes from the sector, which is amazing, but it is important that we have very clear and defined information and that we are collecting it on a regular basis.  The agency will be tasked with that.<\/p> <p>  The commissioner is not something we have on our agenda in terms of actions.  What I have tried through Supporting A Victim's Journey is to identify and map the journey a typical person may go on as they go through the criminal justice system.  We have been working with the sector, those who are on the front line and who engage with victims, and we have been speaking directly to victims, to identify gaps in the system and where we need to expand our support or provide additional funding.<\/p> <p>  Separate to that, we established a national victims' forum, which met for the first time approximately two months ago.  It is not specific to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence but a vast majority of the organisations that are engaged with the forum deal with this issue.  The intention is that there will be an opportunity for different committees and working groups on topics that people want to work on to make sure victims' voices are heard and that information feeds in.  It is something I am very open to exploring or looking at further if it is felt that a specific commissioner or a particular role within the agency is needed.  I am willing to look at that further to see if there is something more we need to do there.  The whole point of this is that the victim is at the very centre so their voice has to be heard at every stage.<\/p> <p>  On coercive control, and in any new laws that we pass, it is so important that the Garda, the legal professions, judges, and anybody else including those in the health sector are aware of this, know the laws, are up to speed and can pass that information on to their client or to victims and survivors.  A number of strands of work are happening in that regard under Supporting a Victim's Journey.  Education was a key priority for Tom O'Malley in his original report and subsequently in Supporting a Victim's Journey.  We have had training start with the Judiciary.  We have had court settings where there was specific training around domestic and sexual violence.  The intention as more judges are trained is that they would be able to train and engage with colleagues further so that we have a larger number of people who are specifically trained within the judicial system.  Similarly when it comes to our solicitors and barristers we have been engaged with the Law Society and Bar Council for almost two years now on this, identifying the education they are providing through their own structures and how we can improve it.  We are also doing a mapping exercise, similar to Supporting a Victim's Journey, to see where education is being provided across the various areas and how we can fill any gaps and where there needs to be improvement.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I appreciate that for the past couple of years it has been difficult to provide the in-person training, which is absolutely vital in respect of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The Commissioner has given a commitment that in-person training will start again this year specifically for those in the divisional protective services units, DPSUs.  We would like to see in-person training expanded as part of the general training, in which it is included at the moment, and that it would happen on a regular basis to make sure that when we have new laws, such as those on coercive control, Coco's law or the forthcoming provisions on stalking and non-fatal strangulation, people are aware of them and victims benefit from that understanding.<\/p> <p>  Family and civil justice is something I am very conscious of.  One of the first people I spoke to coming in to the Department, a victim, explained that it was a massively difficult issue for her.  There are two elements to this.  The family justice oversight group has been looking at the family justice structures within the legal system.  It will be publishing an overall strategy for family law accompanied by the family courts Bill, which is going to develop family court hubs.  There will be a particular focus in that strategy, as well as the domestic violence strategy, on how we can bridge that gap where there are civil and criminal proceedings happening at the same time, and how we can make sure that people are not re-traumatised and that there is sharing and crossover of information where possible.  It will be encompassed in two different strategies, which are being worked on at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The medical records issue is very much part of Supporting a Victim's Journey.  We have been working with the Department of Health.  One of the key elements is making sure that victims know they can object to their records being presented in court.  That is often not known.  A body of work is being done to look at how it currently happens and what better mechanisms we can put in place to protect victims.  There is work ongoing on that and there will be further detail in the strategy.<\/p> <p>  There is no plan within my own Department to have a specific agency.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has appeared before the committee and he said the same.  He gave a commitment to write back to the committee.  While responsibility for gender equality used to be with the Department of Justice, it has now moved to his Department and he would be best placed to develop such an agency if that were to happen.  Of course, it would have my full and absolute support and that of my Department if that route were be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022042800002#F00200","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her very comprehensive response.

How can we step up mediation and collaborative law while also ensuring that people are not forced into compulsory mediation?  When it comes to gender-based violence, it is important that people are free to go to the courts and are not forced to endure a longer period before exiting something that may be quite harmful to them.  I know that the National Women's Council has asked that we do not have mandatory mediation.

We have spoken at length about the need for refuge places and the need for those pathways, hubs and other supports.  I want to look at specifically in this instance where the safest place for the survivor is in the family home.  Yesterday afternoon SPARK and One Family made a presentation in the audiovisual room at which a deeply concerning issue was raised that I was not aware of.  Where a barring order has been put in place because of domestic violence and the abusing partner pays the mortgage on the property, that is assessed as means for the purposes of social welfare.  Phenomenal steps were taken during the Covid pandemic relating to rent supplement where the survivor of domestic violence needed to seek alternative accommodation.  In this situation there seems to be a very real discrepancy that is resulting in survivors and their children being further traumatised because if that is taken in as means, it results in reduced social welfare payments and increased levels of poverty.  The outlook for the family is much more challenging than it could be if this was simply looked at again.<\/p><p>We are in a position to provide payment, and rightly so, to those who flee the family home because of domestic violence but there does not seem to be the same corresponding level of support for those who are in a position to stay in the family home and the perpetrator of the abuse leaves.

We have received apologies from Deputies Higgins and Niamh Smyth.<\/p><p>Before we start, I have a few comments to make.  This committee has been tasked with examining the issues surrounding international surrogacy, in particular the rights, interests and welfare of the children born through international surrogacy, the rights, interests and welfare of surrogate mothers, the rights, interests and obligations of intending parents in future international surrogacy arrangements, and the rights, interests and obligations of intending parents of existing children who have already been born through international surrogacy.  Nobody in this room or looking in this morning online would understate the challenge of the task that we have been set as a committee.  The issue of international surrogacy is legally complex.  It is a socially complex and emotionally complex issue.  There are many strongly held views about this topic and I believe that each of us has much to learn about the issue in general.<\/p><p>Our task as a committee is especially challenging because we have only three months in which to complete it.  However, I believe that, as parliamentarians, we are privileged to be in a position to undertake this task and to grapple with an issue that many other countries have failed to address, but with that privilege comes a responsibility.  Not only do we have a responsibility to thoroughly examine the issue, we have a responsibility to deal with this issue in a respectful manner.  I would ask members to be mindful of the fact that many of the witnesses who we have invited in as a committee have been on very difficult and long journeys to get to this point.  I ask, therefore, that our questioning be done in a respectful way and without causing hurt.  I also ask that members treat each other with respect.  I will not stand over name-calling or religious references in the chamber.  I will also not allow, due to statutory prohibition, the discussion of matters in a public forum that arose from private meetings.  I remind members that, as Cathaoirleach, I am the sole judge of order, that is, whether it is me, as Chair, or someone acting in the role of Chair.

In research that I conducted with LGBT Ireland in 2021, 53% of the LGBTQI+ parent families captured by the research were not fully recognised under Irish law, which means that both parents were not recognised as legal parents.  Similarly, in more than half of the families the two parents were not recognised as joint legal guardians of their children.  The research indicates that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which regulates the area of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, embraces a variety of new and non-traditional\u00a0family forms.  However, many other families fall outside of its parentage provisions.  This leads to a situation where legal recognition of family relationships in LGBTQI+ parent families is dependent on the mode of conception of the child, which is how the child was conceived, and as a result many families cannot secure full legal recognition.<\/p> <p>  In my research, 13% of total respondents to the survey indicated that one or more of their children were born through surrogacy.  All of these respondents were male and parenting with their male partner.  Due to the absence of surrogacy legislation, only one of the fathers was legally recognised as a parent in each family.<\/p> <p>  In my research, no female couple reported that they had engaged in surrogacy but it is likely that some female couples engage in this process.  Instead, in my research, DAHR was the most common pathway to parentage among female couples.  However, in only 50% of families were both of the parents legally recognised.  This was due to the fact that a number of DAHR approaches are omitted from the 2015 Act. Perhaps of most relevance to this committee is the omission of DAHR that is undertaken abroad.  If the procedure takes place outside of the State, the parentage provisions in the 2015 Act do not apply and instead parentage is allocated in the same way as any other conception.  This also occurs where the child is conceived by DAHR in an Irish fertility clinic but born outside of the State.  Other pathways that are omitted from the 2015 Act are non-clinical DAHR procedures and retrospective procedures where a known donor was used.  Given that this committee will examine the question of retrospective recognition of parentage in surrogacy, it will be important to ensure that any legislative response is consistent with the DAHR legislation.  This will require amendments to the 2015 Act because at present children born through some DAHR methods are legally disadvantaged based on their method of conception when compared with other children born through DAHR.  Also, many children of LGBTQI+ parents are legally disadvantaged when compared with the children of married opposite-sex couples.<\/p> <p>  In international surrogacy, the issues experienced by same-sex couples are broadly similar to those experienced by opposite-sex couples.  However, same-sex couples have more limited options in terms of where they can access international surrogacy as some foreign jurisdictions are only open to married opposite-sex couples.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Ireland cannot regulate surrogacy that is undertaken abroad and it cannot control the ethical or human rights framework that is adopted in another jurisdiction.  It can control the recognition or establishment of legal parentage for the purpose of Irish law.  In doing so, the key question should be whether the law and practice in the country where the surrogacy took place provides ethical safeguards that are at least equivalent to those provided in domestic law but not necessarily identical to the Irish framework. <\/p> <p>  There are a number of provisions of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 that are problematic in their current form and I have detailed some of the issues in my accompanying briefing document.  While some of these issues are more relevant in the context of domestic surrogacy, it is necessary to consider these as it seems likely, based on the experience of other jurisdictions, that an overly restrictive or poorly defined domestic framework for surrogacy will deter intending parents from engaging in the domestic process and instead encourage them to engage in international surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  To accommodate the diversity of families that exist in Ireland in 2022 there is a need to think about different ways to conceptualise family relationships.  In surrogacy, the law should avoid an overly rigid approach in its regulation of family relationships.  The must remain flexible to ensure that the best interests of the child can be assessed and secured on an individualised basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lydia Bracken"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Bracken for her contribution and invite Mr. Kenny Moore to make his opening statement.

First, the organisation was created to give gay men who were interested in becoming parents, or those who are parents already, the opportunity to exchange ideas, information, experiences and build friendships.  Second, the options for Irish based gay male couples who wish to have a child through surrogacy are very limited.  Typically, our members become parents through gestational surrogacy in the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  What is life like for a gay male parent?  Personally, I do not feel that there is one difference in how we parent compared with any other family.  Like all parents, the well-being of our children is everything.  My husband, S&eacute;amus, and I literally build the plan for each day around our three children who are called Mary, Se&aacute;n and Anne.  We put their needs and wants at the centre of everything that we do.  We think of our children as the three most special people on this planet.  They are considerate, kind and vibrant little people who carry giddy smiles and have imaginations that can turn any object into the most advanced aeroplane or doll's house.<\/p> <p>  Socially, Ireland is a great country in which to live as a gay dad.  When S&eacute;amus and I bring our children to the local shopping centre or park people often approach us to say hello.  Our experience of such encounters has been 100% positive.  We have never encountered inappropriate questions, rude comments, labelling or stereotyping.  That is not just a Dublin thing.  I grew up along the border of Tipperary and Offaly and I will never forget the night of our first visit home following the birth of our children, Se&aacute;n and Mary.  We sat at my sister's kitchen table and we were surrounded by family, friends and neighbours, many of whom are quite elderly, and each of them with presents, knitted goods and food.  All of them were there to celebrate the arrival of our two babies.  I believe that this goodwill that we enjoy is not unique to me or my family.  Let us remember that when the constitutional convention was called to discuss the idea of giving Irish citizens an opportunity to vote on same-sex marriage, an additional vote was taken on changing the laws around parenting to equally include the children of gay and lesbian families.<\/p><p>Eighty-one of the 100 delegates present that day voted in support of this motion.  The Irish people are very surprised to learn, when we explain it, that the legislation families like us need has yet to be passed.<\/p><p> As I outlined last week, this lack of legislation affects our ability to parent and protect our children in many areas such as accessing education, welfare supports, medical treatment etc.  We have outlined these issues in detail within our written submission. Therefore, I will not revisit them today.  The above issues, however, pale into insignificance when it is considered what might happen to a child, if his or her biological and legal father were to pass away.  Can the committee members imagine being in this situation, as the surviving non-recognised parent?  You have just lost your husband and now you have to spend time focusing on how you are going to keep custody of your children.  While, of course, that thought does not guide me in my everyday life, it does sometimes come into my mind.  When that happens, I just freeze.<\/p><p> I would like to highlight the core elements of the surrogacy model for which Irish Gay Dads advocate.  These elements include, first, ensuring all children are treated equally in the eyes of the Irish law, regardless of the method of their conception, pregnancy or birth.  Second, we focus on prioritising the well-being of surrogate mothers. We want to ensure they are provided with access to independent medical, legal and psychological supports before making any decisions to proceed, while ensuring their bodily autonomy at all times.  Third, we want to ensure children born through surrogacy have access to information regarding their genetic and gestational origins.  Fourth, we need to ensure the intended parents are treated equally by providing pre-birth determination in relation to parental rights.  Finally, we wish the State to provide retrospective legal recognition of the children who have already born through international surrogacy.   We feel this is Ireland&rsquo;s opportunity to be a world leader, to recognise the diverse and evolving nature of modern families, and to legislate appropriately.  I ask the committee members to please use the positions they have been given to act on behalf of the parents, families and surrogates we represent and all those same-sex female couples who have thus far been omitted from the Children and Family Relationships Act.  I thank the committee members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I am delighted to attend this morning&rsquo;s committee meeting.  It is an honour and privilege to have the opportunity to speak with the committee today on behalf of Irish Gay Dads.  I sit here with the committee today quite literally as a result of modern family planning, for I myself was born by IVF.  In fact, I was one of the first children in Ireland to be born via IVF.  Growing up, I and my brother knew how wanted we were and the struggles faced by our parents to conceive.  Our mother would routinely tell us how, in her mind, her life really only began when she had children.  After nearly ten years of failed pregnancies, miscarriages and near death, my parents welcomed me into this world.  Therefore, as we celebrate 35 years since the first treatment took place in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, marking the beginning of the creation of tens of thousands of families throughout the country, I feel it quite apt to be speaking to the committee today as we debate the need to legislate the next progressive steps in Irish family planning.<\/p> <p>  My husband, Carlos, and I met some 12 years ago, and from day one we discussed our desire to have a family.  In 2015, the same-sex marriage referendum created the first opportunity for our relationship to be formally recognised in Irish society and for us to be considered a family unit under Irish law.  We married in 2018, thus creating the first foundation of our family.  Since then, we have moved to create a life that could support our ambition to grow our family.  It is an innate human desire to want to have a family, to raise a child and to create a higher meaning in one&rsquo;s life.  This innate desire does not go away.  It is not selective to only some people but to us all, no matter our fertility, physical ability or sexuality.<\/p> <p>  Article 41 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann sets out that it is my fundamental right as an Irish citizen and as a married person to make my own decisions when undertaking matters in relation to family planning.  If marriage is the foundation to our family in our legal system, how can the same legal system not support the growth of my family?  Without legislation to enable me to create a family, I am in a dichotomy of paying to be part of an Irish society that does not allow me to reap the benefits of same.  How is it right that, in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners, I am equal, the same as my friends and neighbours, but when it comes to my fundamental right to grow my family, I am prohibited?<\/p> <p>  Irish relationships and families are no longer being created in the traditional chronological order of yesterday, when one would meet someone, marry, buy a home and create a family.  Men and women are meeting later in life and coupling later.  More and more women are entering the workforce and focusing on their careers, as is their right.  The new chronological order of creating a family is multifaceted.  Thus, we are only going to see an increasing number of the population looking to assisted human reproduction, AHR, solutions in creating families.  This includes international surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  The AHR Bill is, in my opinion, the single greatest advancement in Irish family planning since the creation of the State.  It would be a travesty not to include international surrogacy in this historic Bill.  I implore the committee to take action to make sure the vast majority of families created via surrogacy are not left behind and are not left to be second-class citizens in their own country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for coming in and telling their stories.

I have specific questions for each of them, so I will go into that.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Bracken has published extensively in this area and I am a proud owner of two of her books.  I have two points to raise with her, the first of which is the position of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, decision, particularly the one in France.  In that regard, it is an advisory opinion.  What is its standing in the Irish context?  Is it open to this committee to recommend that we ban international surrogacy because of the commercial element to it or is it open to this committee not to provide a pathway for parental recognition of the second parent?  Is a second parent in this State entitled now to take a case against Ireland on the basis of the failure to create that legal parental relationship?  Is that open to a person in this State to take that case against Ireland?  My personal contention would be that the failure to implement a framework is akin to burying our heads in the sand.<\/p> <p>  The second issue concerns parentage order versus guardianship.  On some of the sanctions, we have talked with Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony about a carrot-and-stick approach and trying to get people to engage in domestic surrogacy and to incentivise that, but that international surrogacy will occur.  In that, there may be implied issues or difficulties.  One of the issues that hang over us is that we would not award parentage orders in a situation where maybe all of the boxes are not ticked.  Instead, it would be mere guardianship.  However, the point of parental orders is that they are akin to adoption and so sever the obligations and duties on the person who gave birth as surrogate mother in these instances.  Therefore, if we merely employ guardianship, then we have the difficulty that she remains with all of those obligations in Irish law.  Does Dr. Bracken have any suggestions or thoughts of what would be a sanction or a penalisation on that?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kenny Moore and Mr. Lennon are very welcome.  I am very grateful for their extremely valuable experience and their sharing with us the failure of the Legislature.<\/p><p>It would be shameful if we continued to fail families formed via surrogacy.<\/p><p> A significant point from Mr. Kenny Moore last week and Mr. Lennon today comes from their sharing of the fact that when gay couples meet, they have the same conversations as everybody else about whether they will have children together.  I am not sure that everybody considers how that innate desire to have a child is not dependent on sexuality or gender but it is about wanting to nurture.  It is something in the human spirit that wants to do that.<\/p><p> Last week, Mr. Kenny Moore spoke extensively about the pre-pregnancy position and depths into which the Canadian system goes.  This relates to the due diligence and high standards employed and the submission is extensive.  Point No. 4 goes into evaluating destinations, providers, clinics and agencies and ensuring consent, so perhaps he could elaborate on that.  I will hold off on other questions until the second round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#C00400","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  She asked about the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR.  The case law from the European Court of Human Rights is primarily Mennesson <i>v<\/i>. France, which essentially established that where there is a genetic relationship between an intending father and the child and where that father is also listed on the foreign birth certificate as the legal father, an obligation arises to legally recognise that relationship on the basis that it would be a violation of the child's right to private life if it was not recognised within domestic law.  That kind of set the initial standard for what types of relationships need to be recognised.<br\/><br\/>It was followed in 2019 by an advisory opinion on gestational surrogacy, which again was issued to France in a case concerning the same Mennesson family.  Although the father was recognised in the case, the intended mother had not been recognised initially at least.  The question was whether that relationship also needed to be recognised.  The advisory opinion set out that in order to vindicate the rights of the children, the relationship between the children and the intending mother, where she is listed on the birth certificate in a position where she is married to the intending father, who has already been recognised for the purpose of domestic law, another duty of recognition arises based on consideration of the rights of the child.<br\/><br\/>The status of the advisory opinion is that it is not binding and it is an optional mechanism that states can enter into in getting guidance and advice in how the ECHR case law might operate.  However, I have published on this and given the opinion that it establishes the standards that the court would adhere to.  If a case was to be brought against Ireland on this matter, it is quite likely, based on the standards set in the advisory opinion, that we would be found lacking because we do not currently have a mechanism that would recognise the relationship between an intending mother and the child in the way the advisory opinion requires us to do.  Something like guardianship does not meet the standard because it is not a permanent relationship and it does not have the same status as that of legal parentage.  On the question of whether we could ever prohibit surrogacy, we could not do that based on the jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights because we have the obligation to recognise certain parent-child relationships in order to vindicate the rights of children.  I hope that answers the question on ECHR case law.<br\/><br\/>The Senator mentioned parental orders and guardianship and referred to &quot;sanctions&quot;.  It is probably not the most accurate description of what it would be.  It would essentially be the fallback position if parentage cannot be recognised for whatever reason.  In the proposal I have put forward in the briefing document provided to the committee, I have suggested that we should ultimately get to a position whereby parentage established on a foreign birth certificate would be recognised in Ireland, whether it is by way of a parental order being recognised or some other, possibly administrative, mechanism to recognise that parentage unless it is fundamentally contrary to Irish public policy.  When we are determining what public policy means in the context of surrogacy, we need to establish an ethical framework for surrogacy within Ireland and we would determine any cases by reference to that or if it would be in the best interests of the child to deny that recognition.<br\/><br\/>If parentage cannot be established for whatever reason, we must put in place a mechanism that does not penalise the child.  Allowing guardianship to be awarded at least accommodates the child's rights in that regard.  Based on ECHR case law, a genetic relationship would need to be recognised regardless of whether the procedure falls outside the agreed ethical framework.  We must consider the child's rights in that regard.  Ultimately, in a particular case the decision must come down to what is in the best interests of the child and whether guardianship or parentage would be most suitable in that regard.  That is what I see as the kind of fallback position.  It really takes a case-by-case or individualised approach to ensure the best interests of each individual child are being maintained within the process.  I hope that answers the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lydia Bracken"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Although we have gone over the allotted time, I will allow Mr. Kenny Moore and Mr. Lennon to respond.

The Senator spoke about evaluating a destination and as a gay man, there are not many destinations available to me.  The United Kingdom is one and there is also the United States of America and Canada.  I have chosen to look at Canada for several reasons.  I wanted to align to the guidelines issued by the Department of Justice to people undertaking international surrogacy.  I am also considering the welfare of a surrogate mother, ourselves and the child who will be created.  It is important to understand all those elements.  There are also legal entities available there.  In the Canadian example, every step of the process is legalised and managed by registered third parties, whether they are IVF clinics or agency staff taking care of surrogate mothers.  The rights of everyone are very clearly stated from beginning to the end.  It is why we are talking to the committee today because that is what everyone wants.  Nobody wants to work in a grey space and the easiest way for us to have a child is still very complicated.  Normal people are doing this.  They do not have legal minds or backgrounds and they may not have a medical background.  They just want to be a parent.<\/p> <p>  One of the main aspects I have considered is ensuring the surrogate mother has, I suppose, means to live outside any reimbursement made to her.  The whole process should be welfare-focused and everybody should be taken care of, getting independent legal and psychological advice, with emotional support available throughout.  That is the only way I would feel comfortable about doing anything.  It is about protecting the surrogate mother, who is giving an enormous gift in doing what she does.  The reward is never financial for anyone.  A surrogate mother might do this because she knows people who have gone through IVF or fertility issues.  Her heart is in the right place for doing it.<\/p> <p>  These are some of the key pieces.  It is helpful for the surrogate mothers to know that because of the surrounding legislation, they would not be obliged to have any kind of legal relationship with the child.  They do not want to have that.  The intending parents, which are me and my husband in my case, want that obligation and legal process in place for us.  We want to be legally recognised, having both that gift and the obligation.

The surrogate mother, if the application is made before the declaration of parentage has been applied for by the father in the Irish courts, will also have to sign the passport application.  That causes significant complexity.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Lennon alluded to, surrogate mothers in our experience enter these agreements and arrangements with full consent.  They know exactly what they are being asked to do by the intended parents and what they wish to do for them.  They do not want to be the mother of these children or to have legal responsibility for them.  They want that to be applied to the intended parents.  When they are asked to sign passport documents, it often causes them anxiety because it suddenly seems the State is coming back to them to say they are the mothers.<\/p> <p>  When the application is made here for an Irish passport, it has to come from the biological dad.  If the declaration of parentage has not gone through the court system, which is often the case because it can take a long time, the surrogate mother will be required to co-sign that application.  She will be contacted by the Passport Office in order to verify that she has signed the application.  She is the second applicant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":710,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have any other questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#E00500","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":711,"content":"<p>No.  I am happy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#E00600","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":712,"content":"<p>We will try to see whether Senator McGreehan is back online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#E00700","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I think she is at another meeting.

Chapter 6 of this book examines the allocation of parentage in cases of surrogacy.  The chapter seeks to identify a way to regulate surrogacy that adheres to the best interests principle and balances the interests and needs of all stakeholders in the process.  It is suggested that the intention-based model of surrogacy which is facilitated through a pre-conception allocation of parenting satisfies the requirement of the best interests principle.  Will Dr. Bracken explain that to us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#E01000","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":716,"content":"<p>The Senator's question was on the pre-conception model of parentage and why I believe that is the most appropriate way forward.  Chapter 6 of the book the Senator mentioned focuses on domestic surrogacy.  I support a pre-conception allocation of parentage in the context of domestic surrogacy.  However, in the context of international surrogacy, a post-birth transfer of parentage is probably most appropriate.  I can talk about that later if that is of interest.<\/p> <p>  The pre-conception approach to domestic surrogacy is the best way forward because it balances the rights of everyone.  A post-birth transfer of parentage in a domestic context means that when a child is born, the intending parents do not have the legal rights and responsibilities that they need to care for the child, despite the fact that they will take physical care of the child very soon after the birth.  Instead, typically, the surrogate mother is regarded as the legal mother upon the birth of the child which means she has the rights and responsibilities for making all of the decisions for that child until the time a parental order is made.  This is the proposed way that parentage would be transferred in the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.  It means that if the child needs medical treatment very soon after birth, the surrogate would probably need to consent to that rather than the intending parents.  That can place the surrogate in the very uncomfortable position of having to make this kind of legal decision on behalf of the child.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 proposed there would be a transfer of guardianship to the intending parents by way of a statutory declaration with the surrogate after the birth of the child.  That can alleviate some of those difficulties but it seems there would still be a delay in terms of the intending parents getting the legal rights and responsibilities they need to undertake the caring role.<\/p> <p>  It also creates difficulties for the surrogate by being regarded as the legal parent.  Perhaps it places her in a vulnerable position.<\/p><p>Under the 2017 general scheme, it was possible for either a surrogate or the intending parents to make the application for the parental order, which would ultimately transfer parentage to the intending parents.  Under the 2022 Bill, only the intending parents can make that application, which is unusual because in the rare situation where the intending parents fail to make the application, the surrogate seems to have no recourse other than placing the child for adoption.  For all those reasons, a model that allocates parental responsibilities based on the intentions of everyone involved, which is that the intended parents will raise the child, and having that become effective at the time the child is born balances the rights of everyone in the way I mentioned.  It ensures the child is legally integrated into their family from the moment of birth, that the intending parents have all the legal tools they need to undertake the caring role and that, at a time when they are busy caring for their newborn baby, they do not have to go back to court in order to facilitate the transfer of parentage.  In that way it balances the rights of all participants, in the domestic context at least.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lydia Bracken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Bracken agree with the principle of the proposed AHR regulatory authority or some State organisation?

He heard my statement last week and, unfortunately, a lot of exploitation goes on in this road to parenthood.  How can we regulate against bad actors?

In relation to my comments last week on the birth cert, in our case the surrogate mother is listed on our children's birth certs.  That is because they were born on the UK where parental rights cannot be transferred until after the child is born and, therefore, the surrogate is legally obliged to be placed on the birth cert.  As a couple who had children through the UK, we could not go through the parental order process that exists there.  In order to do so, you have to be a resident, passport holder, citizen, etc. and we were none of those.  That is the primary reason the surrogate is listed on the birth cert.  Going forward, we ask members to consider that when surrogacy is the method of conception, the standard birth cert issued to the child would list the intended parents but that, if you wish to include the surrogate, it could be done through the long form of the birth cert, so the child can see clearly the method of conception and gestation.<\/p> <p>  I note the Senator's point about the level of exploitation.  We all agree that legislation is the way to prevent exploitation.  I dispute that it is extensive.  I do not believe that to be the case.  We in Irish Gay Dads work primarily through the United States, Canada and the UK, where the surrogacy model is extremely well established and has been in existence for over 30 years.  Natalie Gamble, a legal expert from the UK, was before this committee two weeks ago talking about the fact she has handled 1,500 cases and come across about three or four that caused issues.<\/p> <p>  I dispute that the level of exploitation is extensive but I will address the point on bad actors.  All of us, when we dream of having a child, want that child's birth story to be as perfect as possible.  We want every party to the agreement to be acknowledged, included and protected.  As I mentioned last week, no matter how much you regulate medicine or any sector, there will always be bad actors.  All you can do is put together a stringent framework to ensure that every party enters into the agreement freely, gives consent and gets appropriate legal support and appropriate independent medical support, and that every party, including the intended parents, the egg donor and the surrogate, gets psychological support so there is no doubt in anybody's mind about what is about to happen, how it will happen or what the process will look like.<\/p> <p>  There has to be, as the Senator touched on in her questions to Dr. Bracken, an oversight body that regulates all the players.  It would be the AHRA in Ireland and equivalent bodies in other locations.  Anybody who participates in a surrogacy agreement, whether a clinic, a legal person or a medical person, has to be regulated and approved by that body.  They are the safeguards.  Not legislating will increase the possibility for bad actors; legislating is the way to lock it down to the maximum extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":722,"content":"<p>What does Mr. Lennon consider that the ethical safeguards might be for a surrogate mother?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#F00600","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":723,"content":"<p>The ethical safeguards for the surrogate mother are that there is total legal counsel from the start to the end of the journey; that she has independent counsel, including psychological counsel; that all the agencies involved - and there are surrogacy agencies to take care of the surrogate mother in many countries, such as Canada - have the surrogate mother's interest as the primary interest and the intended parent is second to the surrogate mother throughout the journey; and that the surrogate mother has total control of her own body and pregnancy throughout the pregnancy, including the decision to terminate.

In the research I undertook with LGBT Ireland last year we were looking at the structure of LGBTQI+ parent families and their routes to legal recognition.  The families that were recognised, where there were two legal parents, had gone through a route to parentage that is recognised under the 2015 Act.  Essentially, there are two main ways in which that can happen.  If a family has their child after the commencement of the Act on 4 May 2020, there is a pathway to parentage that allows for two parents - they could be the opposite sex or the same sex - to be jointly recognised as legal parents provided they have used a fertility clinic within Ireland and all of the relevant consents and declarations and so on have been given.  Provided they meet all of those criteria, on the birth of the child both of the parents are legally recognised as parents as per their preconception intention.<br\/><br\/>There is another primary route to parentage that recognises the retrospective parentage for children who were conceived prior to the commencement of the legislation, that is, before 4 May 2020.  There is a retrospective route available to some families if they had their child before 4 May 2020 and they meet various other criteria, one of which is where a gamete donor was used who was unknown and remains unknown to the families.  In order to get that retrospective recognition of parentage the family cannot have used a known donor.  If families meet the criteria, they can be recognised and some 50% of families were recognised.  Unfortunately, many other families fell outside of the criteria for various reasons, one of which being that they had used a known donor.  Having prioritised their child's right to identity, they cannot achieve retrospective recognition.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned, the legislation does not cover DAHR that is undertaken abroad, even if the child is subsequently born in Ireland, or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  If the parent had DAHR treatment in Ireland and the child was born in another country, that again falls outside of the recognition.  Those are the main ways in which families fall outside of the legislation.  Also, if the family did not use a fertility clinic, they would fall outside of the legislation.  That might be referred to as a non-clinical procedure or an at-home procedure.  If the family had their child through that form of DAHR, they are not covered by the legislation either.  Those are the primary omissions in respect of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lydia Bracken"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. Lennon and Mr. Kenny Moore.   Dr. Bracken spoke about the incredible amalgamation of different pathways to becoming mammies and daddies.  It varies from couple to couple, country to country, person to person and case to case.  How best can the State help the witnesses, as parents, to become parents and move through the ethical surrogacy we want?  We all want the best-case scenario, as Dr. Bracken outlined, and that identity.  Parents who opt to have that identity known are almost being penalised for doing so.  Should we extend the regulatory authority to become an information service?  Is there a best-case information service in any other jurisdiction?  Is there somewhere we can look to?  What kind of information would be most beneficial for intending parents, such as the witnesses, who are on that pathway to international surrogacy?<\/p> <p>  I also have a general question with regard to the pathway and the lack of recognition prior to birth.

Right now, there is information there for people to understand.  For anyone going through this process, it does not matter if we regulate it to the nth degree.  It will always be slightly complicated, simply because there are so many parties involved.  It is not just about two people.  It is important to have a go-to source of information, whether that is the Department of Health or Citizens Information, that is very clear about what is the green pathway to surrogacy, domestically or internationally.  Perhaps the regulator should be a point of reference rather than people having to email or call it to ask these questions.  Citizens Information would be a great source for everyone to have that.  It very clearly sets out the different steps because it really is a multi-step process.  IVF is at the core of it and it was brilliant to be able to talk about this today.

For context, we represent parents who have had children through three locations, namely, the United States, Canada and the UK.  In the United States and Canada, because of the presence of legislation, as soon as the child has been born the intended parents are considered the legal parents, whether they are an opposite-sex couple or a same-sex couple.  That means they have the right, within the hospital setting, to make all decisions regarding the welfare of the child, such as what postnatal checks can be done, what blood tests can be carried out and so on.<\/p> <p>  In the UK, the situation is the same as in Ireland.  The woman who gives birth is the legal mother and, therefore, she has to make all those decisions.  That is the experience we had, whereby our children were born in the UK.  I might talk a little about the emotional side of that and how it all feels.  For the surrogate mother in our case, and for most surrogate mothers, it is a pretty difficult stage.  They will have just given birth and will be recovering from that, they will have intended that the intended parents would be the parents of the child, and they will then be drawn into a process where they will have to make decisions about the child and how he or she will be treated in hospital.  Even if those decisions are very standard ones, such as whether a vitamin K injection can be given or whether a blood sample can be taken, it still puts the surrogate mother in a position in which she never wanted to be.  Imagine how complicated it then gets if the child has additional needs and needs to stay in hospital for a period.  Potentially, the surrogate mother, even though she might be ready to go home, would be forced to stay in the hospital to be present with the child and to meet the legal obligations.  That is not right for the surrogate mother.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, having been in that situation, it deflates your bubble somewhat.  You will be on this incredible high, as anybody who has experienced the arrival of one's child will know, and now you are being sidestepped.  The nurses and doctors will be very busy and might say they cannot really talk to anyone except the surrogate mother, who can give that consent.  It does not feel good.  We knew all this in advance, having taken legal advice before we went to the UK so we knew what we were signing up for, but nonetheless, when it happens, it impacts on you and on how you feel about your position as a parent.  One of my colleagues from Irish Families Through Surrogacy mentioned at last week's meeting that she felt like a bit of an actor sometimes as a parent.  What I have described is a prime example of how you can made to feel like an actor.<\/p> <p>  As for what the State can do when you get back to Ireland in order to help you feel recognised, it can make the process as accessible as possible, that is, making the declaration of parentage as accessible and quick as possible and allowing for it to apply to both parents, not just the genetic one.  As Mr. Lennon mentioned, it could be that certain locations and providers would be put on a green list, and if the process looks as though it has taken place properly and there are affidavits to declare that, perhaps the process could be short-circuited to allow the declaration of parentage to be proceed much faster than it currently does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their attendance and their presentations.

Many children living in Ireland have been born through surrogacy and their family relationships are not recognised at present.  They are left in the really undesirable position of not having a permanent legal relationship with both of their parents, so that absolutely needs to be addressed.  I have proposed a model similar to that in sections 20 to 22, inclusive, of the Children and Family Relationships Act, which allows for retrospective declarations of parentage to be made in cases of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, that were undertaken prior to the commencement of the legislation.  Something similar in the case of necessary adoptions could be used successfully in the context of children who have been born through surrogacy.  That would allow the intending parents to apply to court for this declaration of parentage to recognise either of the intending parents, or perhaps both of them, who are not at that point recognised as legal parents, provided certain proofs are given to the court.  This appears to be a relatively straightforward process in the context of DAHR, so I would argue it should also be a very simple process for surrogacy in respect of surrogacy that has already taken place.  As we have the model for it within sections 20 to 22, inclusive, of the Children and Family Relationships Act, that is the model I would propose for the retrospective recognition of parentage.<\/p> <p>  As for the pre-birth or post-birth recognition of parentage, I draw a distinction between domestic surrogacy, which can be facilitated through the pre-conception approach, and international surrogacy, for which a post-birth approval process makes sense, simply on the basis it would be difficult for the State to sanction in advance parentage that has been established through a procedure undertaken abroad.  That is not to say it could not happen, and perhaps an application during the pregnancy would be possible, but the post-birth transfer of parentage in international surrogacy would allow the Irish courts to check that certain ethical safeguards have been adhered to throughout the pregnancy, up to the birth of the child.  It is not a perfect system by any means, given it means that when the child has been born, for the purposes of Irish law he or she may not have that legal recognition in respect of the relationship with the intending parents.  Nevertheless, what I have proposed is that where the intending parents have both been listed on the foreign birth certificate, we might have something of a fast-track application process in Ireland, whereby they could obtain a parental order recognising both of them as legal parents, and the application would be granted unless it were fundamentally contrary to an agreed ethical framework for surrogacy within Ireland.  Having a post-birth judicial process would allow for scrutiny of the ethical standards to ensure we maintain the integrity of the ethical framework and ensure that recognition is based on it.  Moreover, it would allow for consideration of the best interests of the child in that process.  That is primarily why I believe a post-birth process in regard to the international arrangement would be the more appropriate way forward but in the case of domestic surrogacy, I would support a pre-conception transfer of parentage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lydia Bracken"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Bracken.

Those solicitors will be better placed to give the Deputy more insight than I could.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the long form of the birth certificate, the Deputy asks a good question.  What happens in the United States and Canada is that the couple, as the intended parents and regardless of their gender, have the option to be listed on the birth certificate when the child is born.  The surrogate does not need to appear on the birth certificate.  As I have mentioned, in the UK, the surrogate must appear on the birth certificate.  She is the legal mother at the point of birth and, therefore, must be listed on the birth certificate.  We encourage our members to discuss every aspect of a surrogacy journey with their surrogate prior to commencement.  If it is required by local law that an agreement be made, that agreement should be made.  If that is not required, as is the case in the UK, we still encourage our members to make some form of agreement and to discuss with the surrogate what will happen when it comes to the issuing of a birth certificate.  Regardless of what is available in Canada and the United States, when they go there, most couples will ask the surrogate to be named on the birth certificate simply because, when they come back to Ireland, a birth certificate that lists two men as the parents will not work for Irish institutions such as the Passport Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":739,"content":"<p>There is also child benefit and everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#J00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":740,"content":"<p>We encourage all of our members to discuss the really important issue of how the birth certificate is going to look.

Clearly, it is better if the surrogate is willing to be a participant in that and to have her name listed on the birth certificate.

My first question is for Dr. Bracken.  With regard to pre-birth and post-birth agreements, what is included?  Is it only parentage?  If it is a post-birth agreement, does that ever conflict with any health decisions that need to be made during labour if, for example, something goes wrong or if there is a threat to the woman's life?  What is actually included in a pre-birth or post-birth agreement?  Does the woman's life still have protection if something awful were to happen?  Does the agreement affect that in any way, shape or form?<\/p> <p>  Obviously, the pathway to parentage is the preferred option but have there ever been other mechanisms in law used to give temporary rights with regard to consent for medical care?  The first thing that comes to mind would be care orders, although that would be an overreach.  Have any other mechanisms within the law been explored in the interim while the parental orders are being assessed to deal with that two-year wait before giving the other intended parents the right to consent in respect of education, medical care or passports?  Those are my two questions for Dr. Bracken.  I will then come to Mr. Lennon and Mr. Kenny Moore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#J00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her question.  On the different protections under a pre-conception or post-birth model, that is really a question for the Irish Legislature to decide.  If it decides to adopt a pre-conception approach, we can decide what the ethical standards within that approach will be.  Similarly, we can decide the standards that would apply under a post-birth approach.  If you look around the world, you will see that different standards apply under different systems, depending on the choices that have been made.  However, under a pre-conception model, the same ethical standards would apply as would apply under a post-birth model.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, as currently drafted, is very clear that the surrogate always retains bodily integrity throughout the pregnancy and makes the choices during the pregnancy.  Regardless of whether a pre-conception or post-conception approach is adopted, that would remain.  It is up to the Legislature to decide what the ethical safeguards are.<\/p> <p>  With regard to other measures that might be taken, as I mentioned a moment ago there is a proposal in the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill that guardianship could be granted to the intending parents at some point after the birth of the child by way of a statutory agreement with the surrogate, although I should say that is within the domestic surrogacy model.  As written, it seems that would be possible before a parental order is issued in the case of surrogacy.  There would therefore be some decision-making capacity.  There is a difficulty in that there would necessarily be a time lag before guardianship could transferred through the statutory declaration with the surrogate, which does not address the vulnerability issue we would be concerned about when the child is born.  That is certainly something that is proposed within the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lydia Bracken"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":743,"content":"<p>In Mr. Kenny Moore's statement, he said that, under our framework, if the legal parent dies, people can be left in limbo.

Let me explain how I understand that situation would work legally from my perspective as a non-legal person.  When the child returns to the State, whether the parents are a same-sex couple or an opposite-sex couple, the child does not really have any legal parent here in the State because the State recognises the surrogate mother as the automatic legal parent at the birth of the child.  The biological dad is not automatically recognised by the State at the point of birth.  He must therefore make an application for a declaration of parentage to establish his rights as a legal parent.  Assuming that application is successful and he becomes a parent, as we discussed last week, the other parent, whether a female or a male, is nobody in the child's life for the first two years.  He or she must apply for guardianship.<\/p> <p>  To touch on the Senator's question as to what happens if something were to happen to the legal father, who is now resident in the State, and if he were to die, the situation would be that the child would then be in the State being cared for by a guardian but the child would still have a legal parent, that is, the surrogate mother, who is living somewhere else.  We do not yet know how the State would react in that situation.  The rights of the legal parent, the surrogate mother, could potentially trump the rights of the guardian.  Has there been a case of this nature?  There was a case before the courts a number of months ago in which a legal father who had a child with his partner through surrogacy made an application because he had a terminal illness.  The guardianship application could not proceed because the child had not yet reached the age of two.  The case centred around establishing the right of the intended mother to apply for guardianship early and discussing what would happen to the child.  I do not know whether a ruling has been delivered in that case.  If the legal parent dies, the family is in a really precarious position because the child is now being cared for by a guardian but there is somebody outside the State who has higher authority, that is, the legal mother.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":745,"content":"<p>Is there potential for the State's child and family agency to step in and create another level of complexity in that situation with regard to care orders and so on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#J00900","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I would suggest so, though I do not know of a case that has happened yet.

What we can do is control the recognition or the establishment of legal parentage at home.  In doing so we can base our recognition of it on an equivalence of ethical standards.  That encourages any intending parents who are setting out on their surrogacy journey to first check to ensure everything they are doing will adhere to that ethical framework.  The AHR authority will have a role in that as well by disseminating information about what an ethical surrogacy looks like so anyone who is even contemplating taking on the surrogacy journey would know in advance what ethical standards need to be adhered to.  There would also need to be legal advice put in place before any surrogacy is entered into so the intending parents can know what needs to be adhered to in order for the recognition to be granted once the child comes home again.<\/p> <p>  On the ethical standards, I do not think we can require that the ethical standards here be identical to those in place in another country but we can ensure an equivalence of ethical standards and in doing so, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we need to rely on a human rights framework for that, namely, something that prioritises the human rights of all participants in the surrogacy.  For the surrogate, we need to ensure there is free and informed consent, that there are balanced power dynamics between a surrogate and the intending parents and that there are protections for the right to bodily integrity.  We need to ensure protection for the rights of the child and then also for the intending parents.  If a gamete donor has been used there must be protection for his or her rights as well.

I am a principal officer in the civil justice legislation function of the Department of Justice.  I am joined by Mr. Andrew Munro, assistant secretary, who has responsibility for civil justice policy and legislation.<br\/><br\/>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956.  Section 7 of the Act, which makes provision for Irish citizenship by descent, is applicable to children born outside Ireland through international surrogacy arrangements.  Section 7(1) provides that a person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen or would if alive have been an Irish citizen.  Section 7(3) provides that subsection (1) shall not confer Irish citizenship on a person born outside the island of Ireland whose Irish citizen parent was also born outside the island of Ireland, unless the person&rsquo;s birth is registered in the foreign births register, kept by the Department of Foreign Affairs under section 27 of the Act.  This requirement does not apply where the Irish citizen parent was abroad in the public service at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth.  Where a person&rsquo;s birth is registered in the foreign births register, the person&rsquo;s Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration, not from the date when the person was born.<br\/><br\/>Section 11 of the 1956 Act provides for citizenship of children adopted by Irish citizens, with effect from the date an adoption order is made or the date on which an intercountry adoption effected outside the State is recognised under the Adoption Act 2010.<br\/><br\/>In 2012, a guidance document was published on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel documents issues in relation to children born outside the State as a result of surrogacy arrangements.  The guidance document was agreed by an interdepartmental group on surrogacy, comprising the Departments of Justice, Health, Children, Foreign Affairs, and Social Protection, and the Office of the Attorney General.  The guidance document provides information to people who intend to enter surrogacy arrangements outside the State on the practical and legal considerations arising under Irish law where the intending parents intend to bring the child to live with them in the State.  The guidance document gives information on how legal parentage is established, how citizenship may be established, the information required for travel documents to issue for the child and the undertakings required to be given by the intending parents before travel documents are issued.<br\/><br\/>Under Irish law, the genetic father of a child born through surrogacy may apply for a declaration of parentage in respect of the child under the Status of Children Act 1987.  If the declaration of parentage is granted, the father will apply for guardianship under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  An Irish citizen genetic father will also, in most cases, apply for an order under section 14(3) of the Passports Act 2008, directing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may issue passports to the child without the consent of the birth mother until the child reaches the age of 18 years.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Justice is aware that issues regarding entitlement to Irish citizenship have arisen in relation to children born outside the State through surrogacy or donor-assisted human reproduction, where the Irish citizen intending parent is neither the birth mother nor the genetic father of the child.<br\/><br\/>There are some judicial review applications before the courts at present arising from passport applications made for children born outside the State through surrogacy or donor-assisted human reproduction and which involve issues relating to entitlement to Irish citizenship by descent under section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956.  The Supreme Court has recently determined that it will hear a leapfrog appeal on the question of the interpretation of section 7(1) of the 1956 Act in relation to entitlement to citizenship by descent in the context of surrogacy.  This issue arose in the High Court case of A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As these matters are currently before the courts, it would be inappropriate for the Department to comment further on them at this time.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracy O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I am the director of the passport service at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mrs. &Uacute;na Fannon, head of the policy and legal unit of the passport service, and Mr. Trevor Redmond, legal counsellor in the Department.  The Department of Foreign Affairs welcomes the opportunity to address the joint committee this morning.<\/p> <p>  The Department receives a significant and increasing number of requests for passports and consular services from Irish citizens who have entered into international surrogacy arrangements.  The Department is often the first State body encountered by Irish intending parents in their surrogacy journey as they seek to return to Ireland with a child following its birth overseas.  The role of the Department in these cases concerns the processing of applications for travel documents for children born through international surrogacy arrangements and also providing consular assistance as necessary in the country of birth.  <\/p> <p>  Our embassies and consulates provide consular assistance and are the main points of contact from the Department for Irish intending parents who are applying for an emergency travel certificate, ETC.  The passport service in Dublin prioritises the review of the ETC applications and approves the issuance of the ETC, which is then issued by the local embassy or consulate.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for the issue of passports and other travel documents to Irish citizens under the Passports Act 2008, as amended.  The 2008 Act clearly sets out the criteria for issuance of a passport to a child, including that the child must be an Irish citizen and that the guardians of the child consent to the issue of the passport.  In addition, section 15 of the 2008 Act specifically provides for the issuance of ETCs.<\/p> <p>  An ETC is not a passport but, rather, a temporary travel document for one-time use.<\/p><p>An ETC is valid for such period as the Minister considers appropriate to enable the person to undertake the journey in respect of which it is issued, generally within 72 hours.  An ETC includes a photo of the child, their details and the details of their intended travel.<\/p><p> In the absence of a specific legal framework for children born through international surrogacy, a guidance document, which was published by the then Department of Justice and Equality in 2012, provides guidance as to the principles that will be applied by the Irish authorities when considering whether a child is an Irish citizen and who the child's legal parents and guardians are for the purposes of dealing with applications for travel documents.  The guidance document was agreed by an interdepartmental group on surrogacy, which was comprised of the then Departments of Justice and Equality, Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Social Protection, and the Office of the Attorney General.  Among other things, the guidance document outlines the information required in order for a travel document to issue for the child.<\/p><p> In applying the guidance document of the Department of Justice and the Passports Act 2008, as amended, an approach to the processing of ETC applications has developed in consultation with the interdepartmental group on surrogacy.  The following is the general approach.<\/p><p> In order for an ETC to issue for a child born through international surrogacy, the Minister must be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is or may be an Irish citizen.  For a child born outside Ireland through surrogacy, this is typically based on their genetic link to an Irish citizen father.  In addition, the ETC application must be made by a parent or guardian of the child and the guardian or guardians of the child must consent to the issuance of the travel document.  When a child is born through a surrogacy arrangement, under Irish law the surrogate mother is the legal mother of the child.  If she is married then the surrogate mother's husband is presumed, by law, to be the father of the child.  Therefore, the husband will also, along with the surrogate mother, be the joint guardian of the child.<\/p><p> The documents required in such ETC applications relate to: the child; the Irish citizen genetic father; the surrogate mother; if the surrogate mother is married, her husband; and DNA evidence from a satisfactory source demonstrating that the Irish citizen intended father is the genetic father of the child.  A list of the documentary requirements has been shared with the committee and we are happy to answer any questions on them.<\/p><p> A number of key documents include: the child's birth certificate; a written undertaking from the Irish intended father that states he will notify his local health centre of the child's presence within two working days of their arrival in Ireland, and that he will apply to the Irish courts for a declaration of parentage and a guardianship order for the child; as well as an affidavit sworn by the surrogate mother in her native language consenting to the taking of DNA samples, the issuing of a travel document for the child and to the genetic father being made a guardian.  The affidavit should also state her marital status and confirmation that she has received independent legal advice.<\/p><p> With regard to the verification of documents, public documents issued in the country where the birth takes place must have an apostille certificate.  Affidavits and official documents that are provided in a language other than English must be accompanied by a notarised translation with an apostille certificate.<\/p><p> An apostille is an official government-issued certificate added to documents verifying the signature or seal or both of a public officer on a public document.  This means that the document will be recognised and accepted when presented in another country that has acceded to The Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents.<\/p><p> An apostille is issued by the designated competent authority of the State from which the document originates.  In Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for issuing apostille certificates on Irish public documents.  The requirement for documents and translations to be apostilled in the emergency travel certificate process allows for further verification that the documents are genuine, and means that the passport service can be satisfied that they are authentic.  Given the number of documents required, the process of gathering them can be lengthy.  The passport service takes very seriously its obligation to uphold the integrity of the process in order to protect all parties, including the child and surrogate mother.  The rights of the child are of paramount consideration.<\/p><p> Furthermore, our officials in overseas missions are obliged to comply with local law as well as with Irish law.  The Department will not facilitate the unlawful movement of children across national boundaries.  In jurisdictions where an international surrogacy case has not been encountered by the Department before, the Department seeks local legal advice to seek to ensure that it acts in compliance with local law.  This means that the ETC application process can be complex and time consuming.  The Department of Justice guidance document flags that commissioning adults intending to apply for a travel document for a child should plan for the possibility of the child having to remain in the country of birth until it has been established whether a travel document can be issued.   While we endeavour to deal with all applications as promptly and efficiently as possible, the Department can give no guarantee, before the birth of a child, that he or she will be regarded as an Irish citizen or that the intended father will be regarded as a parent or guardian of that child and, therefore, that a passport or other travel document can be provided for the child.<\/p><p> When intending parents contact us in advance of a child's birth we direct them to the Department of Justice guidance document, and advise them to ensure that they have both Irish and local legal advice.  We also advise them of the documentary requirements for a travel document application, and of the need to remain in the country of birth until it has been established whether a travel document can be issued.<\/p><p> The Department advises the HSE when the written undertakings, as set out in the Department of Justice guidance document, have been given by the intended father.  The Department also notifies border control that an ETC has been issued in respect of a child travelling to Ireland.  When the Irish court proceedings referenced in the intended father's written undertakings are complete, a court order is, typically, issued which relates to a declaration of parentage, guardianship and custody.  The court order will also, typically, dispense with the consent of the surrogate mother and, where applicable, her husband to the issuing of a passport to the child, and to the issuing of all travel documentation until the child reaches majority.  At this point, a father can submit a passport application for their child to the Passport Service.<\/p><p> The Department welcomes the work of this committee and hopes that its recommendations will bring greater clarity, and certainty, to the current travel document application process for children born outside the State through surrogacy, as well as to Irish intending parents.  In the meantime, we will continue to assist families going through this process.  We would welcome any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions and I now invite Senator Mary Seery Kearney to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#N00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":784,"content":"<p>This exchange is an unusual experience for me, and almost triggering for me, listening to the process being explored by officials, having gone through the process myself.<\/p> <p>  I wish to thank the officials for their extraordinary dedication, integrity and support that has been given throughout all of the years, and exceptionally so in the last number of months.  As evidence of that I have text messages from Department officials that were sent as early as 6 a.m. and as late as 1.30 a.m. on one Sunday morning.  They have shown extraordinary dedication to Irish citizens and prospective Irish citizens.  Mrs. Fannon was at the heart of it all.  I do not know how many emails that there have been at this stage but at the heart of all of that has been an extraordinary amount of work done by her and all of the officials.  I thank all of them.  The interdepartmental surrogacy group has worked extraordinarily hard over the last month in trying to deal with what is an unprecedented situation, particularly in terms of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  What the officials have set out for us is quite onerous and detailed.  The standard which parents or intended parents - they are parents to me - bringing home their child has to reach in terms of documentary and DNA evidence is very high.  All that is set out in a document provided by the Department of Justice as long as ten years ago in 2012.  The document was done by the Department officials and in conjunction with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter.  There are other finer details that I feel are important enough to be drawn out today.  I refer to the fact that the DNA evidence is not just a matter of doing a quick swab and placing that in an envelope.  The test is done by the Ormond Quay Paternity Services, which is a court recognised organisation in Ireland, and its standard of proof is accepted by the Irish courts in all sorts of paternity matters.  Also, the DNA evidence must be taken in the presence of an embassy official and a doctor who has been nominated by the embassy.  Therefore, a person cannot just run to any old doctor and pull them in.  The embassy must approve the doctor.  Everything is done in a transparent fashion.  Also, the surrogate mother must be present.  In recent weeks, we have had discussions about that, given we have people inside and outside of the Ukraine.  It is important that the public hears about the fastidious level of detail that is required.<\/p><p>When one arrives home in Ireland, the first thing one does is contact the public health nurse to register the baby.  Then one gets one's solicitor to issue proceedings because one has given an undertaking to do that.  Then one arrives into court and the Judiciary looks through one's documentation.  The fact that an emergency travel certificate was issued almost means, in and of itself, that a standard of proof has been reached.  In a sense, the witnesses are like gatekeepers, although I do not want to undermine the role of the Judiciary in this.  This has been vetted by people in the country in which the baby was born, departmental officials who are very experienced and then there is judicial oversight, before any of the orders that Ms O'Keeffe referred to so well are made.<\/p><p> Part of me just wants the witnesses to confirm what I have said.  By the time one has that emergency travel certificate in one's hand when coming home, a lot of work has gone into proving the bona fides.  One of the things that has been explained over the past few weeks is that the presence of the surrogate mother with the embassy official is, in itself, ensuring consent.  The point in all of that is that the intended mother is a bystander to all of this.  There is a delicacy and a sadness in that when one is a bystander to something so precious.  I invite the witnesses to comment on or confirm that before I move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#N00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":786,"content":"<p>On behalf of all of my colleagues in the Department, I thank the Senator for her kind words.  We have implemented quite a robust process.  It is absolutely the case that embassy officials do attend the DNA test where they get to meet the surrogate mother, which is just another safeguard.  The surrogate mother is met by an embassy official and that helps us in approving the emergency travel certificate application.  I would say, however, that the role of the Department is only to approve the emergency travel certificate at that point.  The intending parents have to go through a very robust judicial process on their return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Una Fannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1651100400,"counter":787,"content":"<p>The Department carries out the first vetting of the affidavits, of the consents and the bona fides of the individuals that are signing these.

We have embryological standards and we touched on that a little at our last meeting.  We know that embryos that were created in Ireland can be sent out to clinics abroad.  Those clinics have been confirmed by the likes of the Rotunda Hospital or other medical organisations in Ireland and then a baby is born.  If a predetermined genetic link could be established it would provide further assurance.  I am not in any way undermining the assurance provided by the documentation but there is a precariousness there in terms of a failed DNA test.  Guarantees cannot be given because nothing is known until the DNA result comes back.  That email is an extraordinary email to get and it gives one a huge sense of relief.  The issue is that a baby is born and if something could happen prior to that which would be of assistance in terms of the integrity and the safeguarding of the baby, that would be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#O00500","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":790,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs is really at the tip of the spear  We tend to be the first State body that parents encounter in their journey but the Department does not have a role in surrogacy or international surrogacy policy.

We heard from the previous witnesses, particularly Mr. Kenny Moore.  He spoke about passports in America and Canada, coming back here, the difference and how we learn.  That was a major issue for me.  The other issue is the timescale.  This is all technical and we are learning from this.  My biggest fear, and I have learned this through politics and life, as I believe all of us have, is that when one is dealing with three or four different Departments, it is an absolute nightmare.  One is going from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Justice to the Department of Health and to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  While there is no question that everybody is doing their best, it becomes a huge issue.  One Department will take a lead on this and another Department will take a lead on that.  Then one is in a situation where unless it is led by one particular area, it just does not work.  I have found over the years with different issues that it becomes a major barrier.  One Department will blame another Department regarding the timescale while another will say the person filled the form wrongly or that it does not go to that Department or it is all online.  It does not work.<\/p> <p>  For us and the Government to succeed on this legislation we must have one Department to lead it, be it the Department of Justice, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or whatever.  What do the witnesses see as their biggest hurdles when they are trying to work within the remits of different Departments?  Sometimes when one is dealing with Departments, one probably does not know who one is dealing with because people come and go and switch and swap.  I always find that to be an issue.  I believe we need to have a designated two or three people who can lead this.  There must be a specific area where anybody who wants that information is able to get it quite quickly.  Dealing with passports and other information is very sensitive.  We are dealing with very sensitive information here.  We are dealing with people's lives and how they are affected.  That is my biggest concern with this.<\/p> <p>  We must make sure we all work together on this.  There has been delay over the years.  One thing I have learned from meeting the witnesses over recent weeks is that their stories are heartbreaking.  They want the system right.  They want to be able to have legislation from which they can work.  They do not want to do anything wrong.  They just want to have a system that fits and is right, and we are not delivering on that.  We are failing badly here.  Those are my concerns from today, and perhaps the witnesses can respond to me.  Again, I know everybody is doing the best they can within their Departments, but when it happens that one is dealing with so many Departments, it just does not work.

That adds a different nuance for us.  While a streamlined process domestically would certainly be of benefit, it would not be possible for the process also to work for every country to which a family may go.  When we get a family going to a country we have not dealt with before, that can take longer because we need to establish what the local law is in that country and tweak the process to fit where necessary.

The guidelines that were developed in 2012 build on the existing legislative framework and there is a limit to what can be done within that, which is what we work within.<\/p> <p>  As has been said, the requirements of the guidelines are quite stringent, but they reflect what can be done in the context of the existing legislation.

We had a resident embassy there, so applications were taking approximately three to six weeks to be processed following the birth of the child.  There are several documents that cannot be put together until the child is born.  We are also dependent on the authorities in Ukraine, or any other relevant country, their processes and how long they take.  It was taking approximately three to six weeks after the baby was born in that jurisdiction.  As we mentioned, if it is a new jurisdiction where we have not previously had an ECT application, it can take considerable time to put the process in place and ensure all the documents meet our standards.  It is important that parents engage in the process early.  We often only hear about the birth after the fact.

What are the comments of the witnesses on this?  Do they see this as a practical solution?  Is it feasible?  What do they think about how we in this State can somehow accredit a process in another jurisdiction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022042800002#T01200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651100400,"counter":885,"content":"<p>This is the challenge with regulation that we mentioned the last day.  We are able to regulate health services here because we have enforcement and inspection.  Without mechanisms of enforcement and inspection I do not know how we would be assured of the standards of services abroad or even who would be in a position to do it.  Would it be the Medical Council or CORU?  It is quite a challenge to regulate standards in other countries.  In the European Union it is normally done through equivalence arrangements with somebody at the top and the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union.  There are also international conventions, such as with adoption.  It is quite difficult to see how the State would regulate private entities in another jurisdiction.
