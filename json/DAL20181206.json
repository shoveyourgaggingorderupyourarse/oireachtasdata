The proposals recognise the role agriculture has to play in helping member states achieve their environmental and climate change targets.  In this context, a significant feature of the proposals is the increased environmental ambition for the CAP post 2020.  The new CAP reform proposals require member states to set out their approach on environmental issues in the new CAP strategic plans.<\/p><p>There a number of new approaches to addressing environmental issues through the CAP including: three of the nine key objectives set for the CAP post 2020 concern the environment; the <i>ex ante<\/i>assessment for the plan must incorporate a strategic environmental assessment; the proposals include greater environmental conditionality on EU payments with links to requirements such as the water framework directive and proposals for mandatory nutrition management plans; 40% of the overall CAP budget must contribute to climate mainstreaming; member states must make schemes available as part of the direct payments that provide additional supports for eco schemes which go beyond the increased statutory management requirements and good agricultural and environmental conditions; nationally, 30% of the rural development programme expenditure, excluding payments for areas of natural constraints, must be focused on biodiversity-environment-climate related measures; and non-compliance with statutory management requirements and standards for good agricultural and environmental conditions of land in the areas of climate and environmental health, public health, animal health, plant health and animal welfare will require an administrative penalty.<\/p><p>Detailed proposals for new good agricultural and environmental conditions and statutory management requirements were included as part of the draft regulations published by the Commission last June, and I have arranged that the detailed list to be forwarded directly to the Deputy.  There are ten good agricultural and environmental conditions, GAECs, covering a range of issues, including permanent grassland, protection of wetland and peatland, and nutrient management plans.

That gives confidence to the dairy market.  I accept the Deputy's point that the industry is talking about 2019 being challenging.  However, it would be far more challenging if global dairy markets were to be as they are and we were to have not only the 370,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder intervention stocks we had this time last year but, in fact - if the Deputy had gotten his way - additiional intervention stocks added in the last 12 months.  To its credit, what the Commission has managed to do is reduce the overhang.

The floor price of skimmed milk powder was agreed to to protect dairy farmers' incomes.  If I had my way, the floor price would be kept in place and I make no apology for saying this.  It was agreed in the last round of CAP proposals that there would be a floor price in the purchase of 109,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder in each calendar year.  The Minister gave us a commitment that it was being taken away for one year only.  As he said, stocks have reduced greatly, but he has now given another commitment for 2019.  How can farmers have any faith that what was agreed to will be kept in place?  The taking away of the floor price of skimmed milk powder in 2018 had a dampening effect on skimmed milk powder prices.  That is fact.  The intervention product was sold significantly below the fixed price and the price processors received for skimmed milk powder all through 2018 was below the floor price.  That was the direct result of the European Commission taking away the floor price.  As the Minister admitted, we are facing into what will be a more difficult marketing year in 2019 and the Commission has already taken away one of the prime supports farmers need to stabilise markets.  I am extremely disappointed that he has allowed this to happen for a second year.  As he said, stocks have been greatly reduced.

It should be noted that the sector accounts for 7.9% of total employment, or approximately 174,000 jobs.  As most of these jobs are based outside of our cities, they are crucial to the rural economy.<\/p><p>Food Wise 2025 highlighted the need for the attraction, retention and development of skills and talent right along the food supply chain.  Investment in people is crucial for the success of Food Wise 2025 and the success of the sector as a whole.  The human capital recommendations contained in the strategy are more relevant than ever, as we see skills and labour shortages developing.  My Department has hosted two Food Wise 2025 skills workshops, involving all relevant stakeholders, to look at skills gaps and needs both at farm and at food and beverage industry levels.  This process of stakeholder engagement has led to two important reports, namely, the report on future skills needs in the food and drink sector, published last year, and the people in dairy action plan, which I launched in June of this year.  This incorporates a total of 29 specific actions which are organised into six key initiatives.  The specific recommendations in both reports are in the process of being implemented and progress will be reported periodically to the Food Wise high-level implementation committee, which I chair.<\/p><p>Labour supply issues have been most acute in meat processing and on farm in the horticulture and dairy sectors, although I am aware that some other parts of the industry, including pig, poultry and egg production, are also beginning to face the same issue.  While some potential exists to recruit labour from within the domestic and European labour markets, it has become apparent in recent times that this will be insufficient to meet the demand and, therefore, I and my officials have had extensive engagement with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and her Department in relation to employment permits for non-European Economic Area nationals.<\/p><p>I welcomed the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, of an initial pilot quota of employment permits for the horticulture, dairy and meat processing sectors in May, with a further allocation for meat processing in August.  While the number of permits allocated is relatively modest, at 500 for horticulture workers, 50 for dairy farm assistants and 750 for meat processor operatives, it is addressing the immediate shortage of labour.  Alongside the dedicated pilot scheme for the agrifood sector, an overarching review of the broader employment permit system has been carried out by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  My colleague the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, published the report on this review in September and my Department, having actively participated in the review, is now on an interdepartmental group tasked with implementing the recommendations.  I am confident that this exercise will lead to a permit regime that is more flexible and adaptable to the labour needs of the agrifood sector, particularly for seasonal employment.<\/p><p>I said at the time of the announcement of these permits that they were just one piece of the jigsaw in addressing labour supply and that the sector must also continue and intensify its efforts to source and retain labour from both the domestic and EU markets.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>In this regard, my officials have been working closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to assist in these efforts.

In the short and medium term that can be addressed by work permits but for the long-term sustainability of agriculture and to ensure that there is a constant pool of people with skills and who are interested in making a career beyond the traditional farm manager and farm apprenticeship schemes we have to be more creative and imaginative in terms of policy and within the industry.

There is uncertainty from Brexit and there is no doubt that there will be challenges from CAP.  A financial crisis on top of all that makes it next to impossible for farmers to continue to work at their trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600010#H00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1544096100,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I accept the Deputy's point.

The Deputy will recall that my colleague and predecessor, Deputy Simon Coveney, brought forward major legislative reform in the form of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which replaced legislation dating back over 100 years.  The Act enshrined the \"five freedoms\" concept and introduced mandatory standards to provide for positive welfare for animals.  I launched myself a new draft strategy on animal welfare in September.  The strategy has recently undergone a public consultation process and the responses, which are currently being examined, have been very positive.  As the Deputy will be aware, detailed debate was held around the issue of coursing during the passage of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and the D&aacute;il voted overwhelmingly to allow the continuation of hare coursing in accordance with the legislation which specifies that the hare must have a reasonable chance of escape.  I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of all animals and my Department devotes considerable resources to protect animal welfare and deal with breaches of animal welfare legislation.  Under the 2013 Act, a person can receive a fine on summary conviction of up to &euro;10,000 and on conviction on indictment of &euro;250,000 and-or imprisonment up to five years.  The Act provides for fixed penalty payments for lesser offences.  The Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased level of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.<\/p>  <p>  Coursing is regulated under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 by the Irish Coursing Club, subject to the general control of Bord na gCon.  The Irish Coursing Club is committed to maintaining high standards in the sport of coursing and it actively promotes the protection and conservation of the Irish hare.  Coursing operates in a highly regulated environment coupled with a comprehensive set of rules directly applied by the club.  Hares are sourced under licences from the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht which are issued annually and subject to a total of 26 conditions.  These measures include a requirement that a qualified veterinarian attend at all coursing meetings to report on the health of hares, a prohibition on the coursing of hares more than once in the same day, a prohibition on the coursing of sick or pregnant hares and a requirement that hares be released back into the wild during daylight hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600010#H00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1544096100,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I am tired of being told about the wonderful legislation.

Hurling, camogie, basketball, rugby and soccer are sports.  There is no glossing over the cruelty involved in live hare coursing, which cannot be called a sport.  Evidence of that cruelty exists where hares are used as live bait for dogs to chase.  People who attend coursing meetings see hares being terrorised as they run frantically around a field.  They are hit hard by the dogs and sent tumbling through the air.  The hares run in circles and sometimes leap over the dogs to try and escape.  On current numbers, there is evidence that hares are endangered.  Are we going to wait until the situation is as it is with the curlew and the corncrake and the hare is at risk of extinction?  I note also the injuries to the dogs involved.  I would love to know how many greyhounds are put down every year for failing to make the cut.

From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of biophysical criteria, namely, low temperature; dryness; excess soil moisture; limited soil drainage; unfavourable texture and stoniness; shallow rooting depth; poor chemical properties; and steep slope.

As a result of that research, my Department adopted a policy in 2012 which restricted such animals to the herd for life until slaughter, or allowed them to move to a restricted feedlot from where they would be slaughtered.  Such animals cannot be traded on the open market.  Allowing these animals to move to a restricted feedlot where, by nature of the official supervisory protocol in place, all animals are slaughtered, they are prevented from circulating with other animals which may be sold on the open market.  This means the risk of them causing a new TB breakdown is further reduced. <\/p>  <p>  Under the tuberculosis programme, a feedlot herd is a restricted herd that comprises a non-breeding unit which disposes of all cattle direct for slaughter and fulfils at least one of the following three criteria.  First, the cattle are permanently housed and never on pasture.  Second, there are no contiguous holdings or lands with cattle, meaning they must not have any neighbour contacts either through cattle being confined exclusively in yards or buildings or, if intending to graze cattle, the land is secured in order that there can be no contact with cattle, for example, surrounded by tillage, residential, industrial or recreational units or impenetrable rivers, roads or walls.  Third, the boundaries are walled, double-fenced or equivalent so as to prevent any direct contact with cattle on contiguous lands, premises or holdings.

I agree with him that it is simply not good enough, but all the same, it needs to be said that what families expect and want when their loved ones go into hospital is that they receive the highest quality of care and that if mistakes are made, they will be exposed quickly through the systems that pick them up and that we learn lessons from them in order that they are less likely to be repeated in the future.

The report has found that 11 patients had their diagnosis of cancer delayed and that four of them have since passed away.  Some of the 11 patients received the report by taxi, which is not an appropriate or patient-centred way to deliver a report to any victim.  Our thoughts are with the families, in particular, at this very difficult time and all those affected by the scandal.  While I welcome the publication of the report, there are a number of outstanding issues on which we require clarification which I hope the T&aacute;naiste will be in a position to provide.  <\/p>  <p>  First, less than two pages of the report deal with recommendations to prevent a similar situation from arising in the future.  When asked yesterday by my colleague, Councillor Toir&eacute;asa Ferris, what was the timescale for implementation of the recommendations, hospital management could not give her an answer.  Unless management accept its failings and responsibilities and puts measures in place to address what happened, it can and could happen again.  The concerns about misdiagnoses and hospital scans were being raised by hospital staff and GPs and it seems that the appropriate action was not taken until a later stage.  Therefore, I want to know what are the HSE and the Minister going to do about it?  Will a timeline for implementation of the recommendations be produced and will it be published?<\/p>  <p>  The matter of most concern is that, over a year after the issue first came to light, not only are guidelines on the volume of work radiologists should be undertaking not in place but the process to develop them does not seem to have even started.  What specifically is being done about this and will the guidelines be produced without delay?  That is absolutely crucial because the workload of the consultant in question was a key contributory factor in patients receiving a misdiagnosis or there being a delayed diagnosis.  That issue needs to be addressed urgently.  <\/p>  <p>  The report acknowledges that four people died as a result of receiving a misdiagnosis or there being a delayed diagnosis, but there is a fifth person whose family believe she passed away as a result of the same factor.  She had been told that her case was part of the review in February, but she heard nothing after that point.  Unfortunately, she has since passed away.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give an assurance that the hospital will engage with her family in order that they can receives the answers they are so desperately seeking?<\/p>  <p>  There is a real possibility that people may have to go through the courts to get justice in what clearly are cases of medical negligence.  We already know that one application has been lodged.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give us an assurance that that will not happen and that the hospital and the HSE will engage with victims and families to ensure they do not have to through the rigmarole of the convoluted legal process to get justice?  In some cases people are terminally ill.  The issue is time sensitive and we need to ensure action will be taken immediately, something which has not happened heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600013#L00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1544097900,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The report was only published in the past 48 hours.

I do not know the circumstances of each individual case.  Therefore, in the circumstances we should be careful about what we say in apportioning blame.  Families who still have questions to ask and need answers need to receive the full co-operation of the hospital and the HSE.  The review was triggered by complaints which led to concerns about the quality of care patients were receiving in the hospital.  As a result, all of the scans and workload linked with one consultant doctor were re-examined, from which we have learned lessons which raise serious questions which need responses.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have the guidelines on the workload of radiologists in front of me, but I expect that there would not be a problem with making them available.  It is the job of the HSE and hospital management to make sure they have teams available that can work in a way that is consistent with medical guidelines.  If there are a family or an individual to whom the Deputy is referring with particular concerns, I do not have their details, but if the Deputy makes them available, I will certainly ensure the Minister's office is made aware of them.  We are trying to ensure the response will be patient-centred, that lessons will be learned, that systems will be put in place on the back of the mistakes made to make sure they will not happen again and that if families continue to have concerns or questions to which they need answers, the hospital and the HSE will provide them.

I mentioned one of the 11 patients who was identified in the report as having received a misdiagnosis or in respect of whom there was a delayed diagnosis which had resulted in severe negative outcomes for his health.  Between March and October 2016, the now 71 year old who is a husband, a father and a grandfather had three chest X-rays, in which his cancer was not picked up.  The radiologist whose work was reviewed is not the only one who was involved in the case; there was another doctor who reported on at least one of the scans.  The symptoms persisted and, at the insistence and because of the persistence of his wife, the GP referred the man in question for another X-ray in early 2017 when his lung cancer was finally diagnosed.  The error had not been detected and despite the delayed diagnosis, he was scheduled for a CT scan in June that year, months after the misdiagnosis had been identified.  His wife persisted and ensured that the scan was brought forward to April.  It was discovered that the cancer had spread at such a rate that it was wrapped around the main artery to his heart.  He went through what his wife described as \"horrific treatment\", but it was too late.  I am informed that he only has a short time left and that the family firmly believe that if the cancer had been detected in any of the three earlier X-rays, it would not have been terminal.  They have asked me to make the point that they have to fight for appointments in the health service to receive the care and treatment needed.  They have to fight for grant aid in order to provide such basic things as a downstairs toilet in order that the man in question who was failed by the health service can live out his final days in comfort.  He is on oxygen 24 hours a day and his family are devastated.  They are appealing to me to ask the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the Government not to force an individual who has been so let down and failed to go through a complicated legal process.  We need to ensure we wrap him and his family in the supports available, provide grant aid without them having to fight for it and appointments without them having to demand that his treatment be fast-tracked.  It is not patient-centred and the family should not have to go to court.  I want assurances from the T&aacute;naiste that everything that can be done will be done to provide the best treatment available for the individuals affected in whatever days they have left and that a process will be put in place to avoid their having to take the legal route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600013#L00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1544098500,"counter":147,"content":"<p>The family to which Deputy Pearse Doherty refers is clearly going through a very traumatic time.

On Monday she will head out to the airport and take the 7.50 a.m. Ryanair flight to Barcelona.  Her name is Noreen O'Neill.  She is the mother of a two year old boy, Michael, her first and only child.  Michael will not be going on the trip as flying is not good for him.  He was born with bilateral frontal polymicrogyria, a drug-resistant epilepsy.  The condition caused Michael to suffer up to 20 convulsions per day before he even reached his first birthday.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish health service offered Noreen ten different anti-convulsive medications for Michael but, unfortunately, none of them worked.  In January of this year Noreen began treating Michael with cannabidiol, CBD oil, which served him well and for four full months he was seizure free.  When the seizures returned in the summer Noreen increased Michael's CBD dosage.  He is now at maximum dosage but the seizures, far fewer than before the treatment began, have not gone away.  Noreen tried to get a licence for tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, under the licensing system introduced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  However, each one of the three neurologists she approached declined to apply for the licence, which left Noreen with two choices: watch her son stay gripped by seizures, as they possibly worsen, or go to Barcelona.  Barcelona is the home of the Kalapa Clinic, which has been overseeing Michael's CBD dosage in recent months via Skype.  It is at the Kalapa Clinic that Michael's first prescription dosage of THC is now being made up.

The programme will provide access for patients who are under the care of a medical consultant for the following medical conditions which have failed to respond to standard treatments: spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and severe treatment-resistant epilepsy, which appears to be the issue to which Deputy Barry refers in relation to Michael.<\/p>  <p>  An expert reference group has drawn up operational, clinical and practice guidelines for healthcare professionals treating patients through the programme and has advised that cannabis oils should be used for the purpose of achieving accuracy and consistency of dosage for patients.

One of the reasons for that is there is a chill factor for neurologists.  THC is still illegal below a very low dosage and neurologists are nervous about that.  THC is a schedule 1 drug that is not prescribed for medical purposes.

The report outlined how health administrators and hospitals are asking people to use minor injury units where possible to avoid having to go to busy emergency departments.  People attending one such unit in Smithfield in Dublin were glowing in their praise for the speed with which they were being seen and treated for minor injuries and ailments.  They compared the experience with their previous experiences of spending hours waiting to be seen at hospital emergency departments.<\/p><p>That unit is one of 11 minor injury units dotted throughout the country that were designed to take the pressure off emergency departments.  They deal with broken bones, dislocations, sprains, minor scalds and burns.  I know from speaking to staff on a visit to the unit in Roscommon that it takes an average of 55 minutes from the time a person comes in the door until he or she goes back out having been seen and treated.  I also know from a visit to the emergency department at University Hospital Galway that patients sitting in the waiting room for hours on end face a screen that pops up with a message advising them to use their local minor injury unit as a speedy alternative to the emergency department.  It is good advice, but for the fact that Galway is the only major urban area in the country that actually does not have such a unit.<\/p><p>I have raised this matter before in the House.  The first time was during Leaders' Questions two years ago with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  As recently as March of this year I raised it with the current Taoiseach.  At the time, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, agreed that there was merit in my suggestion for such a unit to be opened at Merlin Park University Hospital in Galway.  He added:<\/p><blockquote>It works in Dublin, Limerick and Cork. Why would it not work in Galway, therefore?  I will certainly appraise the proposal and discuss it with the Minister for Health and the HSE.<\/blockquote><p>Unfortunately, I am still waiting to see the proposal being acted upon.  The idea is what we could call a no-brainer.  More than 60,000 people every year are crowding into the cramped and outdated emergency department at University Hospital Galway.  Three quarters of them are discharged after being seen and treated without being admitted to hospital.  Most of the 45,000-plus people would benefit from the availability of the option to go to a minor injuries unit where they could be seen and treated in a fraction of the time it takes today.  As the Taoiseach put it, there are injury units in Dublin Limerick and Cork - there are two more in Cork county - why not Galway?<\/p><p>University Hospital Galway is one of the busiest hospitals in the country with ever-increasing waiting lists and growing numbers spending nights on trolleys in the corridors of the emergency department.  All of these people would benefit from a minor injuries unit.  If funding were allocated, it could be up and running next year.

It may be interested to know that a survey by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland found that the vast majority of apartment and multi-unit developments in Ireland have not set aside adequate funds for maintenance and refurbishment.  My Bill seeks to simplify the situation and clarify for what the funds should be used.<\/p><p>I have referred to this issue as a ticking time bomb and raised it directly with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who has just left the Chamber, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, most recently on 14 November.  They are of the view that the number of units that would be affected by the Bill is quite low.  That is not the case.  Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to be constructive in bringing the Bill forward.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes four changes to the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 which currently sets out the legal requirements for sinking funds.  Of most importance is that it would transfer the responsibility for that Act from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, which is where it should be.  It makes the establishment of a sinking fund mandatory within one rather than three years and makes sinking funds a separate part of annual financial statements.  It mandates an overall sinking fund report on future plans every five years, which is crucially important.<\/p><p>Approximately 90% of developments are not providing for a sinking fund for future works that may be required.  There are also many defective developments which have been abandoned by insurers and bondholders.  The Bill will help to simplify the process.  It ensures clear responsibility in regard to the prudent creation of a sinking fund for apartment blocks and multi-unit developments and the timely provision of information on the status of the fund.  According to the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland, which I thank for its work on this issue, three out of four property managers surveyed stated that less than 25% of apartment buildings and multi-unit developments have set aside adequate funds for such works.  This is a massive issue for our country, affecting 200,000 homes and 500,000 people.In addition, almost 90% of the managers stated that they had been forced to raise additional levies for buildings under their management.  It is clear that we need to strengthen the law in this sector, because as these apartment blocks and multi-unit developments get older, they will need more investment.<\/p><p>This sector has too often been forgotten.  As I mentioned, more than half a million people live in multi-unit developments.  The Government can do a lot more and that is why this is the third Bill I have published in this area.  It is one of several measures proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I have published a Bill to create an ombudsman under the auspices of the Property Services Regulatory Authority for owner management companies, of which there are approximately 7,000 in this country.  That would assist the lay directors of such companies with legal advice and, at least, give them an office with which they could raise any issues.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has also published a Bill to recognise and provide for people who are paying management fees for their principal private residence as well as full local property tax.  There ought to be a partial reduction in local property tax for those who pay management fees.  That legislation proposes a maximum reduction of &euro;300 in local property tax in that regard.<\/p><p>I hope that in the interests of co-operation, being responsible and waking up to the fact that this is a major problem, the Government will work with Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties, as has been done on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, to ensure that this Bill is passed quickly through the House.  It will make a difference.  It differs substantially from other legislation awaiting First Stage or Second Stage.  I acknowledge that the Ceann Comhairle is working hard to ensure that Private Member's Bills such as this pass through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600018#Q00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1544100900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600018#Q00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1544100900,"counter":206,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600018#Q00500","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544100900,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544100900,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Member's Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600018#Q00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1544100900,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600018#Q00800","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544100900,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018: First Stage","time":1544100900,"counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600018#Q01000"},{"type":"speech","time":1544100900,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to place a cap on moneylenders&rsquo; interest rates, by amending the Consumer Credit Act 1995.<\/blockquote><p>Leaflets from legal and licensed moneylenders have been distributed recently in my part of County Donegal, an area of high deprivation which has more than double the national unemployment rate.  Such leaflets are also being distributed in other working-class areas across the State.  The moneylenders know that Christmas is on the way and that working and other families are under huge pressure to provide for a memorable Christmas.<\/p><p>Six and a half years ago, I first moved similar legislation.  The then Fine Gael and Labour Party Government told me that moneylenders were a necessary evil and that many people had no alternative but to use them.  I disagreed with that analysis then and I still disagree with it.  However, several changes have taken place over the past six and a half years, especially the &quot;It makes sense&quot; credit union loan scheme which is available to those on low incomes.  If the excuses offered at that are again presented, they must be challenged.<\/p><p>The Centre for Co-operative Studies in University College Cork has reinvigorated the debate with an excellent report on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation which was published in recent weeks.  It cites the economic unfairness inherent in this type of lending, referring to further research which indicates there is &quot;A huge transfer of resources and potential assets from poor communities to the directors and shareholders of loan companies&quot;.  We, as legislators, are allowing money to be transferred out of the pockets of the poorest in society and into the pockets of the shareholders and directors of companies that leech off the pain and poverty of those people.  Global research, in particular that carried out in the United States, indicates that low-income house owners are stripped of approximately $9.1 billion each year through the practices of the so-called alternative credit sector.<\/p><p> Research in Britain found that from three streets, on which there were 40 households, a staggering &pound;240,000 was being paid each year to high cost lenders.  This type of lending simply takes money off poor families and makes them poorer.  The lending is concentrated in the areas where there are high levels of deprivation, unemployment and poverty.  We need to ensure proper regulation and that we bring forward laws within which the Central Bank can be allowed to work.  The Central Bank is carrying out good research on this issue.  It began a process of consultation.  It is considering the issues of advertising and other regulations, but it is staying clear of the issue of a cap.<\/p> <p> My legislation - it is a very simple Bill - proposes to introduce a cap.  The rates we currently see being charged in the market - 100% and 200% - are simply wrong.  I echo the words of the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in saying people are being ripped off.  Let us put our money where our mouths are.  We need to act on behalf of these individuals.  The rates being charged are completely wrong and immoral.  The lenders have no moral authority to engage in lending of this nature, regardless of the circumstances.  The legislation I propose would place a cap of 36% on the rates moneylenders could charge.  There are no ifs and buts.  That is the maximum amount any moneylender would be able to charge within the State.  Credit unions can charge 1% per month or an APR of 12% for this type of lending.  I am open to reviewing the cap if it would allow more credit unions to move into the space of lending to low income families.  In introducing the cap many years ago we showed that we considered a 12% cap to be necessary for credit unions.  On the other hand, we are happy to allow moneylenders to charge 187% per annum.  I intend to proceed to Second Stage next week.  I ask all parties to support the legislation to ensure the thousands of families who are forced to sign up to ridiculous rip-off rates just in order that they can have a decent Christmas, fix the car, pay for the First Holy Communion or birthday of their child or meet an unexpected funeral expense would no longer be forced to do so.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600018#Q01100","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544101500,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600019#R00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1544101500,"counter":215,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600019#R00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544101500,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544101500,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600019#R00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1544101500,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600019#R00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544101500,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"EU Regulations: Motion","time":1544101500,"counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600019#R00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1544101500,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No. 516\/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council, as regards the re-commitment of the remaining amounts committed to support the implementation of the Council Decisions (EU) 2015\/1523 and (EU) 2015\/1601 or the allocation thereof to other actions under the national programmes,a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 20th November, 2018.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600019#R00900","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544101500,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016: From the Seanad","time":1544101500,"counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600019#R01100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544101500,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il went into Committee to consider an amendment from the Seanad.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544101500,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 1:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544101500,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544101500,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment reported.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544101500,"counter":228,"content":"<p>A message will be sent to Seanad &Eacute;ireann acquainting it accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600019#R01600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544101500,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 1.55 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Climate Change: Statements","time":1544102100,"counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600020#V00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1544102100,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I believe we are expecting a number of Ministers and spokespersons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600020#V00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1544102100,"counter":232,"content":"<p>We are, and five minutes is very limited time, so I will try to be brief and perhaps just refer to matters that were not referred to in the committee yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  The emissions figures for 2017 have been published and, overall, show a slight reduction in carbon emissions.  The areas that drove this reduction were energy, which is down 6.9%, residential, which is down 5%, and transport, which is down 2.4%.  It is acknowledged, however, that a good deal of the reduction in transport was the result of transport tourism, whereby petrol and diesel are purchased elsewhere.  The areas where there emissions continue to increase are agriculture, which is up 2.9%, industry and manufacturing, which is up 3.4%, and public services, which is up 6.7%.  This is disappointing.  It is a fairly familiar story and follows the pattern of last year and the year before last.  The underlying difficulty is that we have not succeeded in breaking the connection between carbon emissions and economic growth.  Overall, as we look to 2020, the prediction is that we will effectively be 95% off target and will only achieve a 1% reduction by 2020.  There is, therefore, a need to step up massively our commitment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, the national mitigation plan was published in July 2017 and sets out the signposts of the direction of travel.  The national development plan went into much more detail and set out detailed projects, with &euro;30 billion provided for sustainable transport and climate action.  The plan has a very strong pipeline of projects, but this transition plan shows that even with this, we will be 47 million tonnes off target.  Of this figure, the national development plan will meet 27 million tonnes, so there still is a very substantial amount of work to be done.  For this reason, I will develop a whole-of-Government strategy.  I have the agreement of Cabinet to come back to Government early in the new year with such a strategy and I will seek to have it implemented on the same basis as we implemented the Action Plan for Jobs.  There will be oversight from my Department but also the support of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet committee to ensure actions committed to are timelined and delivered.<\/p><p>That has been an area, or at least an approach, that has been successful where the co-ordination of a number of Departments is being sought, especially where line businesses may draw their eyes elsewhere.  It is crucial that we deliver on our climate change commitments on a cross-government basis.  The national mitigation plan sets out 20 actions that have not been delivered within the timescale envisaged.  There are 22 actions which are complete and 14 which are entirely new commitments, while many of the others are on track.  On the 20 actions that have not been delivered, it is mainly because they have been delayed.  If we had time, I could go through them in detail.   They have mostly been delayed by a short time, are partially complete or, for example, in the case of carbon tax, where there was to be an examination of its impact, we have the report from the Economic and Social Research Institute.  From the point of view of the Oireachtas, therefore, we have the material to deliver that action.  There are, however, some actions that are at the evolutionary stage of their development.  We will need to inject an impetus not just into all of these 20 areas but also way beyond them.  <\/p> <p> The report, usefully, also shows some of the new things that are developing and worthy of note by the Oireachtas.  They include the &euro;3 billion green bond that was raised, the higher biofuel blend, in which I know Deputy Stanley is interested, the carbon price evaluation by the ESRI which has been published and the new ambition for renewables - that 55% of our power will come from renewables by 2030.  Today, the figure stands at about 30%.  Good progress has been achieved on the emissions trading system, ETS, in other words, the cap and trade element, which is of relevance to the big power users.  Our target is to be down by 37% in 2020.  It has been a success.  <\/p> <p> The report also points to the new renewable heat scheme that will be starting with subsidies of 30%.  I refer also to the new heat pump grant that was introduced for households in September last year and the new excellence in energy efficiency design, EXEED, programme for the commercial and industrial sectors, in which it has been piloted at 24 locations.  <\/p> <p> There were very important environmental regulations for near zero energy buildings and renovations.  The first compressed natural gas station was also reported, as well as ongoing planting of forestry.  It is a good compendium, but we are clearly at the start of a project to which we need to ramp up our commitment radically.  <\/p> <p> This week I was in Katowice where the climate action conference was held.  It was organised by the United Nations and the message was very stark.  The window to act to prevent catastrophic complications for the globe is closing rapidly.  On the positive side, most of the technologies we need to apply to meet our commitments are available.  It is a question of finding the policy tools and funding mechanisms to allow them to happen.  It is a major challenge but one that, if we work together across the House, we can meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600020#V00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544102400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I am pleased to deliver the annual transition statement on climate change adaptation on behalf of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Minister, Deputy Madigan.

The draft plan also formed the basis of a stakeholder workshop which was held on 16 October.  There were 40 participants which represented various sectors and included staff from the regional climate change offices and the NPWS.  The workshop sought feedback and inputs on various matters, including climate impacts and consequences for the biodiversity sector, adaptation actions and cross-sectoral linkages. The draft plan is being redrafted and reformatted to reflect the sectoral guidelines published in May and the feedback and inputs received from other sectors and actors.  We will endeavour to ensure the revised draft biodiversity sectoral climate change adaptation plan will be subject to public consultation in January 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The following climate change risks to biodiversity have been identified to date.  I refer to changes in species abundance, changes in species distribution, disruption of species interactions, loss of species, the arrival and spread of non-native species, changes in the composition of communities, the loss of habitat area and changes in the functionality of habitats.  As well as the direct impact on biodiversity, there may be consequences for the delivery of ecosystem services required for human well-being.  As an example, changes in the functionality of habitats may reduce the capacity for water retention or the control of non-native species may be very costly to the Exchequer. <\/p>  <p>  I dtaobh na hoidhreachta t&oacute;gtha agus seand&aacute;la&iacute;ochta, ceapadh saineolaithe i nDeireadh F&oacute;mhair chun cabhr&uacute; le plean oiri&uacute;naithe earn&aacute;la a ullmh&uacute;.

The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht made a presentation to the national adaptation steering committee on 4 July on the potential impact of climate change on the built and archaeological heritage.  The following climate change risks to the built and archaeological heritage have been identified to date arising from the potential to have warmer, wetter winters - increased intensity of storms, a rise in sea levels, coastal erosion and increased flooding.  They include structural damage to monuments and historical properties, coastal erosion undermining structures or leading to loss of ground adjacent to the structure, exposure and the erosion of archaeological sites, the collapse of unstable masonry elements such as chimneys and roofs, the loss of historical landscape features such as trees and the impact on building fabrics, including increased saturation, mould and fungal growth in interiors and on contents and increased corrosion of metal elements.  <\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; beartaithe plean a bheith curtha le ch&eacute;ile faoi shamhradh 2019, le tr&eacute;imhse chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in phoibil san &aacute;ireamh.

In the past year the Office of Public Works has launched the flood risk management plans that detail the risk and feasible measures to address flooding from rivers and sea which are the primary sources of flood risk.  It not only looked at flood risk and its impact today, it also studied the flood risk and impact in two potential climate change scenarios in the future.  <\/p><p>The catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, CFRAM, that delivered the plans was the largest national study ever undertaken of the risk posed by significant flood events, or one in 100 year floods, and followed best practice.  In 2012, 300 communities were selected for the study as they were the most likely to be impacted on by future flooding, including 90 coastal communities.  These communities represent 80% of the national potential risk and are home to almost two thirds of the population.  While the CFRAM programme assessed flood risk in all large urban areas, approximately one quarter of the communities had a population of less than 500 people, while half of thelm had a population of less than 2,000.  On 31 May, with the Taoiseach, the Minister of State launched the flood maps for these communities.  The plans set out how we can manage flood risk both for these communities and nationally.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State also announced a &euro;1 billion investment in a further 118 flood relief schemes in the coming decade.  It will mean that, together with the 42 schemes completed and 33 under way, the Government can protect 95% of properties assessed as being at risk from a one in 100-year flood.  A new website, <i>www.floodinfo.ie<\/i>, on which people can view the maps and plans by location, was also launched.<\/p><p>At the start of this ten-year programme of investment the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, announced that the Office of Public Works, OPW, working with local authorities, would be starting work on detailed design for 50 of the 118 new flood relief schemes.  He is pleased to report that there has been proactive engagement since between the OPW and the local authorities on the arrangements and structures to be put in place to advance implementation of the first tranche of projects.  Project inception meetings have focused on the establishment of project steering groups, governance structures and the resource and procurement requirements.  The OPW has already put in place frameworks of engineering design consultants and environmental consultants which are helping to expedite the delivery process.<\/p> <p> In the past year the OPW has either work completed or work under way on flood relief schemes to protect 80% of the properties assessed to be at risk of significant flooding.  All schemes are designed and built in line with international best practice.  It includes ensuring they can be adapted in the future for potential climate change.  Measures have been put in place for the at-risk properties where investment in a flood relief scheme is not feasible.  The minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme put in place during the past year remains a valuable measure to address localised flood risk.  The OPW has committed to the investment of &euro;5.6 million in 65 localised schemes by local authorities.  The work of the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group, chaired by the Minister of State, is also focused on climate change adaptation measures for flood risk management.<\/p> <p> Significant progress has been achieved this year by Met &Eacute;ireann and the OPW in establishing the flood forecasting service, including the appointment of a chief hydrometerologist who is leading the delivery of this service.  The publication by the OPW in the past year of flood risk maps, developed by the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which include maps reflecting the impact of future climate change, is a valuable resource to inform local authorities in their preparation of local and sectoral adaptation plans in 2019 and planning decisions, as well as in planning emergency responses.<\/p> <p> The work done by the OPW in the past year in adopting measures to adapt for climate change has been significant.  In particular, the launch of the flood risk management plans demonstrates the proactive approach taken in addressing the possible impact of climate change, both in planning to manage flood risk and the delivery of flood relief schemes.  The Minister of State is confident that the focus on climate change in flood risk management will allow the investment made today to be easily adaptable to deal with the impact of climate change in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600021#W00300","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544103000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I am making this statement on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the mobilising of Ministers with responsibility for the largest carbon emitting sectors in our society.  It is timely in the light of the fact that COP 24 is taking place this week in Poland, with the aim of finalising implementation of the Paris climate change agreement.  This engagement demonstrates that, similarly, the Government supports the commitment to tackle climate change and reduce national emissions.  It is clear that we face an enormous challenge.  It is only through collective ambition and cross-departmental efforts that Ireland will begin to transition to a low carbon society and achieve our long-term goals.<\/p>  <p>  Transport has a critical, yet challenging, role to play in the national mitigation effort.  It is a sector in which fossil fuel use is firmly embedded and travel demand is growing owing to economic recovery and a growing population.  Despite this growth in demand, 2017 saw a welcome fall in transport emissions for the first time in four years.  However, we must be on our guard.  Despite technological advancements in improving vehicle efficiencies and new lower carbon fuels, we continue to grapple with the reality that emissions savings from cleaner vehicles are being offset by strong growth in transport demand.  We must remain proactive in seeking to decouple demography and the economy from climate emissions.<\/p>  <p>  In transport we are doing this through four main avenues.  First, there is increased investment in sustainable mobility.  Improving public and active transport services and infrastructure is key if Ireland is to cater in an environmentally sustainable way for increasing travel demand and provide a meaningful alternative to the private car.  Under the national development plan, &euro;8.6 billion has been committed to public and active transport in the next ten years.  Forthcoming key projects include MetroLink, BusConnects, the DART expansion programme and increased funding for cycling and walking infrastructure across the State.  Prioritising investment in the public transport network is working.  During the reporting period of 2017 alone, an additional 16 million public transport passenger journeys were made, while the number of walking and cycling trips also increased, particularly in the greater Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  The second strand employed to reduce transport emissions is promoting a switch away from fossil fuels to lower emitting alternative power sources.  Even with an expanded and enhanced public transport system, some people will not be in a position to move away from the car.  In these cases we need to encourage a move towards cleaner alternatives.  Under the national policy framework for alternative fuels infrastructure for transport, the national ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold be zero emissions capable was clearly outlined.  To support this ambition, a low emissions vehicle task force was established to accelerate the deployment of low carbon transport technologies.  Phase 1 of the work of the task force focused solely on incentivising electric vehicles.  Several of its recommendations were adopted in budgets 2018 and 2019, expanding the suite of supports available for electric vehicles.  The impact of these incentives is seen clearly this year, with significant growth in electric vehicle sales and increasing numbers of low or zero emissions vehicles on the road.  Phase 2 of the work of the task force is under way, focusing on promoting other alternative fuels and technologies, including natural gas, biomethane and hydrogen.  The task force in its work puts emphasis on the heavy duty vehicle sector which accounts for nearly one fifth of transport emissions.  In the coming years I hope, with the support of the task force, to see movement towards cleaner fuels in this competitive sector.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, in the light of the commitment that from summer next year no more diesel only buses will be purchased for the urban public bus fleet, the Department is launching a low emissions bus trial next week.  The trial will assess a range of alternative fuels and technologies to further inform future bus purchasing decisions.  Not only will new cleaner buses reduce emissions, they will also provide the opportunity for the public to experience the benefits of non-conventional fuels and begin to normalise their uptake in other transport areas too.<\/p>  <p>  The third channel which plays a major role is the biofuels obligation scheme.  The percentage rate of biofuels as a share of road transport energy has doubled since 2010.  It is intended that the blend of biofuels will continue to increase incrementally on a sustainable basis in the future.  Owing to heavy reliance on oil in the transport sector, this is a critical mitigation tool.  In 2017 alone, biofuel use reduced transport emissions by over 3% without impacting on travel activities.  It is making an important contribution to reducing transport emissions.<\/p>  <p>  We are tackling emissions through the use of better vehicle standards.  We are pushing at European level to achieve more efficient production standards to ensure all cars, vans and trucks registered in Europe will increasingly be more efficient.  This presents Irish consumers with cleaner vehicles and a greener choice.  Not only are we delivering measures to reduce transport emissions, we must also improve the transport sector&rsquo;s resilience in dealing with the effects of climate change.  In 2017 my Department published its first sectoral adaptation plan, developing resilience to climate change in the transport sector, in which risks facing the sector were identified.  We have experienced the consequences of extreme weather events, with damage to infrastructure and disruption caused to public transport services.  Key transport stakeholders are making great strides in climate adaptation, identifying vulnerable areas and future proofing them to withstand more extreme weather events.  We will continue to build this capacity to ensure Ireland stays safely on the move, regardless of the changing climate.  We will continue to work with agencies to raise awareness and build our resilience to climate change.  We face a challenge to decarbonise our society.  The Department is deeply committed to taking on this challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600022#X00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1544103000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I am pleased to present the annual transition statement on the agriculture, forest and land use sector on behalf of the Department and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  As one of the key sectors involved in the first national mitigation plan, it is only right to restate the vision for the sector which is an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  This is consistent with the principles of both the Paris Agreement and the European Council conclusions of October 2014 which recognised the role of agriculture and land use in tackling climate change and their contribution to achieving climate ambitions.<\/p><p>One of the first actions we committed to in the national mitigation plan was to engage with research to elaborate further on the concept of carbon neutrality.  We expect that project to commence shortly.  In the meantime, we are continuing to take a three-strand approach to emissions reduction: reducing emissions where we can, increasing carbon sequestration, and displacing fossil fuel and energy intensive materials with renewable sources.<\/p> <p> The sector has been engaging in positive environmental actions, but I will focus in the main on some of the actions that we have taken since I presented last year's transition statement.<\/p> <p> In terms of the rural development plan, we continue to invest in our mitigation measures, with approximately 49,000 farmers active in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and almost 25,000 farmers participating in the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, where in excess of 1 million animals have been genotyped to date.  Building on the success of the BDGP, we will introduce a new pilot scheme in 2019 targeted at suckler farmers, which will be called the beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP.  This new scheme will aim to improve the carbon efficiency of beef production further.<\/p> <p> Given the importance of afforestation to the achievement of sequestration ambitions, one of the new mitigation measures we have identified and introduced this year is a knowledge transfer group, KTG, scheme for forestry.  Other forest measures taken this year include increasing the rate of financial support across all categories, with larger increases for broadleaf planting.  A change in supports for road building was also made.  In addition, we have seen the introduction of the woodland environmental fund, which will help to expand Ireland's native woodland resource further.<\/p> <p> On the energy efficiency side of things, our farmers are availing of investment options like biomass boilers and air source heat pumps under the TAMS II pig and poultry and young farmers capital investment schemes.  This year also saw the launch of a new collaborative initiative between the Government and industry known as the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme.  The Department, Bord Bia and Teagasc are working together on how to effect further positive change at farm level through research, advisory services and carbon audits.<\/p> <p> My Department is busy preparing its first statutory adaptation plan for the three areas identified in the national adaptation framework and for which my Department has responsibility.  The areas are seafood, agriculture and forestry.  We published an adaptation planning document for the agricultural and forestry sectors last year and advanced work on the seafood element, which will set the groundwork for future adaptation planning.<\/p> <p> Increased environmental ambition is a key element of the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, proposals.  I view this as an opportunity.  However, the importance of having a well-funded CAP is more pertinent than ever if we want to see this ambition become a reality.  Our farmers are custodians of the land, so supporting them in good environmental practices and enabling them to respond to climate challenges and opportunities is not only an investment in our agricultural sector but also in wider rural and general communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600022#X00300","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544103600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the past year's progress.  The year went by quickly.  On behalf of myself and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, I reaffirm our Department's commitment to working collaboratively with colleagues across Government so that we can collectively and successfully deliver and implement critical climate mitigation and adaptation actions and measures.<\/p>  <p>  Since our statements last year, we launched Project Ireland 2040 in April.  It is the overarching planning and investment framework for the social, economic and cultural development of Ireland.  It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the period 2018 to 2027 - the &euro;116 billion national development plan, NDP - in support of a long-term transformational spatial strategy, that being, the national planning framework, NPF, with a time horizon out to 2040.  The aligned and shared vision of the NPF in tandem with the NDP represents a joined-up planning and investment strategy for Ireland's future growth and development focused on a series of ten shared national outcomes.  Foremost among these is climate action and the national objective to transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society by 2050.  Policy that will assist in making that transition and meeting our climate obligations is woven through the NPF and the NDP.  Shared outcomes reflected in both documents that are fundamentally supportive of climate action include compact growth, sustainable mobility and sustainable management of waste, water and other environmental resources.  All of these include significant elements of policy that provide a strong platform for the development of measures and actions in response to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  The overall NPF strategy seeks to achieve a better balance of development between the regions and a greater focus on Ireland's cities, supporting Ireland's rural fabric and targeting more compact growth in the development of settlements of all sizes from the largest city to the smallest village.<\/p>  <p>  The NPF includes a number of specific measures.  First, the Department is undertaking a review of the 2006 wind energy development guidelines.  The review is addressing a number of key aspects, including sound or noise, visual amenity, setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections.  We will shortly commence a public consultation on the revised draft guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the strategic environmental assessment process, with the aim of issuing the finalised guidelines following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, which will be in approximately two months.  When finalised, the revised guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  Second, in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which leads on renewable energy policy, my Department is exploring the potential for enhancing national planning guidance on solar energy, which is often the subject of debate in the House, while also taking into account solar energy projects being assessed by planning authorities and the scope for future development of the sector in the context of the ongoing development of renewable energy policy.  Should the need for specific planning guidance for solar farms be identified, this work will be further scoped and progressed.  We do not believe that there is a need for such guidelines currently, but we will keep the matter under review.<\/p>  <p>  We are also progressing the national marine spatial planning framework, which is making its way through the Houses.  It was discussed in the Seanad and by a committee and is currently undergoing a public consultation phase, which will inform the framework.  That plan will align itself with the NPF and we hope to have it completed and published in early 2020.  We will be focusing on it.  I will update the House during next year's statements.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD, approximately 40% of total energy produced in Ireland is used in the building sector.  The directive sets ambitious goals for energy efficiency and renewables in buildings by requiring nearly zero energy building, NZEB, performance for new buildings from 31 December 2020.  In addition, the directive requires that major renovations to existing buildings are completed to a cost-optimal level where feasible.  The implementation of NZEB is a key action for the built environment in contributing to Ireland's national low-carbon transition and mitigation plan.  This has been completed for buildings other than dwellings and will take effect from 1 January 2019.  It is planned to be in place for dwellings from mid-2019.  These will contribute to emissions reductions from 1 January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  A new element of the revised EPBD is the provision of infrastructure for the charging of electric vehicles.  A lack of recharging infrastructure is seen as a barrier to the uptake of electric vehicles in the EU and the revised directive has new provisions that aim to accelerate deployment.  We are in the process of drafting these regulations and will be publishing them for public consultation in 2019.  We will have the regulations in place by March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Under the social housing retrofit programme, local authorities are undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of the Department, on the least energy efficient social homes.  The programme has had two phases.  Phase 1 focused on lower cost improvements such as cavity wall and attic insulation.  Phase 2 is targeting higher cost, deeper retrofit measures, for example, fabric upgrades and glazing.  Since 2013, funding of &euro;120 million has been provided to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in more than 65,000 local authority homes, benefiting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland's carbon emissions and energy reduction targets for 2020.  Potentially, more than 2 million houses are to be addressed in the years ahead.  That will be a focus for us.<\/p>  <p>  I will not go through the issues of water and so on, but I can read the statement out to the House if needs be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600023#Y00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1544103600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to update the House on this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who cannot be present.<\/p>  <p>  Climate change adaptation planning within the health sector is crucial and involves two key areas, those being, the protection of the health and well-being of our population and ensuring the resilience of our health service so that it can continue to operate during severe weather events.

The Department has been represented on the national adaptation steering committee since 2014 and more recently on the Government's high-level climate action steering group chaired by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The health sector has also been represented by a specialist in public health medicine in the HSE at the national adaptation steering committee and a variety of other relevant fora, including the Climate Change Advisory Council adaptation committee.<\/p>  <p>  Vulnerability assessment of the health infrastructure and services is a key component of our planning.  Some of this is already occurring through severe weather planning and emergency management structures in the HSE.  It provides for vulnerability assessment for all services provided by the HSE and will form the basis for the bulk of vulnerability assessment across the sector.  The planning is service and geographically based and overlaps with business continuity planning in many cases.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been preparation and activation of emergency plans followed by lessons learned during the weather events of 2017 and 2018 such as Storm Ophelia, Storm Emma and the heatwave experienced during summer 2018 that will be incorporated in future planning scenarios. Current weather and climate-related risks continue to be assessed.  For example, during severe weather events, there have been dynamic public health risk assessments and public health medical advice developed to protect the public.<\/p>  <p>  Future risk assessment may largely depend on the results of the vulnerability assessment and also on the adaptation actions of other sectors as health impact is mainly an endpoint of the effects of climate change on other sectors.  Adaptation options that are already required to manage current risks are being implemented and will continue to be mainstrearned, monitored and reviewed.  Ongoing business continuity planning will meet some of the requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  Another important action involves assessing current information systems in order to develop appropriate data which is capable of identifying changing patterns of illness and disease related to climate change and to measure and monitor same through health surveillance and investigation.

At the outset, I want to put on the record my genuine disappointment at the lack of other ministerial representation here.  It is not a comment on the quality or abilities of the junior Ministers.  It says a lot about what other Ministers see as their responsibility in terms of their Departments when they cannot show respect for the issue, let alone the House, by being present.  For far too long, the issue of climate change has been foisted on the shoulders of the Minister and Department responsible rather than all Ministers treating it with the level of importance with which it must be treated if we are to have any meaningful impact on reducing our emissions, maintaining temperatures at the desired level and addressing the commitments the Government has already entered into.  The real failure of a joined-up Government approach is evident here.  Notwithstanding the Minister's interest and effort, I feel the failure to have senior Ministers here speaks to that issue in a very strong way.  I could understand how one or two Ministers of State might have to represent a Minister but it was known for a while that this debate would be held here today.  It really is an appalling vista that all of the other Departments just sent their junior person in with a script.  It does not indicate that the Government has finally got to grips with the subject.  I have sympathy for the Minister.  If there is a way of communicating back from this House, it is incumbent on the Taoiseach to pull his Cabinet together.  When he became Taoiseach, he said that climate change would be the biggest issue for him.  He has recently said that broadband would be a priority as well so it seems that whatever the issue of the day is will be a personal crusade for him but we need more than words.  We need action and buy-in from other Departments.<\/p><p>I have listened to the Minister since his appointment and get a real sense that he gets it, that he understands and is committed to addressing this issue.  It has been the same in any Department in which he has worked.  He remains committed but this issue will not be resolved on the shoulders of one committed Minister and the words of a Taoiseach every now and again when he is faced with a question.  It requires action.  Even the scripts that were read into the record today by Ministers of State do not give me any real hope.  There is talk of what we have done and might do - almost taking credit for where we are.  We are in an appalling position.  In fairness, the Minister has identified that.  <\/p><p>I will dwell on some of the comments made by Ministers in the past week as they relate to climate change.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was quoted as saying that the continued delivery of diesel buses was very regrettable.  He sent his junior Minister in here today to tell us that they will continue to buy diesel buses up to the middle of next year.  That does not bode well for where we are trying to go.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action this week that we have not succeeded in breaking the link between economic progress and emissions in the industry, agricultural and transport sectors and that by 2020, the year by which we have a target to reduce emissions to 20%, we will only have reduced emissions by 1%.  To me, these words were a sign that the Minister got it.  I welcome these frank admissions and believe they are appropriate.  However, we are past the point where Ministers can be communicators or bemoan the lack of progress.  To quote Joseph Curtin from the Institute of International and European Affairs, &quot;we don't need more analysis, we need leadership.&quot;  The Ministers are responsible for driving that change.  If today's presentations tell us anything, it is that we are back to the case of them being followers of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which does not speak well for what we need to do in the coming months.  <\/p><p>With a few exceptions, all of us in this House have become exceedingly good at talking the talk with regard to climate change.  The narrative put forward is that we will do it better in the future but we are running out of time because the future is upon us.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been clear.  The report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities.  This action needs to be taken within 12 years.  There is a narrow window in which this must happen and I do not get the impression that the Government as a whole has any sense of direction in that regard.  It requires us meeting our targets; we have discussed the failure to meet 2020 targets <i>ad nauseum<\/i>and indeed have acknowledged that we cannot have this same discussion a decade from now.  I would argue that we cannot have this discussion this time next year.  We need to see significant actions taken during that period of time.  <\/p><p>This means that the policies and legislation for the step change which needs to take place is required immediately.  There is a false economy in the prospect of putting off these measures.  Short-term compliance costs to try to close the gap are now likely to be in excess of &euro;100 million.  Ireland is also exposed to significant fines post-2020 and the purchase costs associated with the purchase of the credits and beyond.  This would be far better invested in meeting targets than paying the cost for the failure to invest.<\/p> <p> A number of actions should be taken next year to put Ireland on the correct trajectory.  The development of a competing plan, as announced by the Minister, is a cause for some concern.  It is important that this does not interfere with or supersede the report of the all-party committee.  I hope the Minister will make a commitment today that this will not take place and the recommendations of the committee will be implemented as a priority in any future plans developed by Departments.<\/p> <p> On the legislation which underpins today's statements, there is significant room for improvement.  I produced the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Emissions Targets) 2018 Bill, which sets specific targets.  Having listened to the Minister's comments on my legislation, I am prepared to work with him to set binding targets in domestic legislation that will advance matters.<\/p> <p> What occurred in budget 2020 on carbon tax was deeply disappointing.  We want any moneys raised through future carbon taxes to be used for the decarbonisation of the economy, rather than being allowed to fall into the black hole of the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600024#Z00800","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is probably one of the most important days in the current D&aacute;il when we assess the current position through annual transition statements on climate change.  I welcome the Minister's open and honest statement yesterday at the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  It indicated that he is trying to grapple with these issues and is showing commitment and energy.  That none of the other senior Ministers are present is disappointing.  A procession of Ministers of State read out statements on the Ministers' behalf.  It reminded me of four or five lads standing at the back of the chapel during mass, talking about the match and what went on the night before in the pub and the scandal in the neighbourhood.  They would watch the people in front of them and every time the people in front of them, who were participating, stood up or sat down, the lads would follow suit before continuing to talk.  In other words, they were present but not actually part of the game.  It is disappointing that this is also the case today. <\/p>  <p>  Figures were released this week from the United Nations Climate Action Conference that show exactly the catastrophic nature of what we are facing.  The Minister admitted that we are falling 95% short of our emission reduction targets.  It is shocking that we are failing to meet all our targets to address climate change.  While I welcome the slight decrease in carbon emissions this year, we have a huge distance to make up.<\/p>  <p>  As a small island, there is a question as to whether Ireland should bother.  We have a responsibility to our children and grandchildren to act.  We have a responsibility to the population of the world, particularly countries such as the Philippines that are vulnerable to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  We should not see climate change as a burden.  The Minister is a former Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and we should see this as an opportunity to create long-term sustainable jobs.  Decoupling economic growth and development from increased greenhouse gas emissions is exactly what is required.  We need to talk about long-term jobs in biogas and biomass and we need to create opportunities.  We also need more apprentices.  Even if we find money tomorrow morning, who will carry out the work that is required?  We need skilled personnel to do it, which means training apprentice carpenters, plumbers, electricians and plasterers.<\/p>  <p>  We have opportunities to create security of energy supply on this island.  We import almost &euro;5 billion worth of fossil fuels every year.  We now have an opportunity to address that and turn it around.  We need to use our semi-State companies to achieve this.  Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB and Coillte can form the backbone for providing employment opportunities in this area in the time ahead, much as semi-State companies did in the past.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing carbon emissions covers many different areas and will require many changes in planning, developing new crops, reducing waste and recycling and reducing more of the waste we produce.  It will require changes in training, developing new scholarships and apprenticeships.  We must also move ahead with large schemes in biomass and biogas.<\/p>  <p>  To date, political will has been lacking in this area.   Shortly after his appointment, the Taoiseach made climate change one of his priorities.  I welcomed that because I had been banging the drum on this issue for years with two previous Ministers with responsibility for the environment, Deputies Phil Hogan and Alan Kelly.  Based on the evidence to date, we have not moved a long distance.  Many of the key players involved in the energy sector and climate change, including those operating the electricity grid and regulating the industry, as well as energy suppliers and the Government, have failed to show vision or energy.  The energy types of the near future will be very different and the power systems of the future will use very different energy sources.  Last week, I brought before the House a Bill on microgeneration, a technology that will play some part in broadening the portfolio of energy sources available.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, when the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill was going through the D&aacute;il, I said we needed to set sectoral targets.  That remains the case because if we do not set targets, we will not reach them.  In response to my Bill last week, the Minister indicated that a money message might be necessary.  That is not the case.  I deliberately drafted the legislation in such a way as to ensure it would not necessitate a money message.  I do not want the Government to hold up the Bill for that reason.  I want it to go to committee and to be progressed.  It is an honest attempt to try to address microgeneration, an area that we have not moved on in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has taken some action, but they are baby steps at best.  The lack of action in renewable energy has been staggering.  Our offshore wind resources are among the best in Europe but we have little in place to take advantage of it.  There is just one wind farm off the coast of Arklow.  There is great potential in offshore wind and we have much ground to make up.<\/p>  <p>  While it is good that peat plants are converting to biomass, we are not establishing a native biomass industry to create the supply chains required.  Instead, amazingly, we wind up importing fuel from across the globe to power these plants.  This could be an income stream for farmers and a job creator in the midlands.  Failing to act in this area demonstrates a lack of vision.  If the Minister does one thing in his term in office, he should work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to push this issue.  It is a pity the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is not present as I would like to hear what he has to say on the matter.  His absence is very disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  Our large agriculture sector means we have one of the best biogas resources in the European Union.  Again, we have hardly developed that resource and we must move ahead with it.  We must have at least 500,000 electric cars on the road by 2030.  Considering the tiny number we have to date, albeit one that is improving, we must move ahead with this technology very quickly.  There is a welcome commitment for &euro;100 million for cycleways.  The Minister must involve local authorities in this because without them, these facilities will not be developed.<\/p>  <p>  Steps have been taken, but we must improve and work quicker.  There must be political will from this House to drive it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600025#AA00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I express my disappointment that there are not senior Ministers present for this discussion on such a vital topic.  Nobody would deny that the Minister is absolutely committed to addressing climate change.  His integrity in respect of the issue is beyond question.  His interaction with the Joint Committee on Climate Action was one of quality and there was a clear commitment on his part to seek to tackle climate change in a systematic way.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, there are certain obligations under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  That is why we are having these statements today.  The Act prescribes that details on emissions, inventories and projections should be published.  We did not hear from the Minister or Ministers of State clearly defined projections as to how they proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  We are now at the stage where the annual transition statement is disconcerting in how it depicts a lot of positive action, without stating clearly how far this country is off course in tackling climate change.  We are moving in the wrong direction in climate pollution.  Emissions are rising, rather than falling, contrary to all targets, legal obligations and political commitments.  Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Ireland agreed to cut emissions by 5% per annum from 2018 until 2050.<\/p><p>Ireland is one of just two EU member states that will not meet these commitments.  There is without question a need for radical action.  We have to see a greater sense of urgency from the Government in dealing with the challenges we face.  It must involve a clear policy on carbon budgets.  Secretaries General have come before the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  It has to be said that, in the case of most Departments, there is no sense of urgency about a set of mitigation policies that would contribute to the cutting of emissions.  It was made clear in the recent special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that we had a narrow window of opportunity to enable global warming to stabilise gradually at 1.5&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.  It has been well articulated that this will require unprecedented changes within the next 12 years.  We have to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 45% from 2010 levels by 2030.  We have to transition to net zero emissions globally by around 2050.<\/p> <p> According to the Minister, the EPA is in the process of updating its projections for greenhouse gas emissions to reflect the impact of a higher level of policy ambition.  For example, the climate action commitments contained in the national development plan are being factored in.  I think we need to see that happen sooner rather than later.  We need to ensure that when this Parliament reports on the findings of the Citizens' Assembly, the policy outcomes that will result from the assembly's recommendations are more radical than, or at least equal to, those recommendations.  We need to see more radical action at community level in respect of the potential to use wind energy and for the deep retrofitting of houses.  Communities need to be helped to own and buy into energy projects.  As we have articulated at the joint committee, there are numerous possibilities to do things across the agriculture and environment sectors, as well as others.  They can be measured.  Programmes should be under way within the next three months.  If we do not start to act on a quarterly basis, with proper metrics and proper targeting, we will be using the same language again this time next year.<\/p> <p> As the economy grows, there will be challenges.  For example, the effect of increases in greenhouse gas emissions will need to be offset.  The only way to do it is by ensuring the funds readily available to the Government are used in a way that will facilitate people on the ground who want to take radical action.  It is clear from the report of the Citizens' Assembly that people are of a mind to take radical action.  We need to put in place policies that will be backed up by proper funding and allow people to start to take action at all levels, down to community level.  That means transitioning away from diesel and petrol vehicles towards electric vehicles and providing for the deep retrofitting of older housing stock, to mention just two examples of something that could be done in a very short space of time with some energy and commitment.  If we are all here this time next year, when the country is meeting its obligations under the annual transition statement, we will need to give greater political urgency to this matter.  By this time next year, we must ensure we will have reached a set of targets collectively and in a non-partisan way that will enable us to say we are seeing clear evidence of a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  If we do not achieve these targets, we will be on a hiding to nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600025#AA00300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544105400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>When David Attenborough spoke at the climate summit in Poland earlier this week, he summed up very well the situation the world was facing.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change.  If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world are on the horizon.<\/blockquote><p>In fact, the extinction of much of the natural world is not just on the horizon, it has already taken place.  The devastating consequences of human action organised on the basis of capitalism, including debt and hunger on a mass scale, are already evident.  I suggest the most powerful statement heard in Poland this week was made by a 15 year old Swedish school student, Greta Thunberg.  She has been on a school student strike since August, at first all week and subsequently for one day a week.  Over 20,000 school students around the world have participated in the strike.  She spoke powerfully about this issue.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>Since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago ... We have to understand what the older generation has dealt to us, what mess they have created that we have to clean up and live with.  We have to make our voices heard ... For 25 years, countless people have come to the UN climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions and clearly that has not worked as emissions are continuing to rise.  So I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future.  I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not.<\/blockquote><p>That sums it up for me.  It also sums up the situation we face in Ireland.<\/p><p>The outcome of the deliberations of the Citizens' Assembly's on this issue, like the outcome of its deliberations on the repeal of the eighth amendment, has demonstrated that ordinary people are far ahead of establishment politicians on issues such as the environment.  I remind the House that 100% of the members of the assembly voted in favour of the State taking a leadership role in tackling climate change, 97% voted in favour of the establishment of a new independent body to ensure climate change would be at the centre of policy making and 92% voted in favour of prioritising investment in public transport over investment in road infrastructure.  The Government and the political establishment are continuing to fiddle while the planet burns.  Their rhetoric is not backed up by any action.  This is reflected in the fact that Ireland is second to last in the European Union in meeting targets.  It is also reflected in the EPA's projections which show that we will achieve a 1% reduction by 2020, even though our reduction target is 20%.  If the world's leaders, including the Government, are left to their own devices, they will continue on the road to absolute disaster.<\/p><p>I would like to speak about three biggest areas when it comes to emissions.  Precious little is being done in the agriculture sector.  The Government is not interested in touching the vested interests in areas such as agribusiness.  There is a need for incentives to facilitate a radical shift away from agriculture based on dairy farming.<\/p><p>Nothing is being done in the transport sector.  The Government bangs on about electric cars, but they are not the answer because they cause loads of problems.  The processes used to extract the rare earth elements needed for electric vehicles are causing significant environmental problems in China.  Instead, a different model of transport is needed.  Fundamentally, we need a public transport model.  The process being driven by the Government is furthering privatisation in the transport sector.  It should be investing in public transport.  The Luxembourg Government announced yesterday that it would make public train and bus travel free across that country.  It follows its counterpart in Estonia in taking such an approach.  If the Government were serious about tackling climate change, it would announce that Ireland was next.<\/p><p>In the energy sector the Government is objecting and seeking to block the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 and the Prohibition of Fossil Fuels (Keep it in the Ground) Bill 2017 which are before the committee.  The aim of the legislation is to block the further extraction of fossil fuels.  There is no significant investment in renewable energy resources, even though it is clear that public investment is needed.  The development of the Shannon LNG terminal is a further example of investment in fossil fuel infrastructure at a time when we need to be moving away from such infrastructure as part of a rapid and just transition to a zero carbon based economy.  Two thirds of the gas that will be imported for the Shannon LNG terminal will be fracked gas from the United States which comes with various extra problems.<\/p><p>My conclusion is that we need a mass movement on this issue.  That movement needs to be armed with an eco-socialist programme.  It is only by taking the profits of the vested interests - big oil and gas producers and car manufacturers - out of the agenda and only on the basis of public investment, public ownership and democratic planning that we can take the drastic action we need to turn our world around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600026#BB00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1544105400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>It is clear from the most recent EPA figures that there has almost been zero movement on the issue of climate action in Ireland and that the policies being lauded as achieving progress are actually making things worse.  Contrary to the views of the chief scientific adviser, business as usual cannot continue if we want to tackle global warming.  There is no technological fix.<\/p><p>Endless and exponential growth is incompatible with the survival of the human species.  Natural gas is not a bridge fuel to a cleaner future.  The sustainable expansion of the dairy herd is impossible.  Burning wood for energy is not carbon neutral.  Rail, not roads, are the future of clean transport.  Electric cars are not the solution as long as they primarily run on oil, gas, peat and coal.  The concept of biogas is a laughing stock among the scientific community.  It was difficult to listen to Mary Robinson go unchallenged on \"Morning Ireland\" as she towed the Government line on the issue of climate change.  <\/p> <p> Agriculture is so bad that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been massaging the numbers.  In June 2018, he tried to make out the improved efficiency in the dairy sector meant even though the herd increased by 22% between 2012 and 2016, emissions had increased by only 8%.  In reality, total agricultural emissions were up by 8% in this period and dairy emissions were up by 24%.  It means the millions we spend on efficiency and research in the dairy sector have produced no improvements since 2009.  Beef and dairy are the most polluting and water intensive protein sources on the planet.  They promote food insecurity.  Our agricultural emissions are rising.  We grow very few vegetables and little organic food.  Our water and rivers are polluted.  The fish, bees and insects are dying and the Government is doing very little to address these issues.  Even Bord Bia's Origin Green programme is packed full of some of the worst polluters in the country.  <\/p> <p> Transport saw a 2.4% increase in 2017 after four successive years of increases.  There are no hybrid or electric buses in Ireland and we are about to see almost 200 more filthy diesel buses come on the scene.  The Government has been talking about using compressed natural gas in trucks and buses, shutting down rail lines and building more roads for cars.  The housing crisis is making people commute from further and further away.  For many the cost, dearth of services and lack of frequency of services makes driving the only choice.  We are well behind on adopting electric cars.  However, until we further decarbonise our electricity, it is not the worst of our problems.  Moneypoint has been shut down for over two months now, supplying only 3% of the island's electricity through the burning of gas.  Seeing that we are getting by just fine without burning coal, why are we considering firing up the turbines again for another six years?  The plan to convert our peat and coal plants to burn woody biomass and gas is a disaster for global warming.  Woody biomass is not carbon neutral.  It is a highly inefficient mode of power generation that releases stored carbon into the atmosphere.  Even under the most well managed forestry regime, it will not be recaptured for at least 50 years.  We do not have 50 years; we have 12.  All around Europe new gas terminals are being built by US companies and financed by the EU.  The Government is spinning the fraudulent nonsense that gas is a transition fuel to renewable gas.  The US national security adviser John Bolton, is screaming that the EU has to stop buying evil Russian gas and should be buying it from saintly Israel and the US in the interest of global freedom and so-called democracy.  Royal Dutch Shell invented the idea of gas as a bridge fuel in 2001.  Nearly 20 years later we are saying the same thing while globally gas production is sky-rocketing.  Natural gas is a filthy fossil fuel.  Many scientific studies have shown that over its life cycle shale gas is as detrimental to global warming as coal.  This is why we are building infrastructure and planning to put commercial vehicles on our power plants.  <\/p> <p> The Government is working for the extraction industry, which is destroying the planet, and not for the people who are suffering as a result.  It is not just perpetuating an injustice on the Irish who will suffer tomorrow as a result of this inaction.  The global south, which pollutes the least, is suffering right now from starvation, drought, extreme weather events, forced migration and debt.  What is worse, our tax haven status allows us to rob the global south twice.  In 2012, the last year we have figures for, $2 trillion flowed into developing countries from the global north in aid, investment and loans.  The same year, $5 trillion flowed from the south to the north.  The worst problems were illicit tax flows to tax havens in countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg.  I am not shooting the Minister.  He just got the job.  It will be great if he will be able to make a difference.  I feel sorry for the Minister having to listen to the likes of Labour Party Deputies who did nothing for five years talking about climate change now.  I wish the Minister well.

In the past seven or eight years, 400,000 more people are working in Ireland.  If we put wings on them, we will have a bigger carbon footprint.  We have to make sure whatever measures are introduced do not hit people the wrong way, especially those from the poorer sections of our community.  Many things can be done to help income.  Unfortunately the dairy sector has grown in parts of the country.  The Department's plan was to get rid of the beef industry because it is on its knees and to try to plant the west of Ireland.  If Fine Gael continues on the road of previous Governments of giving big landlord farmers &euro;140,000 and &euro;150,000 in CAP funding and giving small farmers &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000, it will destroy the west of Ireland.  We have asked for somebody to come forward.  I would like to talk to the people who do the figures.  I ask the Minister to facilitate it.  Many farmers around the country have many trees that are not even accounted for.  A tree audit needs to be done to make sure we are not missing out.  We are not doing what we need to do.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, like previous Governments, is aiding and abetting feedlots around the country, some of them with 35,000 cattle and absolutely no land to back it up.  One always had at least an acre of land for an animal.  We had a Bill on microgeneration.  There has been push-back on it.  <\/p>  <p>  I listen to people who talk about the environment, global warming and climate change.  Last weekend about 400 people attended an event.  I checked the figures for air travel.  Will we look at the idea of whether we need to go on planes all the time?  How much carbon are they creating?  There seems to be a focus on rural Ireland and a suggestion that it is the polluter of the world.  Whether people like it or not, they will have to eat meat and vegetables will be produced.  Rural Ireland will need to survive.  Rural Ireland is doing its part.  Much can be done through Government initiatives.  We talked about biogas and anaerobic digesters.  A drying system would help save water.  When planning permission is submitted, environmentalists object.  For years we have listened to the debate about importing &euro;6 billion worth of fossil fuels.  The reality is we were told Bord na M&oacute;na is closing down.  What will we do?  We will bring biomass in from Africa, Brazil and other countries.  Evaluation is required.  If one considers the situation concerning nitrates allowances, most farmers use only 60% to 70% of their nitrates allowance.  The big barons are given derogations.  A two-pronged approach is required.  It is doing harm to the family farm.  We will solve nothing if we do not concentrate on the traditionally farmed family farm and forget about landlordism, which is where we are headed, aided and abetted by Government incentives.  The west of Ireland will not become the dumping ground for the carbon of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600027#CC00500","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1544106000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>David Attenborough's words at COP24 earlier this week echoed around the world when he stated that the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.  Regrettably the Government is full of announcements and plans and we have seen very little real action.  Senior Ministers cannot even be bothered to turn up for these statements.  It shows their complete lack of interest in the most urgent challenge facing humanity.  Sometimes I feel my eight year old daughter has more interest in and shows more climate change action than some of the Ministers in the Government.  It is the children who are born now who will be affected.  We are not talking about our grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  It is children who are born now who will suffer.<\/p><p>The Government's national mitigation plan has 41 actions due for 2018, yet 20 of them are reported in the annual transition statement as not having been completed.  The Government's national development plan, the vaunted Project Ireland 2040, was not even climate proofed.  All the while, the Government's progress in decreasing our emissions towards the targets we have committed to has been glacially slow.  It has been dragged kicking and screaming into even the tiniest of climate action measures.  The Government's rhetoric keeps getting stronger and louder, but its actions continue to fail, as exemplified by the determination to build a third runway at Dublin Airport, build even more motorways across the country and extract more oil and gas from our seas.<br\/><br\/>The Environmental Protection Agency's emissions statistics released yesterday show that while our overall greenhouse gas emissions decreased marginally from 2016 to 2017, they are not falling fast enough.  This change, which is less than 1%, can be primarily attributed to the reduced use of Moneypoint power station and a warm winter in 2017, rather than any new policy measures from Government.  The bottom line is that we are way off target.<br\/><br\/>It is not all doom and gloom.  There is a path and there are actions that can be taken if there is the political will and courage to take them.  We need political courage from everyone in this House to call for and agree on a path for our country.  There is no room for populist politics in the real climate action that is needed.  The Government needs to make a seismic shift from concentration on road infrastructure to focusing on spending on public transport and walking and cycling infrastructure.  It needs to invest in real alternatives to cars in cities and rural areas.  The Government needs to focus on a sustainable model of land use based on diversification, food security, carbon efficiency and the protection of biodiversity, rather than focusing solely on agriculture that seeks to meet demand for its own sake.  We must protect small farmers, young farmers and family farmers.  This is essential not only for the environment but also to provide a fairer living for farmers, instead of maintaining a<i>status quo<\/i>that is catered to and serves only the big meat processors and retailers at the cost of the small farmer.<br\/><br\/>The Government needs to provide real opportunities for people who want to be green and to save energy.  It is the Minister's job to make it easy for us to be green.  He needs to fast-track Sinn F&eacute;in's Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill in order that those who want to invest in solar panels can be paid back for their investment while supplying the grid with clean energy.  The Government needs to stop blocking my party's Waste Reduction Bill.<br\/><br\/>I strongly believe the people of Ireland want to make a real change.  The Citizens' Assembly findings showed just how willing and eager Irish people are to turn this into a country that leads on climate action instead of one that is left behind.  Despite the Citizens' Assembly and the community organisations and businesses throughout the country that are focused on building a better, cleaner, greener future, it is sadly becoming ever more difficult for even the most ardent optimists among us to believe that this Government has any intention of sincerely tackling climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600027#CC00600","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544106600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for participating in this debate.  We had a good exchange, as some of the Deputies acknowledged, for two and a half hours yesterday in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  That committee, as the House will be aware, has been appointed to report back by the end of January on how we should respond to the various reports on climate change, including the report of the Citizens' Assembly.  It will also report on the reality that every Deputy has recognised that we are 95% off the target that was set.  The truth is that when the economy started to recover, the structural changes that we needed in our economy had not been made.  That is reflected in the consistent numbers, particularly for agriculture, industry and transport.  Even in areas such as the public service, for which we are directly responsible, the figures presented in yesterday's report were also bad.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the joint committee is doing this work.  I view the committee as a major ally in persuading the wider public of the importance of what we are trying to do here.  I hope we can achieve an all-party consensus on some of the issues to which everyone knows we must face up.  The Green Party and the Taoiseach have signalled the importance of having in place a carbon price trajectory if people are to make the right decisions about the sort of infrastructure to which they commit in their own lives.  They will be locked into a high-carbon intensity if we do not make the right decisions.  For instance, every vehicle on the road today will be replaced by 2030.  The decisions that are made on what replaces them will be very important in that sector.  The vast majority of homes have energy ratings of D and worse.  Together we must find a way to make the required transition in the residential sector, either through community initiatives or smart-funding packages because the State cannot fund the &euro;50 billion that will be needed.  We have serious challenges across all sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace, whom I respect greatly in much of what he says, tried to project that the policies that have been adopted are getting us nowhere.  That is an unfair assessment.  Yesterday's numbers for 2017 reflected a bad outcome but the same projections by the same people show that the impact of policies will result in a significant increase in renewable energy.  As the Deputy correctly stated, renewables are at the heart of the matter.  Our electricity system will increase use of renewables from 30% to 55%.  Our emissions will fall cumulatively by 22 million tonnes, closing approximately half of the gap that we must meet as a result of the NDP.  We are making progress but it is simply not enough.  There is no point - I am not talking about Deputy Wallace - in coming in and lecturing us as if nothing is happening, while not putting forward initiatives that can help us move it on.  We must have an honest debate.<\/p>  <p>  Some developments are very good but we need to accelerate them.  We cannot fund some other changes.  Many Deputies appear to believe that the State can fund all the change required, whether in agriculture, residential buildings or small business.  The State cannot fund it all.  This is about behavioural change and we all have to change.  Every one of us, from the citizen and the enterprise to the public service, has to take this seriously.  It will be important that we do so.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley, who is no longer present, correctly emphasised the economic opportunities and new apprenticeships that can be developed.  He also noted the changing face of energy and its implications for enterprise and the importance of microgeneration.  These are important elements but there is another side to this issue.  Deputy Stanley was remarkably silent on the challenge that both the Taoiseach and the leader of the Green Party put up to the House, namely, that we agree on a carbon price trajectory.  If we are serious about it, that will be a significant element.  There is no point in sticking our heads in the sand about the introduction of a carbon price.  The ESRI, which many respect and quote, has stated carbon pricing could result in a 10% reduction in emissions from transport.  It has shown what the impact would be right across various sectors.  It has also shown that its impact would be greater on rich families than on poor families.  Analysis has been done that show carbon pricing is not an unfair way of tackling climate change.<\/p>  <p>  A carbon price also creates proceeds.  Many Deputies correctly stated that the use of those proceeds must be seen to be fair, must be spread across the entire community and must address what many refer to as a just transition.  We must ensure that regions or sectors that are particularly disrupted receive some of these resources to help them make the move to the new sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice, who is no longer here, made an interesting point that aeroplanes and ships are not counted.  That is undoubtedly partly because 80% of the output of agriculture, the sector the Deputy was defending, is exported.  The exclusion of planes and ships from the EU counting is related to it being a trading nation.<\/p><p> Deputy Wallace said transition fuels are fraudulent.  Others say we should keep everything in the ground.  The truth is that even in the most optimistic scenarios there will be use of fossil fuels.  Our choice really is whether we are dependent on Russian or Arab sources for them or whether we allow some to come from domestic sources.  While climate change is really important, energy security is also important.  We have to take a balanced approach.<\/p> <p> I agree with many speakers who have said that we need to do a great deal more.  Even the national development plan will only get us half way there.  We need to deliver it and underpin it with many micro policies that make the difference.  That is the work I have to do.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for wishing me well.  Even those critical of what the Government is doing have generally wished me a fair wind in seeking to evolve policy in this area.  I look forward to working with Deputies across the House.  There is no doubt that this cannot be delivered by Government.  There is no solution in Adelaide Road no more than in Merrion Street that will solve this.  This has to be solved by engagement right across our community.  That is one thing we will have to work on in particular.  This is about far more than economics and economic tools.  I am familiar with economic tools.  They are part of the familiar toolbox of public policy but they will not be enough.  Those who spoke about engaging with communities and getting bottom-up initiatives are absolutely right.  This will not happen by top-down change; it has to be a partnership.  It will be difficult to forge because none of this is easy.  If it were easy, it would have been done long ago &ndash; that is the reality.  This is difficult stuff.  We have to persuade people to do things differently.  Yet, the prize is extraordinary.<\/p> <p> I will go back to this point.  This was very much underlined in Katowice during the week.  I hope to be back there next week to see a rulebook concluded in the final negotiations.  One point made there was stark.  I have said it previously and I repeat it now.  The window is closing quickly for us to do anything about this.  We have an opportunity now.  If we let this slip while we are in a position to address it, we will have seriously failed the next generation and failed in our responsibilities to people who are far poorer than we are.<\/p> <p> The second point is more encouraging.  Most of the technologies we need are either developed or in development.  We are not asking an impossible thing.  The transition will be difficult but at the end of the transition we will have a better more connected community, a healthier way of living and a better management of the scarce resources of the earth that we are responsible for husbanding.  There is an incredible prize as well as major challenge at stake.  I hope that by working together with all Members, especially those of the all-party Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action and Environment, we can come forward with a package that will not only draw substantial support but also impact on the major changes we have to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600028#DD00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018: Order for Report Stage","time":1544107200,"counter":269,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600029#EE00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1544107200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600029#EE00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544107200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018: Report and Final Stages","time":1544107200,"counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600029#EE00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1544107200,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Thankfully we have few amendments.

On foot of that consideration and an amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty relating to the inclusion of mediation as one of the settlement channels detailed in section 4, I agreed that I would propose an amendment on behalf of Government to include mediation as a potential settlement channel to be recorded.<\/p><p>According to the 2017 Mediation Act, &quot;mediation&quot; means a confidential facilitative and voluntary process in which parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a mediator, attempt to reach a mutually acceptable agreement to resolve the dispute.

The majority of the gap lies elsewhere as currently we have no information on direct settlements by insurers or on settlements on the steps of the court.  This is primarily what we are trying to address since there is a view that claimants may get up to 70% of awards.  However there is no certainty around this as it may vary from company to company and there is no overall industry perspective on the matter.<\/p><p>One of the key purposes of collecting claims data by settlement channel is to give greater insight into how costs and awards differ depending on method of settlement.  Insurers have expressed concerns that the publication of this information, in particular the settlement amounts made, may drive particular behaviours among claimants.  The matter needs to be considered carefully by the Central Bank.  While these concerns are being considered, the Central Bank will not be precluded from collecting such information.<\/p><p>The amendment offered today makes good on my commitment on Committee Stage and is relatively straightforward.

The Bill was initiated in the D&aacute;il on 6 November.  <\/p><p>This is a short technical Bill which has the important objective of increasing the statutory limit on the cumulative capital outlay, commitments and liabilities that can be advanced to Screen Ireland, formerly known as the Irish Film Board, from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.  As in the case of some statutory bodies which receive public funding, a limit was set by statute on such outlays when the Irish Film Board Act 1980 was passed.  The limit must be reviewed by the Houses of the Oireachtas every five to six years.  In this way, the Oireachtas can monitor cumulative capital funding to this statutory body each time the limit needs to be increased.  Since the Irish Film Board Act 1980 was first passed, the funding limit has been adjusted upwards on five occasions.  The Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act 2011 increased the limit to &euro;300 million and it is now proposed to increase the limit to &euro;500 million to allow Screen Ireland to continue to operate within an appropriate statutory limit.  When the total 2018 capital allocation of &euro;14.2 million is drawn down, it will reach &euro;295.86 million and the limit permitted within the legislation will have almost been reached.  The 2019 capital allocation would breach the statutory limit in the absence of new legislation.  Accordingly, I am very keen to advance the process of amending the legislation to increase the aggregate figure further.  <\/p><p>The proposal to increase the limit on advances is an enabling provision.  The funding of Screen Ireland is, of course, subject to the normal Estimates procedures.  Screen Ireland is the national development agency for Irish film making and the Irish film, television and animation industry and works within the framework of the Irish Film Board Acts 1980 to 2011.  Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  It supports these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects.  I am pleased to report that &euro;20.04 million is to be allocated to Screen Ireland in budget 2019, an increase of &euro;2 million on the figure for 2018.  I am also glad to report that budget 2019 included an announcement that section 481, the Irish tax incentive for film, television and animation, had been extended to 2024.  A time-limited regional uplift of 5% is also being introduced for the film tax relief.<\/p><p>Evidence of the necessity for this legislation is borne out by the activity of Screen Ireland in recent times.  In the period since 2011, it has assisted the development of a total of 140 feature film projects, 120 documentaries and 30 animation projects.  It has also supported over 140 projects for distribution and seen the development of 700 projects in the period.  My Department recently commissioned international audiovisual consultants Olsberg-SPI with Nordicity to examine the sector. Its report entitled, Economic Analysis of the Audiovisual Sector in the Republic of Ireland<i>, <\/i>was published last June.  The consultants measured the economic value of the audiovisual industry and made recommendations to support its future growth.  The report showed that the audiovisual sector had contributed &euro;1.05 billion to Ireland&rsquo;s economy in 2016 and supported employment of 16,930 full-time equivalents, of whom 10,560 were in direct employment.  The largest contribution to employment came from the film, television and animation sub-sector which generated 11,960 full-time equivalent jobs, of whom just over 7,000 were in direct employment, including cast and crew.  The report confirms that the audiovisual sector supports thousands of jobs in Ireland and that there is significant potential for further growth in the years ahead.  <\/p><p>Government investment is vital to build on the many success stories I have outlined.  In April this year I was joined by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in launching the Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage plan for the period 2018 to 2027.  It is an overarching capital investment plan which proposes funding of &euro;200 million for the audiovisual industry and media production through Screen Ireland in the next ten years.  The subsequent audiovisual action plan which I launched last June as part of the Creative Ireland programme has the potential not only to increase the number of full-time industry employees to an estimated 24,000 but also to grow its gross value to nearly &euro;1.4 billion.  The plan is informed by the aforementioned Olsberg-SPI with Nordicity report which sets out a detailed economic analysis of the audiovisual sector and provides an invaluable framework for the growth of the industry in the coming years.  A steering group has been set up which will prioritise measures, oversee implementation and monitor risks and report regularly to me as Minister.  <\/p><p>Screen Ireland aims to support and promote Irish film, television and animation through fostering Irish artistic vision and our diverse creative and production talent, growing audiences and attracting film makers and investment into the country.  Recent years were significant for Irish creative talent and the screen industries, not only for the commercial and critical plaudits of Irish film both at home and abroad but also its breakthrough onto the international stage.  In terms of international recognition, the Irish film and screen industries have been recognised in the last decade, with 20 Academy Award nominations since 2008, with three wins; nine Golden Globe nominations since 2008, with one win; 17 Emmy Award nominations since 2008, with seven wins; and nine films at the Cannes Film Festival since 2007, with three wins.  There has also been a consistent presence at major international festivals such as the Sundance, Berlinale, Tribeca and Toronto festivals.  In the past few years Irish talent has been a consistent presence at the Academy Awards ceremony, with Nora Twomey&rsquo;s debut animated feature, &quot;The Breadwinner&quot;, leading the Irish charge at recent ceremonies, alongside other nominations of Irish talent, including Saoirse Ronan, Consolata Boyle, Martin McDonagh and Daniel Day-Lewis.  The industry&rsquo;s current flourishing is the result of years of investment in creative film making talent by Screen Ireland.  <\/p><p>Screen Skills Ireland is a division of Screen Ireland and the national training and development resource specifically created for the film and television industry.Screen Skills Ireland is investing in people and skills and has developed and delivered over 60 courses and provided training for 1,558 individuals in 2017.  Targeted and strategic training has been developed for the animation sector which is growing at an exponential rate.  In addition, work based learning initiatives grew through participation in &quot;Red Rock&quot; and &quot;Nightflyers&quot;, the VFX animation traineeship, the graduate traineeship programme and the new assistant traineeship in Kilkenny with Cartoon Saloon supported by SOLAS.  It is fair to say Screen Ireland has undergone major change and development, both domestically and internationally, in recent years.  Its vision is of a vibrant, creative and sustainable film, television and animation industry, with diverse voices, talent and opportunities.  It speaks to and connects Irish film culture with audiences at home and abroad.<\/p><p>Screen Ireland is committed to addressing the issue of gender inequality in film making and screen content, in particular the roles of writers and directors.  It will work towards achieving the target of 50:50 gender parity by 2020 in creative talent working in screen content.  I am glad to report that there was a significant increase of 62% in the number of applications received, with female talent included, and an 82% increase in funding awards with female talent attached in 2018 when compared to the 2017 figures.  Screen Ireland works with the industry towards ensuring dignity in the workplace in a number of ways across training and industry support.  In response to reports of harassment in the audiovisual industry and in the light of the growing Me Too movement, Screen Ireland issued a statement highlighting its policy of zero tolerance towards the abuse of power within the workplace aimed at empowering industry practitioners to speak out against any abuse of power that they may experience within their own industry.  In an increasingly competitive international environment I am glad to say Screen Ireland has been able to continue to effectively discharge its vital role of promoting the indigenous film industry and marketing Ireland as a location for international productions.  <\/p><p>Our cultural and artistic identity as a nation gives us a competitive advantage that now more than ever must be exploited.<\/p><p>As I have stated, the benefits of high levels of film and television production in Ireland will include increased international investment in the economy, increased employment in the sector, positive spin-off effects on the promotion of Ireland as a tourist location, and the improvement of Ireland as an industrial location for all aspects of creative endeavours.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the Deputies' co-operation in expediting the enactment of this short and technical but very important Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600030#FF00200","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544108400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will support this Bill.  As is the case with some statutory bodies that receive public funding, a limit was set by statute on such outlay, in this case when the Irish Film Board Act 1980 was enacted.  The limit must be updated by the Houses of the Oireachtas every few years.  The Bill is technical in nature and will allow F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann to raise the ceiling of the aggregated support provided to the film industry to &euro;500 million.  In recent years the Irish production sector has expanded in a positive way.  This is a result of a number of big-budget TV dramas produced in Ireland, which started with \"The Tudors\" more than a decade ago.  As a result, Ireland is the 17th most popular location in the world for filming TV shows and movies according to a recent study.  Considering the size of Ireland by comparison with some countries which ranked higher than ours, this is something of which we can be very proud.<\/p>  <p>  F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann is playing an important role in ensuring that this success translates into the development of our own indigenous sector.  I note the high level of interest in the new writing development loans earlier in the year as an indication that these productions have led to a growing level of interest.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to take this opportunity to note in particular the high level of female protagonists and producers in Irish film in recent years.  Last year, seven out of ten Irish films had a female protagonist.  This is something of which we can be proud.  The monitoring that F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann has undertaken is of great value.  However, I note that the number of female directors has stayed relatively stagnant at just over 20%.

We have huge potential as a location and as a centre of creativity and artistic endeavour, as well as all of the other skill sets that those within the film industry, and some who have been shut out of it, can contribute if allowed.  This legislation is welcome in that it helps to ensure that we can compete.  When I was first elected, the danger was that if we got rid of section 481, we would allow other countries to steal a march on us.  I do not think we have managed to get as much benefit as possible from the State's investment in the film industry.  That is what section 481 does.  It is an investment that encourages foreign and Irish companies to invest through a tax benefit.<\/p>  <p>  In an industry such as this there are always concerns, problems and issues.  I will propose an amendment on Committee Stage providing not just for a passing examination but for a full report into the terms and conditions of workers.  The most recent economic analysis of the audiovisual sector in Ireland that I have seen suggests that we are supporting the employment of nearly 17,000 people.  In all of my dealings with them, people who work at various levels of the film industry, including carpenters, security men, drivers of cars and trucks, stunt men, directors and those who polish the finished product so that we can see it, say that sometimes the calculation of the number engaged in the film industry is skewed.  Sometimes people work twice or three times in a year.  They are counted twice or three times in the accounts because they work for different companies as various films or opportunities come up.  They are recorded as working full-time.  They might work for six months for this company, three months for another then somewhere else for a further month.  There are often quite long gaps between engagements.  That is recorded as though three people were employed.  It is a concern.<\/p>  <p>  There are also huge concerns about those who are not recorded.  To this day there are many workers serving indefinite internships without pay.  There are those who are titled trainees but whose traineeships do not have end dates.  I do not know whether all of the trainees are accounted as full-time personnel in the film industry.  There is a job of work to be done in ascertaining exactly how many are working at a given time.  Then we can properly assess the value of our contribution to the film industry here and abroad.<\/p>  <p>  There are also questions about whether we are getting the full value out of our facilitation of the film industry.  Some of the criteria or application forms could be tweaked so that more foreign money might be spent on film production.  Sometimes that funding goes askew via Irish-based companies.  I am told that for a foreign film company to avail of this, it must have an Irish producer, an Irish address or whatever.<\/p><p>The cost of going through some of the Irish companies may be greater than directly employing or recruiting staff.  Those issues have been raised with me.  I have not checked the veracity of the claims but in the absence of any indication to the contrary, it is key that they be addressed.<\/p> <p> The issue of terms and conditions must be considered.  Are workers paid overtime when the filming of a shoot which is scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. and finish at 6 p.m. is extended until 10 p.m. by the director?  I have been told they are not.  If one complains, one will be blacklisted and not hired for the next set or film.  This is a small island and it is a small industry, which makes it very easy to identify malcontents.  Actors may be affected by such decisions, but those who do much of the real work - I do not suggest that acting is not real work - in terms of the heavy lifting of creating sets-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600031#GG00300","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544109000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Tut tut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600032#HH00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1544109000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>-----or having responsibility for transport or health and safety, those without whom the actors would not have a stage or location, must sometimes work long after the producer has gone to bed.<\/p>  <p>  There are many aspects to the industry.

Several issues were subsequently raised with members of the committee involved in producing its report, as well as with other Members who have a long-standing interest in the area.  Organisations involved in the film industry want changes and we need a forum in which to listen to them.  We must be able to ensure that action is taken where necessary and that legislation is in place to protect these workers, as is the case in every other industry in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill relates to the Irish Film Board, but I wish to raise an important associated issue.  As I stated, many of those involved in the film industry are temporary workers.  We should examine how the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection treats and accounts for those workers.  A difficulty arises for many such people in dealing with the Department, whether through the local social welfare inspector or the private companies which are now supposed to seek full-time work for people, when they are awaiting the next production.  There can be several months between productions.  Very few people in the film industry seamlessly transition from one production to the next.  There is downtime.  The Department should be mindful of the benefits that accrue to Ireland from the documentaries, dramas and other films that are produced here.  It should consider its treatment of those who are genuinely working in the film industry and can prove that through membership of Equity or another union representing film industry workers.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has looked at issues to do with internships and so on.  It should give detailed consideration to whether there is a proper internship structure within the film industry such that there is no abuse of workers' rights, such as charging young people who wish to be part of the film industry to be on set, and that proper rates of pay and working hours are in place.  Those in the trade understand that shoots may run over time, but workers deserve to be compensated for additional hours worked, as would be the case in any other employment.  That is of some relevance to the Bill because companies involved in some of the big shoots in this country refuse to go over budget even if that means that workers are left short.  The disregard that is sometimes shown for workers in the industry is totally wrong.<\/p>  <p>  There is no mechanism to resolve human resources grievances in the industry.  To whom does one go in such a situation?  One may go to one's union, but, as companies are set up on a film-by-film basis, the shoot may be completed and the film released by the time one's complaint is heard.  <\/p>  <p>  The promotion of the Irish film industry is of primary importance.  There has been an absolute &eacute;acht and tremendous work in terms of what Ireland has produced in recent times.  We could and should produce far more, given our history and creativity.   We can tell stories and act and sell those stories in the medium of film to the best in the world.  There should be a greater concentration on home-grown films rather than depending on big film companies to come into the country.  Not very many of them have done so.  Many people lauded the fact that Star Wars was filmed in Ireland but in reality that formed a minuscule part of the film, although it presented Ireland in a very attractive manner and was very beneficial to the tourism industry on the west coast.  The production was not wholly filmed or edited in Ireland.  It is probably true that no film is produced  in one location from start to finish.<\/p>  <p>  The recent changes in terms of locations and studios will probably attract more and bigger productions but we must also protect our investment, as well as the terms and conditions of those involved in the industry.  We must ensure that recipients of funding under section 481 do not abuse that in any way, such as by making a killing for themselves while workers are not being fully paid.  We struggle to address issues in many other aspects of our economy such as health, social welfare, housing and so on.<\/p><p>As always seems to happen, some people abuse tax reliefs for their own benefit.  The tax relief in question was set up specifically to attract companies to Ireland, enhance our home-grown industry and ensure we have first-class opportunities for all in the film industry, including those involved in making dramas and documentaries.  We have proven we are capable of matching the best in the world.  I will raise these concerns.<\/p> <p> There is a short period in which to submit amendments.  We have until 11 a.m. tomorrow to submit amendments before returning to this Bill next week.  If I have not formulated those amendments, I do not intend in any way to delay the passage of the Bill but I want to make sure it is stated that my party and I will not tolerate some of the abuses I have heard about in recent weeks, some of which I was aware of before now through friends and colleagues who work in the industry.  We have raised this matter in the House in the past.  There is an onus on the Minister not only to pass this Bill but also to act on some of the points I have raised and that other Deputies may also raise to ensure the industry will be a fair one and that we will get the best out of it in many senses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600032#HH00300","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544109600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Film, whether for cinema, television or small personal screens, is probably the most popular cultural activity, not only in Ireland but also on the planet.  In that sense, having a screen or film industry in Ireland is very important in terms of the country's capacity to respond in cultural terms to the modern world and modern life.  Almost every European country, and most other countries, seek to have a film industry.<\/p>  <p>  The context of this Bill is raising the maximum aggregate amount of investment, loans, grants or moneys provided from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.  That is broadly welcome.  What is lacking in the Department, however, is a sense of current policy other than in a very narrow commercial sense.  The Minister is in her job for quite a while now.  Has she come to any view, as Minister, as to how the industry should be developed?  We need to move on from the model that former Minister Michael D. Higgins established in the 1990s, which has been enormously successful.  We need to move on with development.  There has not been much information from the Department other than programmes that taxpayers find very difficult to understand.  The Irish Film Board went out of existence quite a long time ago.  I do not understand, therefore, why this Bill does not refer to Screen Ireland.  Screen Ireland is inclusive of the broader industry because people consume the product in a variety of ways in addition to traditional film shown in traditional cinemas.<\/p>  <p>  Let me outline what I would like to know in the first instance.  In terms of the structures of Screen Ireland, why not have a project board that addresses in a formal way the issues concerning training, because this is where it starts, and also apprenticeships, including recognised apprenticeships, in the film industry?  Has the Department any proposals on new apprenticeships so the many young people interested in working broadly in the screen, film and audiovisual areas will have an opportunity and structured way in which to seek to develop a career in the industry?  Would the Minister be prepared to implement this structure directly through this legislation or in the form of ministerial regulations?<\/p>  <p>  As we all appreciate, the difficulty with film is that it is project based.  Staff move from project to project.  Therein lies the problem, particularly for people starting off in the industry.  I refer to how they get training, education and appropriate experience in a way that is constructive for them as individuals and also constructive for the future of film in Ireland.  There should certainly be a trade union-based industry in Ireland.  If we do not have a structure, there is a risk that employees in the industry, especially in the early stages and in certain elements of the industry, will end up in very precarious employment while some of those on top will end up in very lucrative employment, most frequently self-employed people on contracts of limited duration for the length of a project.  We need to think about that and reflect it in the Bill.  The Minister needs to do so in order that those who have the objective of securing the tax reliefs and tax breaks will have a structure available to them by which they are made aware of what is necessary to proceed properly and treat people properly.<\/p>  <p>  There was a disturbing report on film on \"Prime Time\" recently.  We have all been approached by people on the production side and those working in the industry about concerns they have about terms and conditions of employment.<\/p>  <p>  An issue arises about regional supports and how the industry is placed around the country.  For instance, some supports are not necessarily available in the Cork area.  Has the Minister considered this?  Will she tell us what the problem is there?  There are other parts of the country that might like to develop a film industry but it is a bit opaque as to how they might go about doing so.  Private studios are being developed around the country.  With the State having agreed to the disposal of Ardmore, what is the Minister's view, from a policy perspective, on how the State should continue to be involved?  Is the State just the awarder of grants and tax breaks or will it have a more central role in the industry?<\/p>  <p>  In Fine Gael, there is an ethos of privatisation of everything and minimum regulation of everything.  In this case, however, we need to hear from the Minister her take on regulation and the involvement and expression of the involvement and interest of the public in this area given that the public, through the tax system, ultimately ends up being a significant contributor.<\/p><p> People have raised other issues with me.  I know the industry itself has done a lot of work on this, but what is the position regarding children on set and how are they protected when working on set?  I know that guidelines have been produced for films, but the Department, given its role, needs to be a leader in this regard.  I do not know whether the Minister has seen, been consulted on, or carried out her own consultations on the guidelines for children on set, whether they need to be encoded in a form of regulation to provide for appropriate and maximum protection for minors on sets, and how this should be approached.<\/p> <p> I wish to ask about another feature of the industry which has received a lot of attention in recent times.  I refer to the gender pay gap.  We are all aware of the fact that there has been worldwide disclosure on the gender pay gap in the film industry, including in areas such as Hollywood that we would most associate with the film industry on an international scale.  There has also been such disclosure in companies such as the BBC, which is heavily involved in film, and recent disclosures in RT&Eacute; on gender pay parity.  Does the Minister have a policy on this?  Should we have a code that is reflected either in ministerial regulation or in the Act itself?  I want to hear from the Minister what her policies are in this regard.  This all fits into the broad ambit of employment policy and the conditions and protections that exist in the industry.<\/p> <p> I am also conscious of the fact that throughout the country there are now many overall media, film, arts and culture courses that involve film as a constituent part in further education and in third level, college and university education.  The project-based nature of the industry, however, means it is very hard for people to get a start in it.  People who come from families that may already be in the industry have a head start because they know where they are going, but others can find it very difficult to get a foothold.  If we want to build up a sustainable cadre of people in Ireland who can express their creativity and their talents in the industry, it is very important there is a pathway for people to become involved in the industry in which they have spent a significant amount of time training or working for degrees, including postgraduate degrees.  Again, the same issues arise worldwide.  What is the Minister's policy on educational and training courses for the industry?  Some are private; some are public.  I hear suggestions from time to time that there may be too many courses and not enough employment available for all the people doing them.  What is the Minister's and the Department's view on this?<\/p> <p> I have raised with the Minister on many occasions the issue of Luggala, the home of the late Garech de Br&uacute;n, who did so much for culture, music, film and the arts in Ireland.  That estate, the 5,000 acres in the Wicklow Mountains, has been the scene of quite a few famous films and occasions.  I and other Deputies have asked the Minister to consider acquiring the estate on behalf of the State.  I realise and appreciate that this is almost exclusively a Fine Gael Government, that Fine Gael is averse to public ownership of additional assets and that its small number of coalition partners do not seem particularly interested in being involved in this at all.  Luggala and its surroundings are very famous in Irish film history.  Has the Minister in any way advanced her examination of the State taking Luggala, especially the land, into public ownership?  I think we are all concerned that private property signs have been erected in recent months on the approach to an area which until now people have been free to access and which, as I said, is very much associated with films and film-making in Ireland.<\/p> <p> I did not get a copy of the Minister's script.  Does she have one available to give to us?  I would like to know the details of policy as she has considered and developed it since she came into the Department.  It is important that the Minister fills us in on these details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600033#JJ00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544110200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>This is a very important debate.  I queried the description of this Bill as a technical Bill at the Business Committee, where it was originally suggested the Bill be taken all in one go, through all Stages, without pre-legislative scrutiny.  The argument put forward was that it was a technical Bill and, therefore, it was justified to short-circuit the normal legislative process.  Any short-circuiting of the legislative process, for almost any reason, must immediately raise questions, to which answers must be given.  Sometimes it is justified, and I am not casting aspersions, but we must always check these things.  A Bill that extends the loan capacity of the Irish Film Board by &euro;200 million is definitely not technical.  It is a very big decision to extend the board's loan capacity.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the annual allocation of money is decided as a budgetary matter.  We have had these discussions with many bodies we have set up, particularly in recent years, such as State agencies and so on with loan capacities.  They have been scrutinised very heavily and there has been pre-legislative scrutiny and all Stages necessary to scrutinise and amend Bills that deal with this matter.  Since its inception, the Irish Film Board has lent out &euro;298 million, I think, and, because it has reached the limit, we must now extend its loan capacity to &euro;500 million.  That is a hell of a lot of money and it requires serious debate.<\/p>  <p>  Given we are so close to the wire, I do not want to push the Irish Film Board and, consequently, the entire Irish film industry over a cliff of no funding - I doubt anyone does - which is what would happen if we stopped or delayed this Bill.  However, it should not have come to this.  This debate should have begun earlier and there should have been more serious scrutiny of the Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Government, the Business Committee, the Ceann Comhairle and so on agreed to split the debate into at least two sessions, whereby we take Second Stage today and Committee and Remaining Stages on Tuesday, but this gives only until tomorrow to table amendments.<\/p><p>That is not a whole lot of time for people who may be watching this and who are very interested in what is going on to submit amendments-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600034#KK00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544110800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The Deputy is very optimistic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600035#LL00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1544110800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>-----to this Bill.  There are many people watching this.  I can tell the Deputy that for a fact.  There is much interest in what is going on in the Irish film industry at the moment.  Let us be honest, there is also a great deal of dispute about what is going on in the film industry.  We need to resolve it because the film industry is very important.  As I said as a preamble to all of my interventions on this issue, of which there have been quite a number over the past year, I want to see the Irish film industry seriously supported by the Government.  I want to see more investment in the industry to allow us to operate even more effectively on the international stage and utilise the enormous talent existing in many areas in this country, whether it is writing, directing, producing, stagecraft, building stages, making props, lighting, wardrobe or make-up.  We have all of those skills in abundance.<\/p>  <p> The industry has produced wonderful successes and many fantastic films, actors and directors who have given a small country like ours a disproportionate impact on the global stage.  I would not want to do anything but support, promote and strengthen the State and public support for the industry.  I also want to commend the Minister, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  In response to some of the issues I raised in recent months, I was contacted by senior officials in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as officials in the Revenue Commissioners, in the Department of Finance and in the office of the Minister for Finance himself, to discuss these issues.  I welcome that there seems to be a very serious effort by a number of Departments to engage with the concerns I have and that have been raised with me to get a film industry that works for everybody and takes us to new heights of film production with all of the associated skills.  I welcome all of that.<\/p>  <p>  We do, however, have to address the issues, the disputes, the conflicts and the problems in the industry to ensure that it does achieve what it is capable of achieving.  There are problems in this regard.  To cut a long story short, what we need to do is to get to the facts of what is actually happening in the industry.  There is a problem in trying to do that.  We are not getting to the facts of what is going on in the industry.   It is slightly disappointing to me, as a great fan of the arts, to discover through various interactions in the past year that there is ruthless competition in this creative industry.  That is disappointing.  We would have hoped there would have been more harmony and co-operation.  There is, however, a hell of a lot of competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600035#LL00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1544110800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>It is a bit like politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600035#LL00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1544110800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>It is a bit like politics, indeed.  We might have hoped, though, that the arts would have been slightly different.  We need to try to address some of these problems.  The key to getting to the bottom of it is trying to find out what is going on and resolving the issues rather than what has been happening.  There has been a slagging match between different factions with accusations, counter-accusations and allegations from one sector against another<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues has evolved.  It is very important because it is the condition of section 481 tax relief.  I will read it for the Minister who has come in to replace the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, whom I hope will be back.  The condition of getting section 481 tax relief, worth &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million a year, is that it acts as an effective stimulus to film making in the State through, among other things, the provision of quality employment and training opportunities.  We should stress that in addition to that &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million from section 481, last year there were also &euro;12 million worth of loans from the Irish Film Board.  That amount varies between &euro;12 million and about &euro;15 million.  That is a great deal of money and it is conditional on producing quality employment and training.<\/p>  <p>  It is the obligation of the State, public representatives and the various Departments that oversee these funds to see if that is happening.  That is the law.  We need to find out if that is happening.  The first step in doing that is to find out how many people actually work in the industry and how many people are trainees in the industry.  I am referring to registered employees and trainees.  We do not really know that figure.  The Olsberg SPI report, for example, did help to make progress on answering how many people are involved in the industry.  At the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, and its report in January 2018, the Irish Film Board stated that there were 17,000 full-time equivalents working in the industry.  Many workers from the industry came in after, however, and stated that there were actually almost no full-time jobs in the film industry.  We therefore have a claim of 17,000 full-time equivalents on the one hand, and have workers who are experienced in the industry for many years stating there is almost no full-time employment for most grades in the film industry.<\/p>  <p>  There is a big gap between 17,000 and almost none.  What is the answer?  The Olsberg SPI report begins to move us a little bit in the direction of answering this question.  We discovered from that report that the 17,000 figure takes into account areas such as radio, video games, commercial advertising, animation, people who work in RT&Eacute; etc.  The 17,000 figure is not an accurate picture of what is going on in the Irish film industry at all.  It includes all sorts of other areas.  Now, let us get to the truth.  How many people are actually working in the film industry?  When it is broken down a little more, we are told further down in the small print of that report that there is an employment base of 6,300.  That is considerably less than 17,000.  That translates into 3,260 full-time equivalents, but full-time equivalents are not jobs.  How many people, therefore, can we estimate actually work in the film industry?  The answer is that we do not really know.  It is probably somewhere less than or close to 3,000.  Some people would put the figure at as low as 1,700 or 1,800 people.<\/p>  <p>  That is a big difference.  How many people are trainees?  Can we track them?  Do we know at what stage of their training they are at?  No, we do not, because there is no training structure.  Nobody knows when the training begins, how it is accredited, at what point a trainee is finished or at what point he or she becomes qualified in a particular grade or category of employment within the film industry.  I understand there are about 77 different grades and categories in the industry, just to make it even more complicated.  Recently, a worker from the industry informed me that there was a register of trainees a few years back.  It actually had the names of the trainees.  I suggest to the Minister that we need the names of the people who are registered trainees so that we can track who is a trainee, whether they are moving from one production to another, progressing through their training, becoming qualified and then having a career in the industry.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to know who are the experienced workers in the industry and if they are gaining quality employment.  I refer to the accusations of people being blackballed if they ask for direct PAYE employment as opposed to being categorised as contractors or subcontractors.<\/p><p>Recently, on a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; special, allegations were thrown around that particular groups of workers, represented by the Irish Film Workers Association, IFWA, and the GMB trade union, which were making demands for more direct employment in the industry were, in fact, a troublemaking faction which just wanted to control it and a bit dodgy.  I am not in a position to judge any of it.  However, insofar as I have interacted with these groups, all they have asked for are conditions with which I am familiar in the construction industry, namely, direct PAYE employment on the basis that everything else is precarious.  Rather than engage in accusation and counter accusation, the film industry and the Irish Film Board, in particular, need to be able to explain why it was not just the IFWA and the Irish Film Board which stated there was an issue of blacklisting, precarity and lack of continuity in employment.  In January in a direct response to me and Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell when asked if there was blacklisting in the industry the Equity representative said:<\/p><blockquote>One need only look at the results of the survey that Equity published at the end of 2016 regarding the issues of bullying and harassment to see that what the Deputy is referring to is true.  People are terrified of rocking the boat in any way, shape or form when they are in a precarious situation in work.  One of the questions on the survey asked whether respondents had ever experienced or observed any form of bullying or harassment.  Something in the region of 65% to 70% of people said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The next questions asked if they reported it.  Of that 70% of respondents who had said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, roughly 70% said that they did not report it for fear of not getting the next job.<\/blockquote><p>That is from the actors.  By the way, the Minister and I have been invited to a meeting next week in Stoneybatter of the theatre actors who are complaining about the same precarity and lack of security.  Even those who are called the creatives in the industry are saying there is a serious problem, as well as transport workers, stage crew and so on.  Whatever accusations can be made against them, they all have been working in the industry for decades.  They can show the productions on which they have worked but say they are facing blacklisting.  They go further in stating a relatively small group of companies receive the bulk of Irish Film Board grants and loans, as well as section 481 tax relief, but take no responsibility for their employees.  Although some may have received between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million in recent years in various forms of public support which I am glad they have received, they have virtually no employees.  They take no responsibility for the people who work for them because of the special purpose vehicle, SPV, structure, which means that their official employer is a company which appears and disappears like a mushroom.  Everybody knows that behind the SPV, the disappearing company is actually a parent company which is the one which applies for and receives section 481 tax relief.  Who are the employers?  One cannot have quality employment if one does not even know who the employers are.  In fact, there are no employers because of the SPV structure, but that needs to be established.  Following on from it, in order to resolve some of the issues, one needs to have a more representative Irish Film Board.  It should involve producers, directors and actors, but it should also involve PAYE workers and those in non-management grades, including those in areas such as transport, stage crew and so on to ensure a broad diversity of management and non-management grades that actually have an input.<br\/><br\/>As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, there is a serious question as to whether we need to open up section 481 tax relief to foreign producers.  Is this an issue that is hampering internal investment?  There is evidence that some of the big productions that could have come here did not come because of the particular way the industry is set up.  There is also evidence that the structures are different in other countries.  Why was &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; filmed in the North rather than here?  If we are putting &euro;300 million through the Irish Film Board and providing up to &euro;1 billion in section 481 tax relief, is there something a bit odd that the State does not have any film assets of its own?  It does not own any machinery and has just sold off the last bit of the national studios at Ardmore to a private company.  Imagine if we had no Abbey Theatre or municipal theatres and it was a completely free floating industry.  Imagine if the national theatre became a place which only appeared to put on a play and then disappeared with nobody having jobs.  We would find that a bit odd.  However, we are told by certain sectors of the film industry that this is the only way one can structure it.  I do not accept that for one minute.  We had Ardmore Studios which made a big impact on Irish cinema.<br\/><br\/>These matters need to be examined.  I am glad that we are having this important debate.  I know that the Minister and the Minister of Finance are genuinely engaging.  However, I will be submitting amendments to have a review clause inserted into the Bill to examine issues such as employment numbers, quality employment, and better and broader representation on the Irish Film Board.  As a condition in passing the legislation, we need the Government to commit to dealing with these issues within a set timeframe to address the concerns raised and overcome some of the conflicts and give the film industry the boost and support it needs to thrive in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600035#LL00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544111400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>The Minister has stated this is a straightforward technical Bill which will have no impact on the Exchequer.  That is because the funding to meet the extra loan capacity of &euro;200 million will not come directly from the Exchequer.  While I was not as involved as Deputy Boyd Barrett in the discussion in the past year about working conditions in the film industry, I have met workers in it to discuss the issue.  The mind boggles when one hears a figure of 17,000 fill-time equivalents.  However, from talking to workers on the ground, the actual experience totally contradicts that number.  When I met several film industry workers, they pointed out that the Irish film and television industry was heavily funded by the taxpayer.  The money is distributed to companies in the form of tax relief and by the Irish Film Board which gives and lends money to Irish production companies which never seems to be returned.  They also informed me that money was given for feasibility studies for productions which might never take off.  Who is accountable for the expenditure of all of this money?<\/p>  <p>  Section 481 was included to create equality and fair employment in the film industry.  Hoever, there seems to be little of it.  Contractors have been brought in to undermine the terms and conditions of workers.  Many of the contractors have been operating illegally for several years.  Some of them facilitate the shadow economy and have gained a favoured position with production companies as they have done work at a cheaper rate.  However, no checks have been carried out by the production companies to ascertain where taxpayers&rsquo; money has gone.

They have worked in the industry for more than 20 years and know that there is trouble in every department, from costuming and cameras to props, art, locations, hair and makeup, construction, driving and so on.  They claim that the industry needs to change.  Production companies seem to believe that they do not have to give workers any right or follow any requirement by law, the law being the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The companies give rights and follow the requirements on paper when they apply for grants, but not on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  The people whom Deputy Broughan and I spoke to told us that they had worked in the industry for a long time and had seen bullying, blackballing and the consistent concern of crew members that they would not be on the next job if they asked for their basic rights and entitlements under the law.  These people, who have families, children, mortgages and bills, are fighting for their livelihoods in this industry, which can well afford to pay workers a decent amount and offer them decent, quality and long-term job security.<\/p>  <p>  It is a scandal that taxpayers' money could be used by an industry that perpetuates bogus self-employment.  It is not acceptable.  It is not for the Opposition to determine how to resolve this issue.  We will assist, but it must be done by the workers, employers and Government in accordance with industrial laws.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection has launched an investigation into bogus self-employment.  I have requested that the workers affected in the film industry be invited to the committee.  I do not know how our investigation would support the Minister's interest in this situation, as we would be inviting people from a number of industries, including English language teachers, in which respect there has been a catastrophe in recent days.  It is important that we invite workers from the film industry who have been impacted by this situation.  The committee will investigate whether there is rampant bogus self-employment in the industry and how that might impact on workers, and determine how to feed its examination into the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's investigation into such jobs.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know whether I can support the Bill.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned, it is a proud industry because people can watch a big movie and say that it came from Ireland.  The many people involved in the industry would make one proud.  However, we cannot continue to facilitate an industry over which there are serious question marks.  This issue does not just arise in the film industry, but right across the board.  As the Parliament, we have a responsibility to tackle it.<\/p>  <p>  There should be a register of employees, trainees and apprenticeships in the film industry.  There used to be registers previously, so having them back would assist in protecting workers.  The Irish Film Board is composed of producers, directors and actors, but not workers.  I was about to say \"directly employed workers\", but they are not even directly employed in the film industry.  They are in bogus self-employment.<\/p>  <p>  The joint committee will play a role in the Department's investigation by investigating the allegations that have been made to the scope section of the Department and appealed to its appeals office by employers.  I would have to think long and hard about this Bill and would support any amendment that strengthened workers' rights in the industry.  If we are to give more leeway and opportunities to producers to make more money, that money must go into workers' pockets in the form of proper pay and job security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600037#NN00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1544112000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>There have been many contributions.  I thank the D&aacute;il and acknowledge Members' interest and support on Second Stage.  I have taken note of the various views expressed and will try to answer some as best I can.  It was heartening to witness the engagement on and interest in some of the issues that were raised.  It showed the Deputies' collective interest in the audiovisual sector.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Smyth is not present, but she indicated her support for the Bill.  I noted her positive contribution regarding the industry in general.  She wants to see gender parity in the industry, which we will address by 2020 through many various measures.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh broadly welcomed the Bill.  I acknowledge his points about section 481.  The Minister for Finance has extended that relief to 2024.  The Deputy also discussed terms and conditions and queried the statistics on the numbers employed.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the training regime, Screen Skills Ireland has responsibility for skills as the national skills development agency.  Recommendations were made.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned the joint Oireachtas committee report.  Screen Ireland has put in place a sub-committee of its board to cover training and skills and to act on the recommendations listed in both reports.  Through this training advisory sub-committee, Screen Ireland has commenced work on some of the recommendations, including business skills development, matching of skills with production growth and greater alignment with third level sector and network training.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's comments on employment in general, my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, is introducing legislation that will improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts, which is an issue that Deputy Boyd Barrett also raised.  The joint Oireachtas committee made a number of recommendations and Screen Ireland is considering them.  Both Deputies mentioned an industry forum.  As they know, it is being worked on.  We are trying to see how matters can progress in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding section 481, officials from my Department are engaging with the Revenue Commissioners on the new arrangements concerning training issues.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton raised a number of queries.  We are putting a significant amount of money - &euro;1.5 billion - into the audiovisual sector, as well as &euro;200 million into the audiovisual action plan, over the next ten years.  Screen Ireland has 140 projects for distribution and 700 for development.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies raised the issue of employment.  In particular, Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about how many people were employed or not employed.  From our information, there are 16,930 people working full time in the industry.  Since last year, there has been an increase in this budget of &euro;2 million to &euro;20.4 million.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton referenced the gender pay gap.  We are considering a gender pay gap information Bill.  She also mentioned Cork, but I will have to look into that matter to see what support she meant.  There is a great deal of regional support in Limerick where Troy Studios is located.  The Deputy acknowledged the importance of the Irish film industry, which I echo.  She supports creativity and innovation, which is fine.<\/p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned it mainly with regard to Screen Ireland and the training regime.  About 60 courses in 2017 were run by Screen Skills Ireland.  It provided training for about 1,558 individuals in 2017.  More than 25 industry professionals availed of the bursary scheme and trained overseas.  There was targeted and strategic training for the animation sector, which is growing at an exponential rate.  Work-based learning initiatives are being implemented.<\/p> <p> Disputes and conflicts were looked at by the Oireachtas committee.  It proposed a forum.  Some of my officials met Deputy Boyd Barrett last week regarding this Bill.  There is urgency with regard to increasing the statutory limit so, from that perspective, it is a technical Bill.  I agree with the Deputy that it probably should have been done before this, but it was not, so it must be done.  Otherwise, we will not be in a position to do anything.  There is time to bring forward amendments.  If the Deputy wants to do so, that is at his discretion.  The Deputy will know that my Department and Screen Ireland are examining the options, but there are challenges relating to all of these matters.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for raising the issues.  Screen Ireland has a dual mandate to develop Irish film-making and audiovisual production talent that can engage audiences at home and abroad while maintaining and building the resources, craft and skills of the Irish industry by attracting international productions to Ireland.  I think most of the Deputies would accept that we want to ensure that Ireland remains attractive to the film industry.  An unprecedented amount of money will go into this area over the next few years.  There is general goodwill in respect of this area in Ireland.  In my opening remarks, I mentioned some Academy awards and Golden Globe awards we have won across the spectrum, including animation, which is a new and growing sector.  Evidence of the necessity for legislation is borne out by Screen Ireland's activity in recent years.  I outlined that earlier.  The film and television industries are very labour-intensive and, by its very nature, any investment in production creates employment.  Every euro invested by Screen Ireland in production produces a multiple return on that investment.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I hope this Bill will enable us to copper-fasten Ireland's reputation as a centre of excellence in all matters audiovisual over the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600037#NN00300","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544112600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544112600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 11 December 2018.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Investment Fund Agreement Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Second Stage","time":1544112600,"counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600038#OO00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1544112600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this opportunity to present the European Investment Fund Agreement Bill 2018 to the House.  This short technical Bill will enable the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into agreements with the European Investment Fund, known as the EIF, to facilitate access to finance for qualifying enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  The new future growth loan scheme was announced in the budget as part of the Government's response to Brexit, and enactment of this Bill will allow us to launch the scheme in early 2019.  The future growth loan scheme will be an important support for Irish businesses throughout the country that are facing challenges arising from Brexit.  It will be available to SMEs, including those in the primary agriculture and the seafood sector.<\/p>  <p>  To bring this loan scheme to the Irish market in early 2019, it is imperative that we as Ministers are granted the necessary powers to enter into the agreement with the EIF this year, which includes providing the necessary Exchequer funding.  This scheme is an important component of the Government's Brexit mitigation measures for businesses as it will provide businesses with the opportunity to borrow for periods between eight to ten years to support long-term capital investment.  The tenure of borrowing currently available on the market for SMEs is typically anywhere from three to seven years.  The future growth loan scheme has been developed to address a gap in the market for longer-term loans up to ten years.  It will support those enterprises that wish to invest and diversify their business by ensuring they have appropriate and affordable financing available to them.  This in turn will fuel future economic growth in our important indigenous sectors by helping them to remain competitive.  Given the particular exposure of the food sector to Brexit, the scheme, which will be 40% funded by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will also be available to primary producers.<\/p>  <p>  To unlock the EIF counter-guarantee, which will be used to leverage funding of up to &euro;300 million for the future growth loan scheme, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will collectively contribute &euro;62 million in Exchequer funding over a five-year period.  This counter-guarantee with the EIF is a bespoke agreement, which is wider in scope than those available through the European Commission and offers 64% risk cover rather than the standard 40%.  It represents the first time that the Ministers have entered into such an agreement, although there is the potential for further such agreements in the future if needed.  The Attorney General has advised that primary legislation is needed to provide the necessary powers to both Ministers to enter into such an agreement.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will contribute 40% of the loan fund on the basis that it is anticipated that at least 40% of the scheme will be used by food businesses and primary producers.  The remaining 60% will be channelled through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation's Vote in 2018 and subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  I will now go through the heads of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the relevant Minister as the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine as they are the Ministers entering into the agreement with the EIF for the future growth loan scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 provides the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine with the power to enter into agreements with the EIF with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This includes providing the necessary financial contribution from the Irish Exchequer and limiting this to an aggregate total of &euro;75 million should the Ministers wish to implement additional schemes concurrently.  It also includes the discharge of any additional fees and expenses.  Definitions of qualifying enterprise, SME and small mid-cap are also referenced here.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 provides for a review of the operation of the Act four years after its passage.  Section 4 provides that expenses incurred in the administration of the Act be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 5 provides for the Short Title and the commencement provision.<\/p>  <p>  This short Bill is important as it will allow the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into an agreement with the EIF to implement the future growth loan scheme, which is a critical component of the Government's response to Brexit.  Essentially, the future growth loan scheme is a longer-term Brexit loan scheme.  If we want to ensure our businesses throughout the country succeed and prosper in the face of fundamental challenges like Brexit, it is essential that we take the necessary steps to ensure appropriate financial supports such as this scheme are in place for businesses.  I look forward to hearing Deputies' contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600038#OO00500","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1544112600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>We will be supporting the Bill and will do everything to ensure it passes smoothly through the parliamentary process.  We welcome the fact that we are putting in place funds for small and medium-sized businesses in both the business and agriculture sectors to allow them to access loans to fund working capital projects.<\/p><p>We all know that there is grave uncertainty, primarily as a result of Brexit, the America First policy, tariffs and potential trade wars and all that flows from them.  Uncertainty is the barrier to investment.  It diminishes people's business confidence and very quickly access to credit dries up.  People cannot invest and there are difficulties in maintaining growth in individual companies and the broader economy.  This fund, therefore, is very welcome.<\/p> <p> In the coming months we will be trying to ensure we are as Brexit-proofed as possible.  There are uncertainties beyond our control.  We are waiting for Westminster to decide on the Prime Minister, Mrs. May's proposals.  We do not know if they will be successful in the short or medium term, but what we do know is that there will not be many upsides to Brexit for Ireland.  We can start planning and ensuring support for small and medium-sized businesses that are dependent on the export market, primarily to the United Kingdom but also farther afield.<\/p> <p> Diversification is critically important.  Companies need to be weaned off their dependence on the UK market because of proximity and language; they need to look farther afield into the eurozone and beyond.  All of these things will take time, planning and effort.  I know that Enterprise Ireland and others are continually supporting that process.  Credit is a critically important component for any organisation that is trying to expand and open up new markets for its products.  That is something about which I would be concerned.  It seems that we have not been able to encourage enough companies to look beyond immediate markets and diversify, as is the policy.  Providing supports for companies, through Enterprise Ireland and others, will be a necessary component in ensuring that process continues.<\/p> <p> The European Investment Fund was established because of the credit crisis and the fact that small and medium sized businesses were unable to access credit in the traditional forms through banks.  I am concerned that the risk has shifted from the pillar banks back to the use of these funds again.  It should be additional funding, not replace what the pillar banks should be funding.  We must be able to monitor what is happening in the short and medium term.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation will have statutory powers to enter into agreements to draw down loans.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland will assess individual applicants to see whether they are suitable and I assume they will then make an application through the pillar banks or the financial institutions participating in the scheme.  That is the issue about which I have concerns.  The participating lending institutions to which applicants will go are the same ones with which they would be doing business in the traditional manner.  I do not want to see a situation where banks will start to lend money through this scheme but squeeze the credit they should be lending to their clients.  It must be additional funding; it cannot be replacement funding.  <\/p> <p> We are subservient to the lending institutions and I am consistently critical of the pillar banks.  They are simply not engaging meaningfully to try to address the credit challenges for small and medium-sized businesses and in the broader economy.  I have continually referenced the fact that interest rates in Ireland are completely out of kilter with those charged across the eurozone.  Interest rates are 5% and 6% to fund a small or medium-sized business in Ireland.  Businesses in the eurozone can access loans for much less.  The pillar banks are consistently gouging the economy, day in and day out, and we have done nothing about it.  They will continue to gouge and profiteer on the backs of small and medium-sized businesses.  They are also doing it in the mortgage market and we are subservient to them.  We accept it, nod and gracefully allow them to continue.  We then go to the established European Investment Fund to borrow from it and allow the pillar banks to disperse the funding, unless I am misreading the Bill.  We must insist, through whatever mechanism is required, on this being additional funding.  In other words, it is to fund the higher risk elements and the pillar banks should fund the lower risk elements, but I can guarantee that they will fund their clients through this fund.  They will replace the funding, which is not good enough.<\/p> <p> The Minister only needs to look at previous funds that were made available through the pillar banks to small and medium-sized businesses and the agriculture sector.  That is what they did.  They lent to people who were very low risk, their immediate clients and had a good client base.  People who actually needed working capital and those with cashflow difficulties who needed short-term loans could not access funds.  There has to be some independent assessment of a refusal.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland states whether a client is suitable.  The client then makes an application to the relevant financial institution, but if the client already has an application for funding through the pillar bank, I would be very disappointed if that funding was replaced.  I hope the Minister will bring clarity to the matter and insist on it not being replacement funding.<\/p> <p> How Brexit ready are we?  In looking at the applications under the various schemes available we have to acknowledge that businesses have been slow enough in taking up some of them.  For example, there were 307 applications received under the Brexit loan scheme, of which 270 were approved by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, while 54 progressed to sanction at bank level, to a value of &euro;12.5 million.  To say the very least, that is a fairly high refusal rate.  Enterprise Ireland has an online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their level of exposure to Brexit - the Brexit scorecard.  A total of 3,332 Brexit scorecards have been completed, including by 502 local enterprise office clients.  That is a reasonable effort, but, when looked at in the overall context of the number of Enterprise Ireland clients, it could be a lot better.<\/p> <p> The Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund, a support for Enterprise Ireland clients to research new markets, has seen 166 projects approved.  The fund was launched in 2018 and the level of expenditure to date is about &euro;165,000.  Again, in the overall context, 166 projects is a small number.  We must acknowledge that we are an exporting nation.  As we trade in open markets, we have to be lean, agile and responsive to market demands.  With Brexit as the backdrop, we must be able to respond.  Some of the application processes for the various schemes which are all good discourage people.  The most feared words in the English language are: \"I am from the Government and I am here to help.\"  To a certain extent, it is a bit like that.  The application forms discourage small and medium-sized businesses from applying.  We should look to simplify them as much as possible, while ensuring the taxpayer is protected at all times.  We need to ensure applicants are not discouraged by an avalanche of form-filling and administrative burdens.<\/p><p>When Brexit is finally decided over the coming months, regardless of whether the withdrawal agreement is accepted, we will have to contend with another major step when we enter into the next phase of our trading relationship with the UK and the EU.  One thing we know for certain among the grave uncertainty of Brexit itself is that if the UK does not decide to retreat from its present pathway by staying within the EU, there will be a different trading arrangement between the UK and the EU and therefore between the UK and Ireland.  We need to be conscious of that as well.<br\/><br\/>This issue might be slightly outside the scope of the Bill, but it needs to be considered anyway.  I have been trying to explain it.  Maybe I am not explaining it in a way that people can comprehend or understand.  Our common travel area with the UK precedes our membership of the EU.  It is part and parcel of the political, cultural and social set-up between the Republic of Ireland and the UK for many historical and political reasons.  Many of these arrangements are <i>ad hoc<\/i>in the sense that they do not have any statutory underpinning.  If and when the UK withdraws from the EU, free movement of people will become an issue for the UK and the EU.  Our common travel area with the UK will remain.  This means, in effect, that we will be in the same labour market as two entities.  We will be in the same labour market as the EU by virtue of our membership of the Union.  We will be in the same labour market as the UK by dint of having a common travel with the UK.<br\/><br\/>One of the areas in which this will be a matter of concern is the health system.  Both Ireland and the UK have major shortages of skilled labour in their health services.  When the UK withdraws from the EU, it will not have access to the EU labour market pool, but it will continue to have access to the Irish labour market pool.  There needs to be a critique and an analysis of this issue over the next short period.  We already have massive labour shortages across whole swathes of the economy in various sectors, including agriculture and high-end finance.  Many parts of our public service are under pressure because we are unable to recruit consultants, doctors, psychologists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, etc.  The labour market in the UK is facing the same challenges.  Until recently, the UK was able to fill vacancies because it was part of the EU labour market.  As that changes, the UK could very well look at the labour pool in the Republic of Ireland.  We could be in direct competition with the UK as we try to retain workers in our economy.  We are already under pressure.  I would like the Government to look at that.<br\/><br\/>The changes I have mentioned could have a profound impact on SMEs.  If we start to haemorrhage labour, the shortage of labour will undermine our competitiveness.  In such circumstances, difficulties associated with the cost of exporting into a weaker sterling zone will arise immediately.  All of these issues have the potential to have knock-on effects on the competitiveness of SMEs.  While the loan scheme for working capital that is being proposed is welcome, we need to be able to assess the various potential risks that Brexit poses for the Irish economy, including the risks for the export market and internal risks like the impact on this country's labour market.  For all of these reasons, I emphasise that everything we do should be done with potential risks very much to the fore of our minds.<br\/><br\/>I do not need to go through the technicalities of the Bill that have been outlined by the Minister of State.  The Irish pillar banks were saved by acts of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann like the bank guarantee and the legislation that was passed here to underpin it.  We threw them a lifeline.  We saved AIB and we shored up Bank of Ireland at great cost to the taxpayers and people of the State.  They are not repaying us in the way they conduct their daily affairs in almost every branch they occupy throughout the State.  The variable mortgage rate is twice the European average.  The interest rates available to SMEs are twice the European average, if not more.  Even though we are in a common currency zone under the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, our banks are consistently pillaging us.  The most amazing aspect of this is that the banks regularly announce to great fanfare that their profits have increased.  It is easy for them to increase their profits when their customers are slaving away in the workplace morning, noon and night to pay for overpriced mortgages and business loans.  If nothing else is done, this issue should be addressed, at least.<br\/><br\/>The ideal scenario, regardless of the arrangements that are put in place under the European Investment Fund, is for our banks to step up to the plate and be competitive.  They need to be able to assess loans, make lending provisions and charge reasonable interest rates, rather than the extortionate rates they currently charge.  I know that after I have spoken, I will get phone calls from representatives of the various banking organisations to tell me that I am wrong.  Unfortunately, I am not wrong.  That has been accepted by Mr. Draghi, who said when he attended an Oireachtas committee meeting some time ago that these organisations are operating a monopoly.  Monopolies are, at the very least, very damaging to economies.  Mr. Draghi said that a monopoly is being operated in this sector in this State.  I remind the Minister of State that monopolies in many parts of the economy are illegal.  We have a monopoly in this country's financial services sector.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the European Investment Fund Agreement Bill 2018 and hope it has the desired impact.  SMEs need support.  If the Government does nothing else, it should ensure our pillar banks are brought to heel and brought to book.  They need to play their role in ensuring SMEs, family homes and the broader economy are funded through reasonable interest rates, rather than the extortionate rates that are being charged by most of our pillar banks at present.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600038#OO00600","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544113800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in will support this important Bill.  It is important for us to do whatever we can to help SMEs to access credit.  Many of those involved with such enterprises have told us that they are unable to access credit at the moment.  They are getting the run-around from the banks.  I agree with Deputy Kelleher that the funds which are approved and made available have to be additional funds.  There is no point messing around with funds that are supposedly available already, but which SMEs cannot actually access.  Representatives of SMEs have made this point to us in one-to-one meetings and when they have come before committees.  As the Minister of State is probably aware, the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been preparing a report on the cost of doing business in Ireland.  The inability of SMEs to access credit and the cost of insurance are the key issues that are arising during our deliberations.  Maybe we should look at different banking systems and not just at the pillar banks we have here.  Something like the German Sparkassen banking model should be of interest to us as a way of making loans and finance available to SMEs more quickly.<\/p>  <p>  The main aim of this very short Bill is to give the Ministers for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine the power to enter into certain agreements with the European Investment Fund.  This power will allow the Ministers to set up a future loan growth scheme with the aim of providing financial support to Irish business in the run-up to and aftermath of Brexit.  The role of the European Investment Fund, which was established in 1994 as a subsidiary of the European Investment Bank, is to support SMEs and help them to access finance.  Access to credit, which is a massive issue, was raised by businesses and their representative bodies during the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation's hearings on the cost of doing business in Ireland.  Small businesses are the engine of the economy.  They exist in every local community.  The 245,000 small firms in this country account for 98% of all businesses across the State.  They employ 927,759 people and contribute &euro;66.1 billion to the economy each year.<\/p><p>Therefore, the sector deserves the required attention from Government and we are very happy to see a new investment avenue opened up by the Bill.  I hope the loan scheme is more successful than the previously announced &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme.  Unfortunately, the previous scheme was not a success.  The latest figures we received show just 38 loans to the value of &euro;8.5 million had been sanctioned out of a pot of &euro;300 million.  The scheme simply has not worked.  I hope this one will be much better.<\/p> <p> I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  Has a review of the previous Brexit loan scheme been carried out to identify whether red tape, interest rates or strict criteria contributed to the poorer than expected uptake?  It is important to ensure lessons are learned and that we move on from them.  Is the amount of taxpayer money being leveraged similar to the amount that was leveraged for the Brexit loan scheme?  Does the Government intend to establish any other schemes in addition to the future growth loan scheme that would be backed by the European Investment Fund in future?<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the importance of supporting indigenous businesses across Ireland, especially given the significant challenge of Brexit and other outside external factors which may be thrown up for the country.  We are very happy to support the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600040#QQ00200","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544114400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to speak in support of the European Investment Fund Agreement Bill 2018.

Initially I wondered why it was necessary.  Why did the Attorney General state the Government could not establish the fund?  When Mr. Andrew McDowell appeared before one of the finance committees - it may have been the Committee on Budgetary Oversight - he urged us to try to draw down more money from the European Investment Bank, of which he is our director, for infrastructural projects, small businesses and all types of business.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?<\/p>  <p>  A particularly important element of the Bill is that it will make longer term loans available to SMEs, in particular those in the seafood and primary agriculture sectors.  As a large proportion of the agriculture sector is expected to avail of the loans, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will front 40% of the fund and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation will resource the remaining 60%.  Both Departments will contribute &euro;62 million over five years.  I welcome the Minister of State's assertion that the counter-guarantee with the European Investment Fund offers 64% of the risk cover, which is an improvement on the usual 40%.  I mentioned Mr. McDowell and what he is doing on the European Investment Bank.  The Bill fits in with the wider Juncker plan from 2015 whereby &euro;315 billion was to be raised for investment in Europe by the end of this year.  How is that plan progressing?  The European Investment Fund previously committed &euro;20 million of venture capital to Ireland alone.  <\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputies Kelleher and Quinlivan.  The banking sector has not been performed well enough in supporting households or small businesses.  One has to wonder, even while the Minister of State is putting his best foot forward with the &euro;12 million per annum and the possible leveraging of &euro;300 million, whether it will be enough.  <\/p>  <p>  Major concern was expressed yesterday by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, when Mr. Seamus Coffey and his team made a presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight regarding the serious risks from Brexit, which seem to be increasing daily.  IFAC&rsquo;s fiscal assessment report on budget 2019 stated there was a reasonable probability that the transition agreement and final relationship assumed will not materialise.  IFAC referred to critical estimates of the medium-term impacts on Irish output from Brexit - we are talking about small SMEs that are exporting - at levels of 1.1% to 2.8% for a soft Brexit and 3.1% to 7% for a hard Brexit.  IFAC cautioned the figures may be an underestimate due to the intense economic connections between Britain and Ireland.  An example cited by Mr. Coffey and his colleagues is the labour intensity of Irish exports to the UK.  Our exports to Britain look smaller in monetary terms when people are making comparisons with our other export markets but they tend to have a higher number of workers' hours involved.  This is particularly true of agriculture and the food sector.  Brexit still has the potential to administer a very severe shock to the Irish economy, which may last for up to a decade.  Hence the importance and urgency of the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  Recently, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Mark Carney, delivered possible statistics arising from a cliff-edge Brexit, which would be pretty terrifying for our country.  It would seriously damage our exports as a result of the changes to the value of sterling and so on.  People have said Mr. Carney has been wrong in the past.  We have to hope our fellow parliamentarians in Westminster will somehow turn the bus away from the cliff it is heading for and not bring us with them.  <\/p>  <p>  Other Deputies have queried why there has been such poor drawdown so far from the Brexit loan scheme.  Is awareness of the availability of loans lacking or is the application process too onerous for busy SMEs trying to get through day after day?  In previous speeches, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, spoke of the responsibility of businesses to know about what loans and finance schemes are available to them.  As Deputies, our experience with community bodies and small SMEs is they do not have the resources to spend time researching Brexit loan packages.  The Be Prepared Enterprise Ireland scheme, which provides a &euro;5,000 grant, has a very low take-up, at just around six per month.  InterTradeIreland is also offering a Start to Plan voucher which is also apparently being taken up at a rate of about six per month.  These are disappointing returns, which suggest the Minister of State and his senior Minister need to get the roadshow going and get out there and try to convince people to come forward and look for supports.  <\/p>  <p>  The Brexit loan scheme of &euro;300 million, which opened in March, has only had 3% sanctioning, with a value of around &euro;8.5 million for 38 loans.  These are disappointing statistics.  I particularly welcome that the loans will be provided over the long term, for seven, eight or even ten years.  That is a major step forward, one which is badly needed in this era of increasingly sustained unpredictability.  Typically, SMEs can access borrowing for periods of between three and seven years so a term of ten years is welcome.  <\/p>  <p>  Are we remotely Brexit ready or just hoping for the best?  Are we hoping it will turn out okay on the night?  Are we doing enough?  While this is another step forward, are there other areas in which we could improve?  The British Government is in absolute turmoil.  There have been a number of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready seminars which around 4,000 participants are reported to have attended.  Enterprise Ireland is running Brexit advisory clinics.  They are all very welcome but perhaps we need to do more.  How accurate and reliable is the information given out at these clinics when we are not sure what we are heading into?  I hope the position will change because the level of unpredictability is very bad for small business. <\/p>  <p>  I have always been a strong supporter of small Irish businesses.  Throughout my career, I have always supported startups in particular to encourage dynamic people to leave unemployment.  In areas of the city with very high unemployment it has been very important to be able to set up small business centres to encourage people with innovative ideas and entrepreneurial skills to get out there and start on the road to market their skills and eventually employ other people.  <\/p>  <p>  As my colleague stated, we cannot underestimate the importance of SMEs and indigenous companies.  There are almost 250,000 small businesses in the State, comprising 98% of all businesses and contributing more than &euro;66 billion to the economy.  They cover the whole budgetary expenditure of our country.  Eligible business for this scheme include micro, small or medium-sized enterprises which employ 250 persons or fewer with a maximum annual turnover of &euro;50 million or an annual balance sheet not exceeding &euro;43 million.  Small mid-cap businesses that employ 500 persons or fewer are also eligible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120600041#RR00200","speaker":"1361"}]
