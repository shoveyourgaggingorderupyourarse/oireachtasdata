The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.<\/p><p>  The programme is operated through the Urban School Meals Scheme and the School Meals Local Projects Scheme.  The Urban School Meals Scheme is a statutory scheme that is operated in conjunction with Local Authorities and is available to primary school children.  My department jointly funds the food costs on 50\/50 basis with the Local Authorities who are responsible for the administration and operation of the scheme.  <\/p><p>  The School Meals Local Projects Scheme is an administrative scheme which is operated directly by my department and provides funding to primary and secondary schools, local groups, voluntary organisations and community-based not-for-profit preschools which operate their own school meals projects.  <\/p><p>  In recent years entry to the school meals programme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified by Department of Education and Skills as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the programme.  Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the programme. <\/p><p>  Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary with the onus being on the individual eligible schools to make an application.  Schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of the school year.  Funding is based on a rate of payment per meal, per child, per day.  The maximum rates of payment are:<\/p><p>- Breakfast\/snack club &euro;0.60;<\/p><p>- Cold Lunch &euro;1.40;<\/p><p>- Dinner &euro;1.90; and<\/p><p>- Hot School Meal &euro;2.90.<\/p><p>Applications are currently being accepted from schools for the 2020\/2021 academic year.  To date 1,303 applications have been received, of which 1,133 are awarded, 53 are pending and 117 are awaiting further information from schools in order to finalise the application.  Generally, the school meals programme does not provide funding to cover school holidays or for days when the school is closed.  However, when schools closed in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic following consultation with the Department of Education and Skills, and with the support of education management bodies, it was agreed that funding under the school meals programme could be used to support participating schools that identify pupils who are unlikely to receive nutritious food when schools were closed.  Funding was also extended to cover the summer period to ensure these children would continue to be provided with food.  Schools were not permitted to use vouchers and the majority of schools opted to provide a weekly or fortnightly food parcel.  The schools could supply food parcels to the value of the funding already allocated per child to the school.  For example, a child receiving the breakfast at 60c per day and the cold lunch at &euro;1.40 per day provided the school funding of &euro;10 per week for a food parcel.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019\/2020 academic year.  Hot meals are paid at the rate of &euro;2.90 per child per day.<\/p><p>  Budget 2020 provided an additional &euro;4 million in funding to extend the hot meals for children currently receiving the cold lunch option, which would allow my department to extend the hot meals to an additional 35,000 children.  A decision was made to delay the extension of the hot meals to January 2021 because of the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 Pandemic from 13 March 2020.  In budget 2021, I have provided an additional &euro;5.5m for this extension from January 2021 to 35,000 primary school children currently receiving the cold lunch option.

While this is ambitious, my Department and the Government are committed to its achievement over the lifetime of this strategy and this is reflected in the Programme for Government, which commits to its rigorous implementation.<\/p><p>  The most recent poverty data from the 2019 Survey on Income and Living Conditions in Ireland, published by the CSO recently, showed a national consistent poverty rate of 5.5%.  The data also showed that incomes in 2019 had increased overall and as a result the percentage of people at risk of poverty (with an income below 60% of the median) had decreased to 12.8% (from 14% in 2018), reflecting the more optimistic economic environment of only a year ago.  <\/p><p>  Social transfers continue to have a significant impact on income poverty in Ireland, with a poverty reduction effect of 58% in 2019.  However the data showed an increase in the deprivation rate to 17.8%, from 15.1% in 2018, which is a concern.<\/p><p>  The Roadmap recognises that achieving the poverty targets requires a combination of approaches including the provision of income supports, employment supports (including access to employment, education and training opportunities) and access to services (such as healthcare, childcare etc).  It also requires a collaborative approach and engagement across government.  In practical terms there are 66 unique commitments across 13 Government Departments that must be implemented in a collaborative manner if we are to make progress towards achieving this ambitious objective.<\/p><p>  Progress on the implementation of the Roadmap commitments will be monitored by the Social Inclusion Roadmap Steering Group, of which I am the Chair.  The Group is comprised of senior representatives of responsible departments at Assistant Secretary and Principal Officer Level to ensure that implementation of the Roadmap remains a priority for each department.

In particular, the Wage Subsidy Scheme is a support to employers while Partial Capacity Benefit is a support provided to individuals on Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension to assist them in returning to work.  <\/p><p>  For a private sector employer to qualify for a WSS subsidy for an employment position, the employee must not be in receipt of Illness Benefit, Invalidity Pension or Partial Capacity Benefit.  This is to avoid a situation whereby a dual subsidy being paid in respect of a single employment position.  Allowing the direction of two support payments to a single employment position would have significant cost benefit implications. <\/p><p>  The WSS is an incentive to encourage private sector employers to offer substantial and sustainable employment to people with disabilities by providing financial incentives to employers who offer employment of at least 21 and up to 39 subsidised hours per week.  It is not designed as a subsidy for part-time work of less than 21 hours.  The Department offers alternative supports to people with disabilities who may not be in a position to, or may not wish to, work full-time. <\/p><p>  The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme is available for people who have an underlying entitlement to, and have been in receipt of, Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit for at least six months.  To provide clarity to the existing practice, the WSS guidelines were amended in April 2019 to explicitly state that Partial Capacity Benefit, together with Illness Benefit and Invalidity Pension, is included on the list of schemes which an employee must not be in receipt of if the employer is to receive a WSS subsidy.  The position regarding both WSS and PCB payments not being made in respect of the same employment has not changed. <\/p><p>  There is no restriction on earnings or the number of hours a person can work on Partial Capacity Benefit.  I will continue to keep the Department&rsquo;s employment support schemes for people with disabilities, including the Wage Subsidy Scheme, under review to ensure that they continue to meet their policy objectives.  However, any potential changes to these schemes can only be considered as part of the wider budgetary context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300067#WRB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300067#WRB03250"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[29608\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300067#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of applications that have been received for the new &euro;1,000 enterprise support grant for the self-employed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[39965\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300067#WRB03350","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of self-employed persons who have benefited from the enterprise support grant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

However, CE participants who are working towards a major award or industry qualification can seek to extend participation by up to a further two years.  A significant number of CE participants each year avail of an extension in order to continue training and obtain qualifications or major awards.  <\/p><p>  The training attached to CE is recognised as a progression route for CE participants bringing them closer to the labour market.  The Department has no current plan to remove the training requirement as part of the qualifying criteria for CE or to remove any existing criterion.<\/p><p>  During the first phase of the Covid-19 emergency earlier this year, when the most restrictive measures were in place, the Department continued to provide the necessary funding for CE schemes.  Other contingency measures were also introduced, including the extension of those CE participant contracts that were due to come to an end during the lockdown period.<\/p><p>  Following the Government's introduction of Level-5 restrictions in October, the Department reintroduced these contingency arrangements and continued to provide funding for CE schemes.  Department officials have been liaising with CE schemes to arrange for those participants who were due to finish during the period Level-5 restrictions are in place, to have their contracts extended until restrictions ease, unless a participant is taking up employment or reaches the State Pension age.<\/p><p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.

It is unacceptable that so many of the children in our society continue to experience consistent poverty.<\/p><p>  The child-specific poverty target under the &quot;Brighter Outcomes Better Futures&quot; Framework is to lift over 70,000 children (aged 0-17 years) out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level (107,000 children). <\/p><p>  It is clear that, as we are now towards the end of 2020, this target will unfortunately not be reached.  <\/p><p>However, by 2013, the number of children in consistent poverty had actually risen to 150,000 children.

The Social Welfare Bill to give effect to this measure was published last week, and the Government has set aside a provision of &euro;221 million in 2021 to support this measure.<\/p><p>  The Commission's Terms of Reference includes the examination of sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  More broadly, it will also consider the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and consider how the pension system can further accommodate carers, who are predominantly women.  <\/p><p>  The membership of the Commission includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise.  In this regard, the membership also includes those with involvement in organisations supporting older people.  <\/p><p>  I was keen to ensure that the Commission had strong female representation in its membership, and I am pleased that the majority of members &ndash; 6 out of 11 &ndash; are women.  I am satisfied that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, is well equipped to grasp the potential impacts of any pensions reform options on affected groups, such as women, workers, and older people. <\/p><p>  The full details of the Commission's membership are available here:  <\/p><p>  As part of its work, the Commission has been asked to seek the views of recognised experts and representative\/advocacy groups by inviting submissions and\/or presentations.  The exact mechanisms for this process will be shaped by the Commission in due course.<\/p><p>  While this Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State's finances, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case.<\/p><p>  In line with the Programme for Government, the Commission will report to Government by 30 June of next year and the Government intends to take action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within 6 months.<\/p><p>  I hope this clarifies these matters for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300068#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":122,"content":"<p>Question No. 51 answered with Question No. 15.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":123,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 50.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":124,"content":"<p>Question No. 53 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300068#WRC02250"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[40074\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300068#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of disability study; if the disability allowance will be increased by &euro;20 as a temporary measure until the research by a company (details supplied) into the issue has been completed, as recommended by a federation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Whether people with disabilities would be best supported to meet the additional costs through the provision of services or if there should there be a specific income support payment so that people can offset extra costs themselves is a matter which will require detailed consideration across Departments.

A decision was made to delay the extension of the hot meals to January 2021 because of the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 Pandemic from 13 March 2020.

In order to ensure that these monies are properly spent my Department carries out a programme of reviews of entitlements across all schemes annually.  This is an appropriate control function to ensure that my Department can properly account for the monies it spends each year.<\/p><p>  As Deputies will be aware entitlement to payments from social welfare schemes can be subject to various conditions, depending on the particular scheme, and entitlement can also be subject to a means assessment.  These conditions form the basis for customers of the Department being required to notify the Department if there are any changes in circumstances which may affect their entitlement.<\/p><p>  My Department has examined the targets for control reviews in 2021 for the Working Family Payment (WFP) and One Parent Family Payment (OPFP) and consider that the current level of review is appropriate for the reasons outlined below:  <\/p><p>- Working Family Payment (WFP) - WFP entitlement, once awarded, is payable for a period of 52 weeks.  At end of each year a renewal application is sent to all recipients who must re-apply if they feel they still have an entitlement.  The renewal application includes a review of employment status and earnings to ensure continuing eligibility to the scheme.  In 2019, circa 56,000 renewal applications were issued and circa 47,000 re-applied for the scheme for another year. <\/p><p>One Parent Family Payment (OPFP) - OPFP claims are generally reviewed annually through a self-declaration process in order to: <\/p><p>- Ensure customers remain aware of the conditions of the scheme;<\/p><p>- Provide an opportunity for customers to notify the Department of any changes in their circumstances or employment that may affect their payment, and ensure that no overpayments arise, or to minimise any overpayment that might occur; and <\/p><p>- Provide an opportunity to ensure that customers are aware of any training, education, or employment opportunities that may be of interest.  In this respect it should be noted that many recipients of the One Parent Family payment are in employment and it is appropriate that my Department should provide regular employment supports and advice to such customers.<\/p><p>The vast majority of reviews on both OPFP and WFP are self-declaration reviews, and are desk-assessed by an officer.  However, it may sometimes be necessary to phone or interview customers for some clarification or further information on aspects of their self-declaration.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.<\/p><p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2020 is approximately &euro;919 million.  Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.  <\/p><p>Carer's Allowance is the primary income support provided by my Department to carers.  It is a means tested payment made to people whose income falls below certain limits, and who are looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention.  <\/p><p>  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  <\/p><p>  Current disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple, making the means test for carers the least onerous within the social protection system.  <\/p><p>  Carers may also (subject to certain conditions) qualify for the:<\/p><p>- Household Benefits Package<\/p><p>- Free Travel Scheme<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the substantial extra financial demands due to the COVID-19 crisis, I announced, on 4 June, that the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant would continue to be paid to carers this year at an estimated cost of over &euro;237 million.  The annual grant of &euro;1,700 is made to carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability regardless of their means or social insurance contributions and is not taxable.  <\/p><p>  The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs.  The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers.  At the end of October 115,845 carers had received the grant in respect of 128,610 care recipients.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2021 I have increased the rate of the grant by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850.  The new rate will be &euro;1,850 &ndash; the highest ever rate at which it will have been paid since its introduction. <\/p><p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme provides a &quot;safety net&quot; within the overall social welfare system and provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  SWA provides immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other schemes. <\/p><p>  As you are aware, the Government has approved the establishment of a Commission on Pensions.  The Commission&rsquo;s Terms of Reference includes consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependents can be accommodated within the State pension system.  The Commission will report to the Minister for Social Protection on its work, findings, options and recommendations by 30th June 2021.  The Government intends to take action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within six months of its report.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the current position, the State pension system gives significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role, through the award of credits and either the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (as part of the Yearly Average rate calculation method) or HomeCaring Periods (as part of the Interim TCA rate calculation method).<\/p><p>- Credits &ndash; PRSI Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.<\/p><p>- Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme - The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for the State Pension (Contributory).  The Scheme, which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to be disregarded (from 1994), can have the effect of increasing the Yearly Average.  <\/p><p>- HomeCaring Periods &ndash; This Scheme makes it easier for a home carer to qualify for a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory).  HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a  paid or credited social insurance contribution.  HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Interim TCA of pension calculation.  <\/p><p>The Homemaker's Scheme and HomeCaring Periods cannot be used together to calculate State Pension (Contribution) entitlement.  Furthermore those with few or no PRSI contributions paid over the years may alternatively qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), which is a means-tested pension, financed by the Exchequer, and paid at up to 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.<\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the commitment of family carers and the key role they play in society and I am very conscious of the particular challenges facing our family carers at this time.

Approximately 158,150, or 45% of the total in receipt of the support, are receiving the &euro;350 rate.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the 2020 earnings reference period to determine the rate of PUP was extended from February to the end of September 2020.  This measure benefitted over 37,400 recipients with increased payments since 17th November.<\/p><p>  Budget 2021 provided measures for self-employed recipients of PUP including the introduction of an earnings threshold of &euro;480 per month whereby a recipient can take up limited employment and retain PUP.  Where a person exceeds this threshold and is engaging in regular limited self-employment of up to 24 hours per week, access to the Part-Time Job Incentive has been extended to those who transition from the PUP.  Support may also be available under the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant which provides support of up to &euro;1,000 with business re-start cost.

The latest CSO data records a Covid-19 adjusted overall unemployment rate of 20.2 percent, with an equivalent measure for youth at just over 45 percent. <\/p><p>  With the second wave of Covid-19 and the subsequent introduction of Level 5 restrictions in October, there has been a rolling impact on the labour market bringing additional employment challenges.  There are currently over 350,000 persons in receipt of PUP from a peak number of over 600,000 in May 2020, to a low of 205,000 in October 2020.  Most of those currently on PUP will return to employment as restrictions ease and the economy re-opens.  However, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost, and additional numbers of persons will require State support to find new jobs.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware that when people lose their jobs and remain unemployed for some time they can become disconnected from the labour market.  These individuals risk losing the vital social and work connections that are needed to identify and pursue work opportunities and for many it may be the case that their existing work experience and skills cannot easily translate into new sectors of employment. <\/p><p>  My Department, and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are developing a range of educational, training and support measures to assist the unemployed on their journey back to work.  Measures announced under the July Jobs Stimulus included:<\/p><p>- Expanding the capacity of Intreo to provide enhanced employment services by assigning 100 Job Coaches by Q1 2021.  Job coaches will supplement the work of case officers by providing jobseekers with a personalised career development and guidance service, with the ultimate goal of securing employment. <\/p><p>- Increasing the capacity of contracted services by extending existing contracts for Local Employment Services, Jobpath and Employability into 2021 to ensure business continuity and services are in place to deal with increased demand.<\/p><p>- Expanding the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire people from the Live Register.  Promotion of this measure will resume when public health restrictions are eased.<\/p><p>- Providing access to additional fulltime and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.<\/p><p>- Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 for each new apprentice recruited.  By end September, over 3,000 new apprenticeships with over 600 employers were registered.<\/p><p>- Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic.  This has been done by waiving the usual qualification period of 3 &ndash; 9 months.  By end October, approx. 6,000 students had received support through the BTEA, and in excess of 3,000 self-employed individuals had received support through the BTWEA.<\/p><p>As part of the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department is also developing a work experience placement programme available for all those out of work for at least six months, including periods of time spent in receipt of PUP.  This programme, which will incorporate a training and development plan, will provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market.  I expect to launch the Programme in early 2021, subject to public health restrictions.<\/p><p>  In the New Year, my Department plans to commence engaging with PUP customers to initially provide them with information on the range of education, skills development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies and job search and assistance measures, that will help those who have lost their jobs find a new one, retrain, or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors.  It is anticipated that communication will commence on a phased basis, initially focusing on those in receipt of PUP for the longest periods of time. <\/p><p>  Work is at an advanced stage in my Department to develop Pathways to Work 2021-2025; the national employment services and activation strategy for the coming period.  The strategy will seek to build on the measures outlined under the July Jobs Stimulus to assist the unemployed with their journey back to work.  Publication is expected to follow the launch of the Government&rsquo;s National Economic Plan, in early 2021.  This will be a central element of the Government's response to the impact of COVID on the labour market and employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300069#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300069#WRD01850"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[40000\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300069#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the measures she will introduce to ensure that the free travel scheme will be available on all bus routes that are publicly licensed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>The Free Travel Scheme is currently available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, to carers and to customers under 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type payments.

The Men&rsquo;s Development Network and Men&rsquo;s Aid Ireland both offer a range of services to support male victims.

The organisation works at a national level to support male victims of domestic abuse. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has supported the organisation in providing this helpline since 2019. I understand that the Department of Justice provided extra funding of up to &euro;39,340 at the start of COVID-19 to extend the operating hours for the Male Advice Line and secure extra telephone support for the perpetrator programme, and to deliver a promotional campaign.<\/p>  <p>  Men&rsquo;s Aid Ireland is a service supporting men and their families experiencing domestic violence.

The basis for this referral to the Attorney derives from Section 38 (2) of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, and the obligation on me to consider whether publication of the final report might prejudice any criminal proceedings that are pending or in progress, and if so to apply to the Court for directions. The Attorney's views were sought to assist me in this consideration. <\/p>  <p>  I committed to publishing the report as soon as possible and the necessary considerations are being expedited to enable this to happen. It is essential that this is done in the right way with former residents being given the priority and support they deserve.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks I have spoken by telephone to a number of former residents and advocates in this area.  I have listened carefully to their views and concerns.  Many have cautioned me on the heightened sensitivities of publication of a report of this nature so close to Christmas. I am mindful too that the uncertainty around when those affected will be able to read the report could add to their anxiety. <\/p>  <p>  For these reasons, and in the hope of offering some reassurance, I am confirming today that I will bring a Memorandum to Government in the week of 11 January next, seeking approval to publish the Report immediately. I also intend to publish the Sixth Interim Report from the Commission at that time.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise how important it is that former residents and their families are the first to be notified of plans to publish the Report. In acknowledgement of this, I advised former residents earlier today of the planned publication arrangements through established channels. <\/p>  <p>  I know we will not have reached the many thousands with a connection to these matters, but it was important to do what was possible to ensure former residents are given the recognition and respect to which they are entitled.  I have also highlighted the counselling supports available to those who may feel they need additional support. <\/p>  <p>  Additional resources have been made available to the Health Service Executive in 2020 to put in place dedicated and enhanced counselling and patient advocacy services for former residents of these institutions.  Available capacity in these services will be primed to respond to the anticipated increased demand when the report is published. <\/p>  <p>  An information line has also been established in my Department and all relevant contact information is on my Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Act 2020 provides for the deposit of the Commission's database with Tusla, in addition to transferring a copy of this data, together with the Commission's entire archive of records, to me as the prescribed Minister. The archive will be transferred to my Department by 28 February next. Thereafter, my Department will be able to process subject access requests from people who wish to seek access to personal information that may be contained within these records. <\/p>  <p>  The database compiled by the Commission during the course of its investigation is a digital record of the mothers and children who spent time in 15 of the 18 institutions which were under investigation. This system will be an invaluable resource for Tusla now, and for whatever statutory body will be charged with information and tracing services into the future. The legislation also outlines the current restrictions placed on Tusla for the use of the database in delivering its services. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working intensively to ensure that it is prepared to appropriately manage subject access requests in respect of records within the archive and to provide people with as much personal data as possible. In that regard, my officials are also liaising with the Office of the Attorney General to clarify the nature of the balancing tests which must apply to the release of personal information, both under the GDPR itself as transposed by the Data Protection Act 2018, and under section 39 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, as amended by the Data Protection Act 2018. As certain records may contain mixed personal data, it is vital that my Department, in processing subject access requests, ensures that the rights of all parties are protected in accordance with law.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300070#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Poverty","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300070#WRE03650"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[40779\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300070#WRE03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he has read the report by an organisation (details supplied) that 100,000 children in Ireland are going to bed hungry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>Food poverty is defined as the inability to access a nutritionally adequate diet which is a significant issue for many people in Ireland.

The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), introduced in August, provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on numbers of eligible employees on payroll; and a reduced rate of employer PRSI. ELC and SAC services registered with Tusla are exempt from EWSS turnover requirements. The rate of subsidy was revised in October and early learning and childcare services with EWSS now have approximately 80% of their payroll costs covered, this is before they receive any parental income or funding from Government schemes. The EWSS thus allows early learning and childcare services to operate sustainably in a context of lower occupancy and higher delivery costs due to COVID-19, and without having to pass these additional costs on to parents.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS was one of many measures introduced in 2020 that have been highly successful in protecting the sector. Despite concerns expressed that hundreds of services would close, 99.9% of services have remained open with Government support. Measures included the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme, a Reopening Support Grant, a Capital Grant and the Covid-19 Sustainability Support Fund. This latter fund supports services whose viability is still negatively affected by the pandemic and for which all the other measures have proved inadequate. It is the first time that my Department&rsquo;s sustainability funding has been made available to both private and community providers. My Department also oversees a Case Management process through which local City and County Childcare Committees and Pobal support services in difficulty with expert advice and, in some circumstances, financial assistance.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to support for the sector generally, my Department continues to provide all subsidy schemes at capitation and subsidy rates that were recently proven by Crowe as appropriate to meet providers costs. These include the ECCE pre-school programme, the National Childcare Scheme and the outgoing schemes, the Community Childcare Subvention Plus Saver Programme and the Training and Employment Childcare Saver Programme. Since 2015, investment in the sector has increased by 141% enabling some providers to double in size. On average, services have grown from having 33 places to having 47 in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  One of my priorities is now to build on this and in delivering on the commitment in First 5 to double investment before 2028, I want to make sure we deliver on the objectives of affordability and quality with that investment. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to develop a new funding model which will set out how best to support quality, affordability and accessibility of services with additional investment. I am looking forward to the group's outputs next Autumn and welcome the research they have already published on international learning that will assist in decision making. <\/p>  <p>  In the coming weeks, I will receive an Interim Report from the Workforce Development Group. Their work will ultimately set out a plan to, for example, improve recruitment and retention, provide a career framework, make a career in the sector a respected and valued one,  and ensure that staff are encouraged to engage with continuous professional development.<\/p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, my Department has, over a number of years, provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions, for example, the increase in ECCE capitation in September 2018, &euro;19m in Programme Support Payments annually and twice the number of services in receipt of ECCE higher capitation than when it was introduced.  In addition, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to the creation of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector, which should offer a mechanism through which a pay agreement could be achieved. My officials are working closely with SIPTU, IBEC and other stakeholders to try to progress this as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the work of the Funding Model Expert Group and the Workforce Plan Development Group knitting together with a possible JLC to provide a systematic and comprehensive plan to achieve the best from investment over the coming years.

This initiative is additional to the Covid-related small grant scheme for the sector which was announced earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding allocated to youth services in 2021 will support the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide, with a particular view to the role played by youth services in supporting mental wellbeing, fostering resilience and developing the social and personal competencies of young people, including disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable young people. <\/p>  <p>  While I recognise and acknowledge that youth sector funding saw deep cuts during the preceding decade, in recent years funding for the provision of youth services has increased on an annual basis.

In recognition of the vital role played by youth work in providing such support to young people, funding levels have been maintained throughout the current challenging period and I have secured additional funding for 2021.  This will enable the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting this important sector, which has enormous value both to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300070#WRE07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300070#WRE07350"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[40439\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300070#WRE07400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps he is taking to take children out of the direct provision system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>Children who arrive into the State seeking International Protection are generally part of a family group or they arrive as unaccompanied minors.

They routinely identify vulnerabilities and assess applicants for any special reception needs to meet their accommodation requirements. This is especially the case for families with young children and for applicants with a disability. <\/p>  <p>  If a protection applicant chooses to accept an offer of accommodation from my Department, they will, in normal circumstances, be first brought to the National Reception Centre where medical screening and an orientation process is available over a period of 4 to 6 weeks.  They will be offered a health assessment by the on-site HSE team, which comprises a nurse, nurse specialist, area medical officer, general practitioners, social worker and psychologist. This allows for applicants to be assessed for any special reception needs that they may have before they are designated an accommodation centre.  The health screening provided is not mandatory and residents are free to decline the service.  If a person wishes to remain in accommodation provided by the International Protection Accommodation Service, he or she is allocated a place in a suitable longer-term centre at the end of the orientation and health screening period.  <\/p>  <p>  Safetynet, a primary care health service, carries out health screening, on behalf of the HSE, in a number of the temporary accommodation locations currently in use by the Department. The International Protection Accommodation Service works closely with the HSE screening team and with Safetynet to ensure that protection applicants are moved to locations where their medical needs can be met. They also work collaboratively to ensure that any special accommodation arrangements are in place as required.  Where more intensive healthcare needs are required, such cases are referred directly to the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  Discussions are ongoing between my Department officials and the HSE to enable formal vulnerability assessments for international protection applicants by the end of the year. This will ensure that a coherent process is in place for both the health and non-health aspects required in formalised assessments. <\/p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes and I look forward to the outcome of this research.<\/p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that in the case she refers to the individual concerned was allocated accommodation and was due to leave for the centre on Wednesday 18 November along with other residents.

It should be noted that at all times that accommodation and transport to that accommodation were available to the person in question and at no point was he left by the State without somewhere to live, and sleep at night.  <\/p>  <p>  After further consideration the applicant subsequently accepted an offer of accommodation in a quarantine centre in the East of the country while IPAS officials attempted to find an alternative accommodation solution.  Such centres offer additional wraparound services.  Psychosocial supports are also provided through a number of NGOs including the Jesuit Refugee Service, Peter McVerry Trust, etc to residents of such centres.   <\/p>  <p>  After a further review of available space across the network a new offer of accommodation was made to the applicant which was accepted and IPAS arranged the necessary transport to ensure the person in question arrived at their agreed destination safely.

Also, the rapid expansion we required in recent years, for example, to almost double ECCE places to accommodate a second year, has been delivered. <\/p>  <p>  Given my absolute priority to keep children safe, I have decided that first call on the 2021 funding will be given to ensuring fire safety in early learning and childcare services around the country.  <\/p>  <p>  Tulsa, the independent regulator of the sector, requires that providers submit a fire safety certificate as part of the statutory registration process.  Many services have already re-registered and submitted a fire safety certificate and some have re-registered subject to submitting an up to date Fire Safety Certificate in 2021.  Some services may need to carry out remedial works to receive a Fire Safety Certificate, but the costs for this can be prohibitive, especially in the current extenuating circumstances of COVID.  <\/p>  <p>  As such, my Department and Pobal will offer a Fire Safety Capital Grant in early 2021 to contribute towards the costs of required remedial works.

Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process, with the CCC administering initial, and on-going, case management assistance.

These applications are currently being assessed\u00a0for approval.\u00a0The relevant\u00a0information for the twelve local authorities who requested an application is provided in tabular form below.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority<\/th>       <th>Completed application<\/th>       <th>No. of Charge Points<\/th>       <th>Approval status<\/th>       <th>Charge points installed<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth County Council<\/td>       <td>Y<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>       <td>Pending<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council<\/td>       <td>Y<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>Pending<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City Council<\/td>       <td>N<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>My Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand.

Given Shannon Group operates in both these sectors, the impacts on the Group, in terms of its future strategic and financial outlook, have been severe.  <\/p>  <p>  Taking these factors into account, together with the importance of Shannon Airport to the Mid-West region, I considered it appropriate that my Department would undertake a review on the future viability of Shannon Group, including restructuring measures, financial supports and any other measures that may be necessary and appropriate including in relation to Shannon Heritage.  I intend to revert to Government with recommendations on this issue in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that prior to Covid-19 Shannon Group had been delivering on its commercial mandate and improving profitability. Since separation from daa, passenger numbers at the Airport had increased every year until 2019 when Shannon was particularly badly impacted by the global grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and more recently in relation to the impacts of COVID.  In recent years visitor numbers have increased at the tourist attractions operated by Shannon Heritage and the Group recorded and continues to record strong growth in its commercial property company. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Shannon Heritage, as I have previously advised, having considered the importance of Bunratty Castle and Folk Park and King John's Castle to the local economy and the region, from both a tourism and jobs perspective and given the unprecedented impact of Covid-19, a commitment was made to provide the incremental costs required to ensure that these two landmark tourist attractions, which were due to close at the end of August, could remain open to the end of 2020. However, since that commitment was given, new restrictions introduced to control COVID-19 meant that the sites had to close in October.   My Department is engaging with Shannon Group on the detail and conditions attaching to the funding necessary to provide the incremental costs of keeping the sites open to end 2020.  In that regard I understand that there will be an outdoor Christmas tourism offering at Bunratty Castle and Folkpark in line with public health restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  The position in relation to the opening of Shannon Heritage sites in 2021 is a matter for Shannon Group which operates its business on a commercial basis.  I also understand that Shannon Group has engaged at all times with its staff on the issues and difficulties being faced by the Company.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in recognition of the devastating impacts of Covid on Shannon Group, Government is providing almost &euro;30m in supports to the Group in 2020 and 2021.   I can assure the Deputy that Government recognises the strategic importance of Shannon Group to the economy of the Midwest region and indeed nationally and is confident that the supports provided to the Group will provide a solid financial foundation for the Group in 2021 and position it for recovery in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300072#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300072#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[40821\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300072#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department has been the subject of an investigation by the Data Protection Commission from 2016 to date; the number of specific investigations underway or completed; the dates on which his Department was first notified of the investigation; the details of the investigation; the nature of the complaints; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>My Department has not been subject to an investigation by the Data Protection Commission from 2016 to date. <\/p><p>The Department is firmly committed to ensuring compliance with its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation and to safeguarding the rights of individuals in relation to the processing of their personal data by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300072#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300072#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[40833\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300072#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the timeline for his introduction of e-scooter related legislation.","asker":"1572","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>I intend to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government in early 2021.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  <\/p>  <p>  The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC.<\/p>  <p>A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments to recommence I have brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation.

Under that Act, lenders are obliged to submit personal and credit information on loans of &euro;500 or more, and to enquire on the CCR when considering loan applications for &euro;2,000 or more.  Lenders may, if they wish, also enquire on the CCR when considering a loan application for less than &euro;2,000; if the borrower has sought a restructure; if a loan is in arrears; or if there has been a breach of the limit on a credit card or overdraft. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the impact of Covid-19 payment breaks on the CCR, the Central Bank has made it clear to all lenders that either a full or partial payment break agreed between a lender and a borrower as a response to Covid-19 is not, in itself, an event that is reportable to the CCR. Furthermore, it has also clarified that a payment break agreed between a lender and a borrower as a response to Covid-19 should not be reported to the CCR as either a &ldquo;missed payment&rdquo; or as a &ldquo;restructure event&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the impact on new lending, it should be noted that the information on a credit report provided by the CCR is factual in nature (and is, in turn, based on information provided to it by lenders) and it does not contains any guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit.  It remains a commercial matter for lenders, subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements governing the provision of credit to consumers and other borrowers, to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites.  Nevertheless, borrowers may wish to note that they may access their credit report free of charge (subject to fair usage) at www.centralcreditregister.ie.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Irish Credit Bureau, this is a private bureau and it falls outside of the regulatory remit of the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the number of Covid-19 payment breaks, recent data from the Banking Payments Federation of Ireland indicates that at the end of October approximately 153,000 Irish loans had availed of a Covid-19 payment break and that, of these, approximately 23,000 were active at that point.

It is co-ordinating the overall response to flood risk management on the Shannon informed by the assessment of flood risk carried out under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme and it is taking forward other initiatives to mitigate flooding on the Shannon.  <\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the Group has produced annual work programmes, which include co-ordinated focussed and prioritised actions and activities to manage flood risk for the Shannon catchment.  The work programme for 2020 is published and available at www.opw.ie.  Preparation is currently underway for the work programme for 2021, which will be published following its approval by the Working Group.<\/p>  <p>  The Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment and the scope of work undertaken to date includes: <\/p>  <p>  -  Completed targeted maintenance at five locations on the River Shannon which has enhanced the conveyance capacity and halted further deterioration of the channel.<\/p>  <p>  -  Completed a study to examine the removal of constrictions resulting in lower summer water levels through the Shannon Callows, to help address the summer flooding in the area while maintaining the appropriate navigation requirements.<\/p>  <p>  -  Completed a study to examine the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream of Parteen Weir in the Lower Shannon.<\/p>  <p>  -  Trialling the lowering of the lake levels on Lough Allen to help alleviate any significant flooding that may occur. <\/p>  <p>  -  Completed a preliminary assessment on the potential for strategic maintenance on the River Shannon.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2019, the Group agreed to a &euro;7 million strategic programme of maintenance works and the removal of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; on the bed of the River Shannon between Athlone and Meelick Weir, through the Callows region, to improve the conveyancing of the River Shannon.  This work will involve the full environmental assessments required to progress to the planning process for consent to proceed. This may influence the order of priority for undertaking the proposed works by Waterways Ireland, as the implementing body for the works.  The works will also be informed by public consultation.  <\/p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland has informed the OPW that it is advancing the various interventions, with work expected to commence at a number of locations in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The ESB manages the weirs, sluices and other works that are part of the Shannon Scheme, and the water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg. The levels in between the lakes are managed by Waterways Ireland for navigation purposes.  Both organisations are members of the Working Group and communicate on a daily basis to ensure a co-ordinated approach to managing water levels on the River Shannon.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the ESB that it is continuously monitoring the water levels throughout the Shannon Catchment and continues to operate in accordance with its regulations and guidelines for control of the River Shannon. In times of flood, ESB prioritises the safe passage of water over the generation of electricity. There has been less rainfall over the past week throughout the catchment following a sustained wet period. This has resulted in a reduction in water levels in the River Shannon and its tributaries. Lough Derg levels have reduced to within its normal operating band.<\/p>  <p>  Discharge at Parteen Weir down the old River Shannon Channel was reduced on Monday 30th November from 55m3\/s to the statutory compensation flow of 10m3\/s.  Ardnacrusha Station is operating at full throughput; that is discharges are 350-400m3\/s. Discharging more water than current would result in lowering water levels in Parteen Basin below safe operating limits with the risk of causing stability issues to the Earthen Embankment Dams that form Parteen Basin. ESB can only manage the flow of water as it arrives at Parteen Weir from Lough Derg. The water flow from Lough Derg to Parteen Basin is restricted by the flow capacity of the outlet channel from Lough Derg at Killaloe. The capacity restriction acts like a bottleneck limiting the discharge from Lough Derg. ESB is maximising the discharge of water from Lough Derg within the Dam Safety constraints. <\/p>  <p>  Should further rain occur, water levels in Lough Derg will rise, which will result in increased water flow to Parteen Weir; that situation will necessitate further discharge from Parteen Weir down the old river Shannon channel. Predicted water levels and expected discharge amounts based on the latest Met &Eacute;ireann forecast can be found on the ESB&rsquo;s twice weekly Shannon Forecast available to view at: www.esb.ie\/our-businesses\/generation-energy-trading-new\/hydrometric-information\/river-shannon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300073#WRH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300073#WRH05100"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[40979\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300073#WRH05200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of works on sluice gates in a location (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works has no responsibility for the sluice gates in question as they are located in a channel that forms part of a Drainage District that is under the auspices of Kerry County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300073#WRH05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300073#WRH05500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300073#WRH05400"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[40937\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300073#WRH05500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if art galleries will be allowed open with health and safety precautions in place when the public health restrictions change.","asker":"1467","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s medium-term Strategy <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-1<\/i>9, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19, in a range of areas, over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.<\/p><p>The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.<\/p><p>As announced on 27 November, art galleries may re-open from 1 December 2020 with protective measures.

These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF). This year I also introduced the Community Monuments Fund (CMF) for conservation and other works at our national monuments. <\/p><p>The BHIS is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals. The HSF is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures and historic buildings, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public.  <\/p><p>This year 450 heritage projects across every county in the country have benefited from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under BHIS and HSF. An extra &euro;1m in funding was secured for built heritage projects under the July Jobs Stimulus Package 2020, which aims to offset some of the effects of Covid-19. This funding supplements 28 BHIS and HSF projects and supported 12 new ones, in addition to capital works by the Heritage Council and the Irish Heritage Trust.<\/p><p>I recently launched the BHIS and HSF for 2021, with a combined allocation of &euro;6m, an increase of nearly 40%. Full details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on the website of each local authority and the deadline for applications is 29 January 2021.<\/p><p>A further &euro;1 million in funding was approved nationally for the Historic Towns Initiative 2020, which is a joint initiative of my Department and the Heritage Council. The Historic Towns Initiative is a dedicated programme for the heritage-led regeneration of historic towns.  In total &euro;1.3m has been awarded in 2020 for heritage led regeneration in the following towns.  This includes &euro;300k allocated under the July Jobs Stimulus scheme.<\/p><p>-  Tralee, Co. Kerry<\/p><p>-  Ramelton, Co. Donegal  <\/p><p>-  Ballina, Co. Mayo  <\/p><p>-  Roscommon, Co. Roscommon<\/p><p>-  Sligo, Co. Sligo<\/p><p>-  Clones, Co. Monaghan<\/p><p>-  Callan, Co. Kilkenny<\/p><p>Details of the Historic Towns Initiative 2021 will be announced shortly. <\/p><p>The Heritage Council also has a role in allocating funding to heritage sites across the country through its own grant schemes. It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how this funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources. Grant schemes for 2020 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie. <\/p><p>My Department also announced a call for projects in September under a new fund, the Community Monuments Fund (CMF) for investment in our archaeological heritage, which is being funded under a special provision of &euro;1.4 million under the July Jobs Stimulus Package. The CMF is prioritised for local authorities, private owners and custodians, and community groups for the care, maintenance, protection and promotion of local monuments and historic sites and the provision of any required measures to ensure safe access during the Covid-19 pandemic.  A total of 69 CMF projects nationally are being supported this year.

Measures include all post-primary students wearing masks, all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses.

It is essential that this is done in the right way with former residents being given the priority and support they deserve.  Unfortunately, information which appeared in media last weekend was speculative and not accurate.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened carefully to the views and concerns of the former residents and advocates that I have had the opportunity to engage with directly by telephone. Many have cautioned me on the heightened sensitivities of publication of a Report of this nature so close to Christmas. I am mindful too that the uncertainty around when they will be able to read the Report may add to the anxiety of some. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the views of former residents, and in the hope of offering some reassurance, I have confirmed that I will bring a memorandum to Government in the week of the 11th January seeking approval to publish the Report.  Former residents and their families were the first to be notified of the planned timeframe for publication of the Report. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am committed to strong, ongoing engagement with key stakeholders once the report has been published and everyone has an opportunity to absorb the Commission's detailed analysis and findings. Former residents and their families are central to this process. It is their lived experiences which are reflected in this investigation so it is essential that they are central to decisions to be taken in advancing the State's response to these matters.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of preparations to support former residents, my Department has a dedicated telephone information line available to any person seeking further information in relation to these issues. Relevant contact details are available on my Department's website. Contact details are also provided for the National Counselling Service and other supports for persons who feel they may need professional counselling services.  Additional resources were made available to the Health Service Executive in 2020 to put in place dedicated and enhanced counselling and advocacy services for former residents of these institutions. My officials have liaised with the Department of Health and the National Counselling Service to ensure that available capacity is primed to respond to the anticipated increased demand for its services. Relevant contact details have been provided to former residents and their supporters on a number of occasions and this information will be communicated again when the report is being published. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300076#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300076#WRL03400"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[40796\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300076#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will report on the inspection carried out in September 2020 of a direct provision centre (details supplied) by the International Protection Accommodation Service; the timeline for the publication of the report; the actions he will take regarding the findings of the inspection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>The Inspection process involves a site visit and follow up correspondence with centre management to alert the management company to any issues which need addressing.  <\/p><p>The report of the inspection to the centre referred to by the Deputy has recently been completed and sent to the centre's management for comment prior to finalisation.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The existing wardship system will come to an end within three years of the commencement of that Act. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has, through the Estimates process, sought and received increased funding in 2021, bringing its budget to &euro;5.8 million for the year, to allow the DSS to work towards the commencement of services in mid-2022. In the interim, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan that anticipates the commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project. In tandem with this work, progress is also being made to finalise the amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to streamline the processes envisaged under the 2015 Act and to support the DSS to become operational.  It is not possible to indicate a precise date for the publication of the Bill at this point but I am pressing for publication of the Bill as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300076#WRL03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300076#WRL04000"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[40805\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300076#WRL04100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if his Department has been the subject of an investigation by the Data Protection Commission from 2016 to date; the number of specific investigations underway or completed; the dates on which his Department was first notified of the investigation; the details of the investigation; the nature of the complaints; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Department has been the subject of one investigation by the Data Protection Commission since 2016.

The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) is our key framework for policy and action in this regard. The NDIS takes a whole of Government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities and creating the best possible opportunities for people them to fulfill their potential. The NDIS Steering Group oversees the implementation of the Strategy. The Group is chaired by the Minister of State with Responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte T.D., and meets quarterly. It includes representatives of Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and members of the Disability Stakeholder Group.<\/p>  <p>  A mid-term review of the NDIS was published earlier this year. This was completed following consultation with disability stakeholders, relevant departments and agencies.  Stakeholders indicated that they want to see the focus for the next years on implementing existing commitments in the Strategy.  They are particularly interested in the implementation of the obligations that arise from Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  Advancing the implementation of the UN Convention will be a priority. Our approach to meeting the obligations of the Convention is one of progressive realisation, each year moving forward on key reforms.  The important steps in implementing the Convention are to commence the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act, 2015, to enact the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and to enable the Decision Support Service (DSS) to become operational. These reforms will expand the rights in particular of those with capacity difficulties.  I am pleased to have secured an increased budget of &euro;5.8m for the DSS for 2021 which will enable it to open for business in 2022 as agreed.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will submit its initial State Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities shortly.  A consultation process to inform that Report is being launched today by my colleague Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte, T.D.  As we continue to advance the implementation of the Convention, it is absolutely vital that Government hears the voices of people with lived experience of disability. The experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities are essential to the development of policies and programmes that meet their needs effectively.  That is why we are providing Government funding to establish a Disability Participation and Consultation Network as one of the actions to fulfil the Convention. The aim of the Network is to provide a new opportunity for persons with disabilities to be involved in the development of policy and legislation. One of the Network&rsquo;s first tasks will be to bring the voices of people with disabilities into consultations on Ireland&rsquo;s first State Report to the UN on our progress in implementing the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  The third strategic priority for the Government in the area of disability is the continued implementation of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (2015-2024).  The CES sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to work, are supported and enabled to do so.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to improving the services provided to people with disabilities. Budget 2021 provides for an unprecedented level of investment in disability services, with the investment of &euro;100m for new initiatives in 2021.  In addition to the funding announced for 2021, &euro;20 million once off funding in 2020, has been made available for disability voluntary service providers engaged in the HSE Transforming Lives Reform programme. The increased level of funding in 2021 will enable us to build on initiatives currently underway. Funding will be targeted at five key areas: children&rsquo;s services, day services, community supports, residential services, and disability integration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Support Services","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM00900"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[40998\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the full extent of proposed investment in integration over the next five years; the progress to date in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":614,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to the development and nurturing of an all-inclusive society in Ireland.

It contains 76 actions which are delivered by Government Departments, local authorities, local communities, the business sector, sporting and arts organisations and NGOs across a number of policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including employment; education and social inclusion. It also addresses racism and xenophobia, representing a whole-of-Government approach.While the Strategy was due to run until the end of 2020 I have decided to extend it until the end of 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its implementation<\/p><p>A number of funding streams are supporting the integration of migrants. These include - <\/p><p>- A National Funding Programme to promote the Integration of migrants. Grants are spread over three years to support the implementation of these projects.  The National Integration Fund 2020 was launched on 11 August 2020 with funding of almost &euro;2.2 million available over a three year period.  The Fund supports communities to promote the integration of migrants and their children into Irish society  and selected projects will help to combat racism and xenophobia.<\/p><p>- The Communities Integration Fund supports local initiatives and 114  projects have received a total of just under &euro;500,000 from the 2020 fund.  The Fund has been in place since 2017.<\/p><p>- Funding from European sources, including the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). The 2019 AMIF  allocation provided funding of &euro;4,487,919 to 19 projects. The 2019 European Social Fund (ESF) allocation provided funding of &euro;3,288,498 to 5 projects. <\/p><p>In addition, I am very pleased to have secured an additional &euro;0.6m for Refugee and Migrant Integration for 2021. This increase of almost 10% in funding will support initiatives aimed at meeting the needs of refugees and migrants.  It will also allow the Irish Refugee Protection Programme to continue its work to resettle refugees from areas of international conflict, particularly Syria.  <\/p><p>As Government funding in this area is allocated on a yearly basis it is not possible to indicate what the total level of funding will be over the coming five years. <\/p><p>The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) new programming period will commence in 2021 and will run until 2027.  The fund is split over a number of specific objectives, namely:<\/p><p>- Asylum and Integration<\/p><p>-  Returns<\/p><p>- Special Cases \/ Resettlements<\/p><p>Ireland, as with other EU Member States, does not expect to know the allocations available to it for integration activities under that Fund until February 2021.  <\/p><p>In addition, mainstream funding is used to promote integration across a range of policy areas such as in relation to health and education. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":615,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01200"},{"type":"question","counter":616,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[40999\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to liaise with the various youth organisations throughout the country including an organisation (details supplied) with the objective of identifying the extent to which support continues to be made available in accordance with the wishes of the organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[41000\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of applications for support received from the various youth organisations throughout the country in 2020 to date; the response proposed or ongoing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[41006\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which he continues to be in direct contact with youth organisations in an effort to update their requirements in terms of funding or other supports in 2020 to date; his proposals for further support on the basis of dialogue entered into; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266, 267 and 273 together.<\/p><p>My Department provides a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities. I am committed to supporting this important sector, which has enormous value both to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint.  <\/p><p>My Department maintains close contact with the national youth organisations funded under the Youth Service Grant Scheme and I, and officials from my Department, meet formally with these organisations twice a year to share knowledge and information on developments in the youth sector (this schedule has been affected in 2020 by Covid-19). <\/p><p>In addition, my officials hold quarterly meetings attended by all Youth Officers from across the country. Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards (ETB) provide an important support role to my Department in the co-ordination and administration of youth services at local level. These meetings assist my Department in identifying service needs and emerging issues, particularly for vulnerable young people.  The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department has set up a working group with five Youth Officers focussed on strategic planning for future capital funding for the youth sector.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department also meet with youth organisations on an individual basis when the need arises. <\/p><p>In recent months, key representatives from the youth sector have met with my officials regularly to continuing to assist in developing and updating sector-specific guidance for youth organisations in relation to provision of services during the pandemic, in line with the Government's <i>Resilience and Recovery <\/i>Roadmap.  <\/p><p>In recognition of the vital role played by these services in supporting young people at this time, funding has been maintained throughout this challenging period. The overall budget allocation for the youth sector in my Department for 2020 is &euro;61.79 million in current funding, in addition to a further &euro;3 million  in capital funding.  Furthermore, I recently secured an additional amount of &euro;1m capital funding in 2020 to support ICT procurement in the youth sector before year end. This sum is in addition to the Covid-related small grant scheme for the sector announced earlier this year.<\/p><p>I have secured an additional &euro;5 million in current funding for youth services nationally as part of Budget 2021.  My officials are currently working on the apportionment of these funds in the context of the publication of the Revised Estimates Volume. As part of the Budget 2021 announcements, the youth sector has also been allocated a capital sum of &euro;3m. <\/p><p>This additional funding allocated to youth services in the coming year will support the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide with a particular view to the role played by youth services in supporting mental wellbeing, fostering resilience and developing the social and personal competencies of young people, including disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable young people.  <\/p><p>In relation to particular requests for support from youth organisations, organisations have in 2020 submitted applications directly to the Department under the following various schemes: <\/p><p>- 252 applications for funding under the <i>UBU Your Place, Your Space <\/i>scheme<\/p><p>- 30 applications from National Youth Organisations under the Youth Services Grant Scheme <\/p><p>- 25 National Youth Organisations received capital funding based on applications for funding<\/p><p>- 14 youth organisations received funding under the Youth Climate Justice Fund, based on applications for funding<\/p><p>- Two other organisations which provide supports to young people , L&eacute;argas and Gaisce - the President's Award, also applied for and received direct funding from my Department.<\/p><p>In relation to the particular youth service specified by the Deputy, <i>UBU<\/i>funding for Kildare projects in 2020 amounts to &euro;246,705; a further &euro;246,703 was allocated for the Targeted Youth Funding Scheme (TYFS), and &euro;50,759 was provided for Youth Information Centres in the county.<\/p><p>My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the <i>UBU<\/i>Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas. <\/p><p>Kildare &amp;amp; Wicklow ETB, which act on behalf of my Department in administering youth funding in that area, receives funding for Technical Assistance and Youth Work Functions (&euro;190,000 in 2020).  It administers the Local Youth Club Funding Scheme, the LBGTI+ funding scheme and the Covid 19 Small grants scheme (&euro;158,500; &euro;4,000 and &euro;3,000 respectively in 2020).  The Kildare &amp;amp; Wicklow ETB also administers the 2020 Capital funding scheme for the area which amounted to just over &euro;20,000 in total.<\/p><p>A key tenet of the <i>UBU<\/i>scheme is the production of evidence of local need. In allocating funding under the scheme, each ETB carries out an Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service requirement process. This process draws upon quantitative and qualitative information to objectively identify the needs of young people within the ETB&rsquo;s functional area. This analysis leads to the development of a Service Requirement, which is then used as the basis for discussion between ETBs and service providers in terms of service delivery to meet the needs of young people in the area. This approach ensures that we can target supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated on the basis of evidenced need.<\/p><p>Kildare &amp;amp; Wicklow ETB is there to support the Youth Service in implementing the Service Requirement of the area and its Youth Officer meets regularly with the Youth Service to this end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Childcare Scheme","counter":620,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01800"},{"type":"question","counter":621,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[41001\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to meet in full or in part childcare support applications from cr&egrave;ches and parents; his proposals to further enhance the funding available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":622,"content":"<p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) was introduced in November 2019.

The maximum number of subsidised hours available to families has increased from September 2020. Parents in work, study or training can now avail of up to 45 subsidised hours of childcare per week. Parents not in work, study or training can avail of up to 20 subsidised hours of childcare per week.<\/p>  <p>  NCS subsidies can be used in any registered childcare provider that has contracted to provide the NCS in their service.<\/p>  <p>  Over 2,900 childcare providers have contracted to provide the NCS in their service.

The Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19, which was launched by the then Taoiseach in July 2018, sets out the rage of actions and activities underway across six key Government Departments ((the then named) Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business, Enterprise and Innovation) to keep children and adults safe online. <\/p><p>Children First operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan, in January 2019 my Department published an addendum to the Children First National Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements. In addition, Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.<\/p><p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth provides funding to three national youth organisations which provide online safety resources for the youth sector. The National Youth Council of Ireland provides the Web Safety in Youth Work Resource, SpunOut has developed an Online Safety Hub which provides guidelines for young people on online safety and Youth Work Ireland, in conjunction with McAfee Security, has developed a digital safety programme which highlights the risks associated with online activity. Further detail below:<\/p><p>- The Web Safety in Youth Work Resource is produced by the National Youth Council of Ireland and is a component of its child protection programme. It is a resource intended to support those who work with young people in small and large youth organisations to ensure that young people, staff, volunteers and organisations are safe while online.<\/p><p>- Spunout.ie which is funded by the Department under the Youth Service Grant Scheme has developed an Online Safety Hub which provides guidelines on online safety, privacy and security for young people on all the main social media platforms as well as messaging, gaming and dating apps\/sites.<\/p><p>- In September 2017 the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs launched a new Digital Safety Programme, which is a collaboration between Youth Work Ireland and McAfee Security. The programme teaches school-aged children how to safely access the internet via digital devices, with topics including online security, accessing social media safely and cyberbullying.<\/p><p>As part of the government response to Covid-19, in April, the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs launched a range of supports for parents and children to support them during this challenging time. This included a new online gov.ie resource for parents, entitled &lsquo;Parents Centre&rsquo; <\/p><p>() which brings together high quality information and online resources for parents into one portal. Parents Centre provides links to a wide variety of material including around learning, parenting and supports that are available. It also includes links to Webwise, an initiative of the Department of Education, which is the key internet safety online access point for parents in Ireland.  As a response to Covid-19, the Webwise Parents Hub has been updated with online safety advice for parents, including around screen time as well as with the publication of &lsquo;A Parent&rsquo;s Guide for a Better Internet&rsquo;, covering topics including managing technology use at home, social networking tips and dealing with cyberbullying. <\/p><p>Bullying in schools is a particular problem due to the fact that children spend a significant portion of their time there. In the first instance, the school authorities are responsible for dealing with such bullying. School management boards must have a code of behaviour and an anti-bullying policy in place. A range of resources are available on the website of the Department of Education to assist parents, young people and schools to deal with bullying and cyberbullying <\/p><p>The Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future<\/i>, commits to the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation (OSMR) Bill and the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner.  The general scheme of the OSMR Bill 2019, which has the aim of regulating harmful content and creating a safer environment online for all users, including children and young people, was approved by Government and published by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in January 2020. <\/p><p>Online safety codes will deal with a wide range of issues, including measures to be taken by online services to tackle the availability of harmful online content, for example cyberbullying material, on their services. The Online Safety Commissioner will also have a role in promoting positive digital citizenship among children and young people, in conjunction with Webwise and other educational partners, schools, as well as the Ombudsman for Children. The Commissioner will also develop a research programme led by internationally recognised experts to review the existing and developing literature in relation to the consequences, benefits and potential harms to society and especially children, of digital activity and the concept of duty of care and the public interest in the design of online platforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"After-School Support Services","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM02700"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[41004\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300077#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the degree to which he remains satisfied regarding the availability of community child support services including the provision of support for afterschool activities through youth clubs and similar bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>I want to assure the Deputy of my commitment to supporting young people and their families, particularly at the present challenging time. <\/p><p>Structured services and activities, such as those provided by the youth sector, play an important role for young people,  supporting their development, and fostering their wellbeing and resilience.

This informed the Childcare Support Act which was debated and progressed through both Houses of the Oireachtas in 2018. The Oireachtas Committee on Children and Youth Affairs also led very helpful discussion on the objectives and merit of the proposed scheme.<\/p><p>Better outcomes for children is the primary objective both in the 2016 policy paper and the scheme design. The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.These objectives are inherently interrelated and sustain each other.<\/p><p>The policy was informed by national and international evidence and advocacy on measures to prevent poverty (including inter-generational poverty). The policy sought to strike the right balance between enabling early learning and care services, or indeed school age childcare services, to meet the needs of children in terms of their positive development, and, tackling a significant contributor to poverty and poorer outcomes for children that of non-work households.<\/p><p>There is strong evidence that growing up in poverty has negative impacts on child outcomes. For example, according to the ESRI study <i>Understanding Childhood Deprivation in Ireland<\/i>(Watson et al., 2012), the longer-term impacts of poverty among children include lower levels of educational achievement, emotional and behavioural problems, and poorer health outcomes.<\/p><p>The research evidence suggests that parental employment is a key factor in protecting children from poverty and deprivation. The ESRI \/ Watson study concluded that parental unemployment is a significant risk factor in determining deprivation rates among children, with particularly high deprivation rates where a parent has never worked, or in lone parent households, or where the mother has no educational qualifications. <\/p><p>Childcare costs in Ireland (prior to the NCS) have been found to be a significant factor in contributing to low levels of participation in employment, education and training for mothers, particularly for lone parents. The NCS makes childcare much more affordable, and in some instances free to parents.<\/p><p>The NCS policy paper highlighted the dangers of poverty traps in childcare schemes, particularly where there is a risk of steep rises in childcare costs where a parent returns to work. Such traps undermine the incentive to take-up or increase employment.  Therefore the NCS was designed to counteract this disincentive effect, through a smooth taper rate across the income assessed subsidies, and also through a transition from unemployment to work\/study which increases the number of hours available.<\/p><p>Also referenced in the NCS policy paper is research by Melhuish et al. (2015) and Sylva et al. (2004), which indicates that positive children&rsquo;s outcomes are for the most part met through part-time participation. This research has been used internationally in the design of various interventions. (DCEDIY is extremely grateful to have one of those authors, Prof Melhuish from Oxford University, on the Funding Model Expert Group.)  <\/p><p>Melhuish and Sylva's research points to the fact that young children do not need to be in early learning and care for full time hours to meet their child development needs. As such, many schemes around the world are based on 15 to 20 hours per week. In Ireland's case, the State is now providing two years of free pre-school to all children before they start school for 15 hours per week. The NCS  provides 20 hours of subsidised early learning and care per week where a parent is available at home, for children aged from six months, or 20 hours of school age childcare in non- term\/ non ECCE time. <\/p><p>The OECD&rsquo;s 2017 study Faces of Joblessness in Ireland, which included an ex ante analysis of the impact of the National Childcare Scheme, stressed the impact of work incentives on joblessness. It reported positively on the likely impact of the NCS. The study noted <\/p><p><i>For those with low earnings&hellip;who need to purchase childcare in order to work full time, a large proportion of potential earnings would be lost to higher taxes, withdrawn benefits or childcare costs&hellip;. A new childcare support scheme will be introduced shortly to provide subsidies to lower-income families where both adults work. This scheme will strengthen work incentives for those in low-income families, particularly for lone parents with lower earnings&hellip;<\/i><\/p><p>Dominic Richardson and Jonathan Bradshaw in Family Orientated Anti-Poverty Measures in Developed Countries note that:<\/p><p><i>Children in families with low work intensity have a much higher risk of<\/i><\/p><p><i>income poverty &ndash; an unsurprising finding given the important role of employment<\/i><\/p><p><i>and earned income in the protection from income poverty. For both income<\/i><\/p><p><i>poverty and deprivation, low work intensity presents the highest risk factor of all.<\/i><\/p><p><i>With the exception of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania child deprivation rates are<\/i><\/p><p><i>at least double the average in families with adults working very little.<\/i><\/p><p>Households on incomes of less than &euro;26,000 NET can access full subsidies of up to &euro;225 per child, per week, covering up to 45 hours week. To access 45 hours rather than 20 hours, the parent must be in some type of employment or be engaged in training. The training can be as little as 2 hours per week on a recognised Level 1 NFQ course. In this way, the NCS encourages parents to exit poverty and deliver better outcomes for their children.<\/p><p>For children living in exceptional circumstances of disadvantage or need, the NCS sponsorship arrangement is designed so that they can access free early learning and care or school age childcare for longer or full time hours where required. More information is available on NCS.gov.ie<\/p><p>The DCEDIY is committed to keeping the scheme under review and to assess whether it is meeting its objectives.  A 12 month review will begin shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300078#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":667,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300078#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":668,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[41044\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300078#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of SAC children granted zero hours term-time since September 2020; and the number under NCS.","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>For this question, &lsquo;school aged children&rsquo; has been defined as any child aged 4 years or more on 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 2020.

The then Minister of State received many representations from a range of stakeholders at the time and these were extensively discussed and publicised.<\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Act is an interim reform measure pending the comprehensive reform of gambling. It modernises the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and will help the better promotion of local gaming and lottery activity held primarily for charitable and philanthropic purposes, and which are an important source of funding to sporting clubs and community organisations across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy, if I understand correctly, asks about the interaction of amended section 4(1) of the Principal Act of 1956 &ndash; inserted by section 3 of the Act of 2019 - which restates the prohibition on gaming without a permit or licence and new section 9A of the Principal Act of 1956 Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Act of 2019. <\/p>  <p>  New section 9A provides for a modernised system of gaming permits, without distinction on any particular location or type of gaming (e.g. card games, pool, darts, etc.). Permits would be issued by the Garda Superintendent for the relevant district and have a maximum validity of 12 months. In any one game, the maximum stake is &euro;10 and maximum prize &euro;3,000. This updates the previous 1956 limits of 3 cent and 50 cent for gaming at carnivals, circuses, etc. The gaming may be promoted for charitable or philanthropic benefit, or for the personal benefit of the promoter.<\/p>  <p>  The Gaming and Lotteries Act is essentially concerned with physical forms of gaming taking place at a premises. However, the provisions of the Act make no reference to the online or remote promotion of gaming (where participation in the game is possible), or a mixture of both physical and online promotion and participation. Such online promotion might involve, for example, some form of card games, quizzes, etc. that might not strictly require a physical presence. However, the suitability of the premises from which the gaming is being promoted would be subject to consideration by the Garda Superintendent to whom the application for a Gaming Permit is made. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has made a major commitment in the Programme for Government to the modernisation of our licensing and regulatory environment for all gambling activities. The development of modern gambling legislation is a priority. This reform includes a new independent gambling regulator to enforce necessary and appropriate licensing and regulatory measures in respect of all gambling activities, including online. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway in my Department on the drafting of a General Scheme of a new Bill to provide for the modern licensing and regulatory provisions for the gambling industry. That work will involve a major updating of the proposals of the General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill 2013. I hope to be in a position to bring proposals in that regard to Government next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Appointments","counter":731,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO01500"},{"type":"question","counter":732,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[40870\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if and the number of times she discussed or communicated with the former Attorney General; the status of the person&rsquo;s recommendation from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board for appointment to the Supreme Court vacancy occasioned by the retirement of a person (details supplied); if the possibility of the incoming Government nominating them for appointment to the Supreme Court was mentioned; the nature of any such discussions and communications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":733,"content":"<p>I did not communicate with, or discuss any aspect of the appointment to the Supreme Court vacancy with the former Attorney General in advance of the Government decision of the 15th of July. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[40871\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if and the number of times she discussed or communicated with the former Minister for Justice matters in relation to the Supreme Court vacancy occasioned by the retirement of a person (details supplied); if the interest of the former Attorney General in being nominated for appointment to that position was mentioned; if a postponement of the previous Government&rsquo;s decision on the nomination was mentioned; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":736,"content":"<p>I have at no point discussed judicial appointments with my predecessor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[40872\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if and the number of times she discussed or communicated with the current T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment issues in relation to filling the Supreme Court vacancy occasioned by the retirement of a person (details supplied); if the interest of the former Attorney General in being nominated for appointment to that position was mentioned; if he indicated his own preference in relation to the matter; if so, if he sought the Minister&rsquo;s agreement; the nature of any such discussions or communications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>I have previously given a full account of all matters related to the filling of the Supreme Court vacancy during the Statements and Questions and Answers on Judicial Appointments held in the D&aacute;il on 26 November last. <\/p>  <p>  During the debate I informed the House that in the days following my appointment as Minister for Justice on 27 June I had an informal conversation with the T&aacute;naiste and he informed me that there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court and that S&eacute;amus Woulfe SC had come through that process.

Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. <\/p><p>However in all cases, grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority<\/th>       <th>Name of Applicant<\/th>       <th>Nr.of Camera's<\/th>       <th>Grant approval<\/th>       <th>Maintenance Grant<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim County Council<\/td>       <td>Carrick on Shannon<\/td>       <td>11<\/td>       <td>&euro;40,000.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council<\/td>       <td>Wexford County Council<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>&euro;25,675.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow County Council<\/td>       <td>Arklow Town, Wicklow<\/td>       <td>11<\/td>       <td>&euro;40,000.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council<\/td>       <td>Courttown\/Riverchapel<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>&euro;28,636.05<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council<\/td>       <td>Gorey Town Park<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>&euro;23,603.46<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick -Newcastlewest<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>&euro;31,071.33<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo County Council<\/td>       <td>Cranmore Regeneration Sligo<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>&euro;8,835.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Castleconnell<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>&euro;27,310.22<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Askeaton<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>&euro;28,115.54<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Abbeyfeale<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>&euro;22,800.94<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Kilmallock<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>&euro;30,370.01<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Rathkeale<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>&euro;34,172.66<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Adare<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>&euro;22,406.01<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Caherconlish<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>&euro;16,481.38<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Croom<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>&euro;19,277.12<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Murroe<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>&euro;21,945.33<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Pallasgreen<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>&euro;18,691.09<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Cappamore<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>&euro;14,218.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Patrickswell<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>&euro;30,363.85<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council<\/td>       <td>Limerick - Foynes<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>&euro;17,349.85<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan County Council<\/td>       <td>Monaghan Town<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>&euro;40,000.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;5,000.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny Co.

These experiences can be devastating for those affected.<\/p>  <p>  Harassment and abuse in any form, whether online or otherwise, is utterly unacceptable and has no place in Irish society. I am, along with my Government colleagues, fully committed to tackling abusive behaviour in all forms. The standards of what is unacceptable in an online setting must be consistent with those in traditional settings, and cross government initiatives to ensure we have modern approaches to deal with these modern challenges are underway. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years, a whole-of-government response was taken to addressing these complex issues, in particular through the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018 - 2019 which identified a range of positive actions to address online safety issues, including cyber-bullying. There has been a general consensus in recent years that the appropriate response to addressing such online issues is one that encompasses educational and awareness raising campaigns, as well as effective actions and policies on the part of internet companies.<\/p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I are working to update existing legislation and where necessary to introduce new laws, to provide appropriate and robust legislation to deal with behaviour that should be criminalised whether engaged in online or offline. <\/p>  <p>  I am prioritising the enactment of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill sponsored by Deputy Brendan Howlin.  I have been working with Deputy Howlin to progress this Bill as a priority in line with commitment contained in the Programme for Government. <\/p>  <p>  Having secured cabinet approval for a number of amendments to the Bill, this week it passed through Committee Stage and I am confident, given the cross party support for its enactment, that it will complete the legislative process before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is silent on the types of technology that may be used to commit the offences provided for under the Bill. It is intentionally neutral to cover all forms of online and offline communications that cause harm to a victim. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill proposes to amend the current offence of harassment in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 by broadening the scope of the offence to cover persistent communications to or about a person. The maximum penalty for this offence will be increased from 7 years&rsquo; to 10 years&rsquo; to reflect the harm caused by the most serious forms of harassment. <\/p>  <p>   In addition to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and other Related Offences Bill, separate legislation to include provision for an online safety commissioner has been proposed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, which published the General Scheme of the Online Safety Media Regulation Bill earlier this year. <\/p>  <p>   The General Scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will be progressed by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and contains provisions empowering the proposed Online Safety Commissioner to make online safety codes; assess the compliance of online services with those safety codes; direct online services to make changes to their systems; processes and policies and design and seek to apply financial sanctions to services who fail to comply.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Programme for Government commits to introducing, within 12 months, legislation to address those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic, and to revise and update the Incitement to Hatred Act and I can assure Deputies that my Department is working to prepare this legislation on hate crime and hate speech as a priority. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this work the results of a comprehensive public consultation and of a comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation will be published shortly. This will input into the formulation of proposals to strengthen our legislation and ensure it is evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting important rights to freedom of expression and association.  There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion and I intend to bring a General Scheme to Government for approval early in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO03300"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[40935\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120300079#WRO03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider reversing a deportation order on a person (details supplied).","asker":"1519","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>The person concerned has instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 10 October 2020.

The plan is framed to account for periods which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.<\/p><p>Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services.

It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s medium-term Strategy <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19<\/i>, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19, in a range of areas, over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.<\/p><p>The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.<\/p><p>The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.  Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. <\/p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The numbers of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Plan are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A-Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.9) Regulations 2020, (S.I.
