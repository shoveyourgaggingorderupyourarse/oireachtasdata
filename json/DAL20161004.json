Civilians are not being killed accidentally because of a conflict - they are being deliberately and repeatedly targeted.  This death and destruction is no accident.  It is the primary strategy of the Syrian Government and the Russian military.  Women and children hiding in the basements of buildings in which there are no combatants are being repeatedly hit with specialist bunker-busting missiles.  Hospitals are being hit with barrel bombs over a series of days until they are forced to close.  Civilians, particularly children, have no access to basic medical care, food or even water.  What we are witnessing is a systematic policy of trying to kill or drive out of the country every person who does not support the murderous Assad regime.  This is a potential genocide and it is escalating by the day.  We have already seen millions displaced by Assad's determination to maintain his murderous regime and retain the support of Russia, which has been critical to saving him.  Areas supporting moderate and democratic forces have repeatedly been their focus.  The reason that there is an international emergency concerning Syrian refugees is directly and unequivocally due to the actions of these governments.<\/p>  <p>  The question for Ireland is whether we will stand up for the people of Aleppo and the rest of Syria in the face of these war crimes.  Will we say to Russia in particular that the barbarism that it is directly facilitating is unacceptable?  Unfortunately, the overwhelming bulk of the groups here that describe themselves as anti-war are silent on Aleppo.  As they cannot attack the United States or the West for these actions, they prefer to say nothing.  In the case of Sinn F&eacute;in, it has engaged in incredible contortions to avoid any direct criticism of Russia and its President.  Has the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade summoned the Russian ambassador or discussed the summoning of same to convey our views and raised the matter at European Union level with a request for common action?  What is the EU doing in response to this barbarous, murderous activity sponsored by the Syrian and Russian Governments?  Is it going to stand by or will there be action in terms of our relationship with Russia?<\/p><p>The D&aacute;il should be unequivocal, as part of our Parliament, in condemning the genocidal attack on Aleppo.  We should arrange for a common agreed statement to do so.  More important, has the Taoiseach considered the need to significantly increase humanitarian aid in Syria?  I know there have been increases to date but this would help those who are in refugee camps filled with people fleeing the Syrian government and Russian bombing.  This winter could see an escalating catastrophe unless the international community dramatically increases its aid and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475586300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The answer to the first question is \"Yes\".  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Russian ambassador last Tuesday and left him in no uncertain terms as to how this country feels about the human catastrophe that is unfolding and has unfolded in Syria and particularly Aleppo.  The Minister made perfectly clear our absolute disgust at and abhorrence of the bombing of a United Nations humanitarian convoy going into Aleppo to relieve people who have had neither food nor water for quite some time.  There have been catastrophic deaths of men, women and children in particular, with the bombing of hospitals and the resulting break off of discussions between the United States and Russia on the matter.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade also spoke to UN High Representative Mogherini last Friday.<\/p>  <p>  The matter has been discussed at every European Council I have attended and the question is what kind of support can be given.  President Putin invaded Crimea and took it over a couple of years ago.  There has been destabilisation in a number of eastern Balkans states.  In this case, Russia and Iran have supported Assad and the United States and Europe have supported the opposition.  This is a human catastrophe and perhaps within the European Union we have always seemed to take peace too much for granted.  A few hours across the shores unfolds a misery from the deliberate destruction of human life across a range of fronts.<\/p>  <p>  There are sanctions against Russia and, separately from that, this country has increased its humanitarian aid on a number of occasions.  It is a sad fact that Syria has now been at war for the past five years and Aleppo is now becoming a symbol from a Russian perspective; with the success of the support given by the Russian forces to Assad, the intent is to obliterate Aleppo.  From the European Union perspective, Ministers have spoken directly to UN High Representative Mogherini.  I repeat that our Minister last Tuesday called in the Russian ambassador, leaving him in no uncertain position as to the way this country feels about the humanitarian catastrophe that has afflicted Syria for some time and Aleppo in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400004#B00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1475586300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  It is accepted that we all have enormous sympathy for the civilians in Syria and we all condemn the war.  Unfortunately, at this stage, that is not enough.  Has it been made clear to the Russian ambassador that normal diplomatic relations as we know them with Russia must come under the closest scrutiny if this genocide continues?  I do not say that lightly.  I am speaking about the country's diplomatic representation here and our bilateral relationship.  Something similar must happen with the European Union as it has gone down the line of appeasement.  We can consider the violation of Ukraine sovereignty and the creeping aggression of Russia over the past while.  Likewise, the strategy in Syria has been to render Europe and the United States essentially helpless bystanders as thousands of children, women and other innocent civilians are being murdered by all sorts of highly destructive weaponry such as bombs.  The pictures of young children being dragged from rubble represents an appalling indictment of the modern world.<\/p><p>It is appalling that a so-called major power can engage, without any sanctions, in Syria and essentially, in a genocidal way, obliterate the population.  Some of the choices facing Europe in the coming weeks and months may be unpalatable in terms of how we deal with this but deal with it we must if we are to have any moral compass in the context of how we conduct international relationships into the future.  Russia has gone too far on this occasion, by any yardstick, in terms of international geopolitics.  It is completely unacceptable and the D&aacute;il should unite in condemnation of what is going on in Aleppo today - not last month, two months ago or six months ago but today.

He invaded Crimea and took it over, although there has not been a word about that since.  There has been destabilisation in eastern Ukraine and pressure on a number of other states in that region.  In fact, at the European Union meeting in Bratislava two weeks ago, concern was expressed about the lack of a European Union policy on the eastern Balkan states in the context of the pressure and influence they are coming under from Russia.  Clearly, Russia is looking for ports on the Syrian coast.  There are many indicators to suggest that President Putin intends to restore, for want of a better word, the reputation and influence of Russia in the Middle East.  Syria was its last hold.  Russia's support, along with that of Iran, for the Assad regime has resulted in this humanitarian catastrophe.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade spoke to Mr. Ban Ki-moon in New York recently at the UN.  The latter has condemned unreservedly the recent attack on the humanitarian convoy and the death of aid workers.  I also spoke to the US Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, last weekend.  As Deputy Martin knows, the United States has broken off discussions with Russia because the latter has not lived up to the agreement the two countries had.  Maybe that is what Russia wants in order that Aleppo comes more into focus to be completely obliterated.  The Deputy is right about the cluster bombs and bunker bombs that are now being used.<\/p>  <p>  This matter was discussed at the European Council but we are not going to have a European army.  Some countries want to send in more assistance.  Other countries, like ourselves, are neutral and will remain so but are clearly concerned about the humanitarian issues for the women, men and children of Syria.  It is a very complicated geopolitical process but I assure the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, made it perfectly clear to the Russian ambassador just how strongly this country feels about what is happening before our eyes in Aleppo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400005#C00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1475586600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Last weekend the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, confirmed that she would trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty before the end of March 2017, thus triggering Brexit.  By insisting that Britain pursues a hard Brexit and leaves the Single Market, she has set the British Government on a collision course with the EU in which Ireland, North and South, is regarded as collateral damage.  It is very clear that the Tories do not regard Ireland as important in their shenanigans, or Scotland for that matter.  This means that the common travel area, the nature of the Border, movement of people, the nature of cross-Border and bilateral trade, not to mention the Good Friday Agreement, are now up in the air.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been very flat-footed on all of these issues.

This task could be undertaken as part of the all-Ireland dialogue he has proposed, particularly in the absence of any formal negotiations until next year.  That means much more than a one-day event on 2 November next.  There is a chance here to set the agenda, domestically and internationally, before any negotiations between Britain and the EU take place.  The sooner representatives of all the key interest groups get around a table to inform and devise a negotiation strategy, the better.  Does the Taoiseach agree with yesterday's statement on the issue of Brexit by the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, that none of this is a done deal?  It is vital that the Taoiseach leads from the front.  Will he inform us of the contents of the memorandum he brought to the Cabinet?

For that reason, the first all-island conversation on this matter will be held in Dublin on 2 November next.  That will be the first of a number of meetings.  All political parties that wish to attend will be invited.  We need to deal with representatives of sectoral areas, such as business groups, employers, trade unions, voluntary non-governmental organisations North and South, organisations like the British Irish Chamber of Commerce that participate in the current EU-UK stakeholder group, the Institute of International and European Affairs, European Movement Ireland, local authorities in Border regions, key Government agencies with a North-South dimension to their work, academic institutions North and South like the Centre for Cross-Border Studies, the Royal Irish Academy and the universities and higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept Deputy McDonald's suggestion that the Government has been flat-footed, as she called it, in this regard.  It was the one institution that actually had a contingency plan in place before 23 June, when the British people made their decision.  It is appropriate and important for Deputy McDonald to know that I happened to be in a position to visit the newly appointed Prime Minister very shortly after her accession to that office.  I congratulated her on her election.  Prime Minister May made it perfectly and publicly clear that she did not want to see and did not envisage a return to a hard Border.

More worryingly, there is no evidence of any plan whatsoever.  The Taoiseach accepts that the people in the North voted to remain.  That is the first reality to which we need to anchor all of this.  The Taoiseach accepts that the North has a special place and status for many reasons, not least among which is the peace process.  That is the second anchor.  The Taoiseach accepts, I presume, that for workers, business, agriculture, students and people wishing to access public services, Brexit has the potential to turn everything topsy-turvy.

As the economy continues to grow and recover, it is clear that the demand for income recovery will continue to increase.<\/p><p>It is the view of my party that solutions must be found to properly address these justified expectations, solutions that are more nuanced than either stonewalling all the requests and demands made by every trade union or, as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would have it, simply writing a cheque.  <\/p> <p> Outside the public sector, it is clear we need additional mechanisms to cope with quite complex disputes.

We are facing now into a winter of discontent on the industrial relations front.  This Government could do with all the advice and help it can get in this area.  The old employer labour conference predates social partnership.  It is not designed to supplant but to complement the work of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court.

The Taoiseach's strategy to isolate the ASTI is unravelling.  Importantly, his strategy seemed aimed at putting manners on all workers to try to stop the contagion spreading not just through the public sector, but also through the private sector, particularly when we consider the lousy 10 cent on the hour recommendation from the Low Pay Commission towards the minimum wage.  How, in the name of God, could an economy that is in recovery make that kind of offer to 20% of our population who work for that sort of pay?

They will find the Minister to be attentive to their particular problems and I hope that matter can proceed arising from those discussions.<\/p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, the Low Pay Commission was set up with a particular purpose in mind: to be objective, to be independent and to declare to the Government what in its view would be an appropriate increase for low-paid employees in respect of the minimum wage.  That is the reason it was set up, and after its establishment, the Government followed suit in implementing the recommendation of the commission.  The people concerned are not under the diktat of the Government, as the Deputy seems to point out.  In so far as the position in health is concerned, with a budget that now is greater than &euro;14.5 billion, the Health Service Executive, HSE, offers permanent contracts to young nurses coming out of college and permanent employment to nurses who have been in temporary employment.  Moreover, discussions are ongoing in respect of the incremental rights of those nurses who have been graduates for a number of years and who did not receive those rights.  The Minister for Health already has spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I hope this matter also can be resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400010#H00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1475588100,"counter":33,"content":"<p>To take up the Taoiseach's second point in respect of the Low Pay Commission, that a group of people who were objective and independent came up with an increase of 10 cent per hour, it would be interesting to ascertain for a start how much the members of that commission are getting paid hourly.  It does not make them objective or independent if they are getting a hell of a lot more money, which I suspect they are.  Second, the Government simply will not be able to recruit the nurses.  For as long as the FEMPI legislation remains in place and the Government does not deal with nurses' pay, beds that are needed in hospitals will not be opened up.<\/p>  <p>  I argue there are measures that could be taken which could repeal the FEMPI legislation at a cost of &euro;2.1 billion to the State.  First, the tax loopholes to entities such as real estate investment trusts, REITs, vulture funds and other financial institutions could be closed off.  The sort of tax breaks and loopholes they are allowed could be taken away.  Second, when one thinks about it, were workers to regain that pay, they probably would be paying back more than half of it in tax and PRSI to the State and would spend the other half.  It would not be hived off into tax havens and offshore accounts.  Workers actually spend in the economy and, consequently, there would be a net gain to all in terms of morale, recruitment, fulfilling the services of this State and returning the money to where it belongs.  The Taoiseach should stop protecting the very wealthy and give it back to workers who deserve it in abundance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400010#H00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1475588100,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I repeat for the Deputy that the Low Pay Commission is comprised of people who are not being dictated to by the Government stating what they must do.

Today, the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, is in Cork meeting PDFORRA, the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, and will address this matter somewhat further.<\/p> <p> There are no plans to withdraw Lariam from the range of anti-malaria medications available to the Defence Forces.  The use of and the information on these medicines are kept under review all the time.  It is just one of a number of anti-malaria medications used by the Defence Forces.  The choice of which medication to use is a medical decision.  When a person is sensitive to Lariam, they are generally not deployed for service in sub-Saharan Africa.  However, if for operational reasons an individual who has a specific skill set which might be fundamental to a mission&rsquo;s success but who had previously demonstrated sensitivity to Lariam or had a difficulty with its use, then one of the alternative medicines would be used.  If during the course of deployment an individual developed sensitivity to Lariam, they would be advised to cease taking the medication and provided with a substitute.  That individual would be monitored and, if their case was serious enough, repatriation might be necessary.  Obviously, there are several cases being taken.  They are medically screened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400013#L01500","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475590200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>The legislative programme published by the Government lists the judicial council Bill for priority in this session.

It seems that the Taoiseach is determined to go ahead with this charade.  The word on the street is that it is a delaying tactic, a Craggy Island solution to a problem.  It flies in the face of polls.  The Taoiseach always eschews polls, yet the Government is using a polling company to pick 99 people.  All of the other polls that have been done involved more than 99 people.  The last Amnesty poll showed that 87% of people wanted an increased availability of abortion under a range of circumstances and 38% of people expressed themselves as being fully pro-choice.  To another question in the Amnesty poll - I will be interested in the Taoiseach's response to this point - 68% of people stated that we should trust women when they say that they need an abortion.  That is what this is about.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach join me in showing solidarity with the tens of thousands of people who struck and protested in Poland yesterday against a similar law to the eighth amendment that attempted to ban abortion in Poland completely?  The Catholic church and its representatives in the Polish Parliament are behind this.  There will be an outcry against it in Poland.  One of the luxuries that the Taoiseach has, and one of the reasons that he has been able to sweep this issue under the carpet in his 41 years here, is that our country does not have backstreet abortions.  Instead, we have the luxury of England being just one hour away.  However, we do have abortion.<\/p><p>Three women per day carry out abortions in their own bedrooms.  How do we know this?  We know because the website <i>www.womenonweb.org<\/i>tells us three Irish women contact it every day to access abortion pills online.  Approximately 1,000 abortions take place illegally in this State.  The real question is whether we are going to keep them illegal or allow them to become legal.<br\/><br\/>I have three questions on the citizens' assembly.  The Taoiseach has outlined two meetings that will take place but will he give a clear timeline for the citizens' assembly?  When will it report to a committee and this House with recommendations?  The second question relates to witnesses and there is much concern about this among various groups.  What will be the composition of this expert group of witnesses?  For example, it is vital they not all be lawyers or constitutional experts.  They must include experts in women's health, obviously, but there should be independent witnesses as well as those who have views and an input into this.  For example, will the United Nations be asked to give testimony on this issue, as it has given its views on it?  Will representatives of the World Health Organization be present?  Will women's organisations, pro-choice groups and others with a strong view also be asked to participate?  What D&aacute;il committee will the recommendations go back to?  Will the Taoiseach set up a special new D&aacute;il committee or will it be referred to a health committee?  Where will it go before coming to the floor of the D&aacute;il?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400017#P02600","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475591700,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Coppinger for her question.  It is not for us to interfere in any other jurisdiction's legislation.  Abortion is illegal in this country and remains so except in very specific and particular circumstances that were legislated for under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act a number of years ago.  With regard to the timeline that was mentioned, the assembly has 12 months to do its duty.  The first item it will deal with is a reflection on and consideration of the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  I expect the chairperson, an eminent Supreme Court judge, will work with the assembly in setting out the timeline that is considered appropriate.  My view is that the assembly will report on the eighth amendment before the first half of 2017 and then move to the other items.<\/p>  <p>  Will it be possible for outside witnesses to give evidence?  Of course it will.  The proceedings will be streamed live and there will be the opportunity for people in Northern Ireland or any other jurisdiction who are unable to travel or who wish to make a submission to do so.  It is possible for them to do that.  The expert panel will be appointed by the chairperson, and that will apply in respect of each item being considered by the assembly, including the eighth amendment.  The role of the panel is to provide the assembly with impartial information.  Ms Justice Laffoy will make those appointments for the different elements that will be considered.<\/p>  <p>  I would expect that Ms Justice Laffoy would consider very carefully the skills, experience and nature of the character of the people she appoints.  She would obviously consider the Deputy's point about whether to appoint all academics, professionals or whatever.  This is about people throughout the country and reflective of the assembly itself, taking in gender, age, region and so on.  We have put in place arrangements for the establishment and continued operation of the assembly and selected a venue for the post-October meetings.  Once it gets down to considering its business, there will be considerable interest in the discussions taking place there.<\/p>  <p>  This will come back to a committee of the Oireachtas and we will consider how best that committee should function, the same way as we did with the Oireachtas committee, chaired by the former Deputy Buttimer, which considered the implications of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400018#Q00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1475591700,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I have indications from Deputies Martin, McDonald and Burton and there are six minutes left.

I submitted a question on the same subject of the referendum.  I will add to the Taoiseach's pain with a pile of other questions.  I am wondering about the selection process of 99 citizens.  Any reputable polling company would never conduct a selection of 100 people.  It would rather have 1,000 people as it is much more representative of the population.  I want the Taoiseach to tease out further how this was done.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach give us the name of the polling company?  Is the Taoiseach saying the polling company chose the 99 people in a stratified way or was it done randomly?  In other words, did it go through a scientific research process involving social class, age, religion, gender and even a history of crisis pregnancies, which is a criterion for anybody making a judgment on the future of women with crisis pregnancies in this country?  Has the said polling company, whatever it is, collected data on attitudes on religion, sexuality or reproductive rights?  The country should know its history and background.<\/p>  <p>  If the Taoiseach is telling us this will report before the first half of 2017, which I assume is some time before June 2017, we are looking at up to nine months for it to come back with a recommendation on whether to have a referendum on repealing the eighth amendment.  I assume that is what will be done and either we will have a referendum or we will not.  We are not getting it any other way.  Does the Taoiseach realise that by June 2017, another 3,246 women will have been exported from this country for a health procedure that they are not entitled to here?  That is a lot of women.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the march of more than 30,000 mainly young people and it was a much more representative cross-section of society and of where we should be going with the issue.

It is proceeding and I wish it well in its work.  It is only when we get to the detail of what people are proposing that we can have an honest debate.  With simple repeal, existing legislation would stay in place, which is hardly the option that will emerge.  The last time there was a consultation led by an Oireachtas committee on this subject, it was successful in the core task of at least defining everybody's positions and the exact measures required to enact each position.  There is nothing worse that just having a forum that provides new debating opportunities.  We need clarity on what will happen after the assembly.

I am troubled by two prospects.  First, the delay involved in this group of 99 citizens deliberating and then us going through all the machinations of the Oireachtas.  I am also a bit taken aback that the Taoiseach cannot tell us which committee the deliberations might go too.  My bigger concern, however, is that there can be no question of a referendum on the eighth amendment.  There has to be a referendum in respect of this provision.  People can have their own views on it but I am troubled at the prospect that 99 citizens and an Oireachtas committee might be used to frustrate the clear desire for and the absolute democratic necessity of a referendum on this matter.

This outreach remains critical in the run up to the next phase.<\/p>  <p>  During the negotiations which will commence when the UK has formally triggered article 50, it will be essential that our partners and the institutions have a detailed understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities.  In this regard, I welcome the statement provided by Prime Minister May at the weekend that the UK will trigger article 50 by next March at the latest.  Our efforts will redouble now that we have some degree of clarity about the British Government's intentions.  It is important that the process now moves forward in the most practical and sensible manner.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of my engagement with EU partners, at every opportunity I make it a priority to emphasise and explain Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns about Northern Ireland, Border and citizenship issues, the common travel area and the inter-connectedness of our economies.  We had an extensive discussion on the implications of the referendum result at the June European Council in Brussels.  As I relayed to this House afterwards, I took the opportunity during that exchange to outline Ireland&rsquo;s long and complex history with the UK, the uniquely close social, political and economic ties between these two islands and the profound implications for Ireland of a UK departure from the EU.  Since June, I have held bilateral meetings with Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, Prime Minister May and the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk.  I also met with the other 26 EU leaders earlier this month at a summit in Bratislava.  During all of these exchanges, I have ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns have been highlighted and explained in detail.<\/p>  <p>  My efforts have been complemented by those of my colleagues.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has spoken to every one of his 27 EU counterparts since the referendum, while other Ministers and senior officials have also been active in outlining Ireland&rsquo;s case in contacts at EU level and beyond.  In parallel, extensive analysis, planning and contingency work is progressing across all Government Departments.  This is supported by administrative changes, including within my Department.  A new division, led by a second Secretary General is bringing elements of the former EU, international and British-Irish\/Northern Ireland divisions together to provide strategic oversight on particular issues.  This includes an obvious emphasis on Brexit and support for the newly-established Cabinet committee on Brexit which I chair.  Staff from the former EU division are being transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as part of the strengthening of that Department&rsquo;s role and capacity on EU matters including those related to the Brexit negotiations.  Engagement with Ireland&rsquo;s embassy network abroad will also be important and already at embassy level some new posts have been established to focus exclusively on Brexit work.<\/p>  <p>  Across Government, staffing and resources remain under review and will continue to be calibrated to respond to particular needs as this complex phase progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400019#R03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1475592900,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  Unfortunately, the indications from the Conservatives point to a hard Brexit.  Are we going to witness Britain making the same old mistakes again in Northern Ireland by ignoring the democratic decision made by the people there in the recent referendum?  If so, the people of England will be enforcing their will on Northern Ireland again.  There is real concern along the Border, which is the area I am most familiar with, and in Northern Ireland with regard to what is going to happen.  Prime Minister May's offer of a consultative voice in the Article 50 negotiations falls far short of the democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  If this trend continues, the Government will immediately need to show the heads of the EU - the President of the Council, the President of the Commission and the other 26 Heads of Government - forcefully and clearly that Britain's approach will unfortunately have a wide and negative impact on this island and on relationships between North and South and between east and west.  It would not simply be about Britain exiting the EU.  It would vandalise the layered complexities of the Irish political process.  It would also damage the totality of relationships about which we have often spoken in this House and to which many communiqu&eacute;s issued by successive Heads of Government in Britain and in Ireland have referred.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously raised with the Taoiseach the obstacles that may be encountered when products leave this island and transit Britain on their way to destinations in the rest of Europe or in other continents.  Surely difficulties will arise when cargo leaves our island and hence the EU, goes through a non-member state - the UK - and tries to re-enter the EU again.  I remind the House that we do not have ferry services to the north of Europe.  This morning, I met a group of people from Fermanagh who have been involved in political life over many decades.  They are very concerned about the messages they are getting from Britain regarding the complete and serious difficulties that will be faced by the entire island if these issues are not dealt with successfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400020#S00100","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1475592900,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with Deputy Smith's comments.  When I met the Prime Minister in Downing Street, she said clearly that the British Government did not favour a return to a hard Border.  She does not favour a return to a hard Border and neither do we.  We will argue these fundamentally important matters forcefully and clearly, as suggested by the Deputy.  The Secretary of State, Mr. Brokenshire, told the Conservative Party conference today that there is no intention of having a return to a hard Border.  These clear statements need to be backed up.<\/p>  <p>  It has been decided that while the European Commission, which has always dealt with applications to join the EU and in which the expertise is lodged, will be centrally involved in the negotiations on Britain's withdrawal from the EU, the European Council - the Heads of Government and Heads of State - will make the ultimate decisions here as the elected leaders of member states.  These decisions will have the greatest impact on people in the various member states, including Ireland.  Obviously, in light of what is at stake here, we will have a facility for knowing about every step of the discussions as they take place.  The European Council will make those decisions.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment, a lorryload of machinery can leave Clare and go to Dublin or Rosslare before travelling through Britain and on to the EU's border with Ukraine without anything other than invoices being needed.  It is clear that if and when Britain leaves the EU and becomes a completely independent sovereign country, having implemented legislation that removes any EU jurisdiction on it, paperwork or a different kind of approval might well be needed if Irish cargo is to be able to travel through Britain.  This would cost time and money and would have obvious implications for jobs.  That is why the common travel area, which the British and Irish Governments want to retain, is so important for us here.  It is in that context that we will have to see what issues Britain is talking about and will present.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have enough time during this Question Time to deal with many of the implications of this long and complicated subject, as raised by Deputy Smith.  We will have ample opportunity to discuss it in the House in the future.  I will also have opportunities to brief party leaders about what is going on.  I would like to think that by November, when we get to the North-South Ministerial Council, we will have a much clearer fix on where the horizon is and what we need to do in respect of Northern Ireland, the cross-Border links and the economic trade.  We have been talking to Enterprise Ireland about the hundreds of thousands of small businesses here that are being affected by the sterling currency fluctuations, which are causing concern.

In the months since the Brexit referendum, I do not think the Government has kept the promise it made in our discussions at that time to keep pro-EU parties - all parties are allegedly pro-EU at this stage - informed of developments and to consult them on strategy.  We had one major meeting in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, but very little has happened since then.  It is clear from this morning's story and from the Taoiseach's reply to these questions that everybody wants the island of Ireland to be treated as a special case in the absence of UK membership of the Single Market.  That is not news.  It is about as blindingly obvious as anything could be.<\/p>  <p>  All of this shows how little concrete progress has been made in defining our position into a set of concrete negotiating priorities.  We have been told nothing about what we might ask for on the specific issues of how we want this island to be treated, the legal mechanisms that might be considered and the implications for the EU as a whole.  How do we ensure that people, goods and services can continue to flow on this island?  It is easy to say that is what we want.  That is all I am hearing from the British and Irish Governments and from everybody else.  How do we ensure the west-east common travel area is protected?  What ideas are we coming up with in that respect?<\/p>  <p>  We have seen a great deal of bluster from the British Government, but very little substance.  Despite what Mr. Brokenshire and the Prime Minister have said, they have come up with very little detail.  A tug of war seems to be going on in the Tory Party between the hard Brexiteers and those who want a soft exit.  Two groups have been formed within the Conservative Party.  Those involved in the \"Leave Means Leave\" campaign, which has substantial financial backing, want to revert to a World Trade Organization-type arrangement, as opposed to retaining access to the full Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  It is very easy to say we do not want borders on this island, or that we want everything to be the same in some magical way.  Obviously, there is work to be done on the actual detail.  Precious little progress has been made in going beyond the generalities and knuckling down to consider the specific route we will travel to ensure we ask for the right things for the island of Ireland and for the east-west travel area.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has outlined the roles of the Commission and the Council.  It was said at the outset that Ireland believed in the primacy of the Council and the member states in the negotiations.  I think President Juncker has continued his ill-starred approach to this issue to date.  He is talking tough, but he is ignoring the seriousness of the issue.  I think President Tusk has been far more measured and far more engaged.<\/p>  <p>  We were originally going to meet to discuss the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.

These cover issues like shared education, children and young people, shared spaces and services and building relations at a local level.  The INTERREG programme deals with research and innovation, environment, sustainable transport and health.  Many of these projects are supported by the European Regional Development Fund.  We need to know the situation regarding these moneys.  If and when Britain leaves the European Union, Northern Ireland will not be a member of the European Union.  The funds were allocated between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland for important uses.  When it becomes clear what it is that we are talking about, we then decide how best to negotiate in terms of the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned when I hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer state that they are in for a turbulent period economically in Britain.  We can see the evidence of this already in agri-sector employment in Ireland.  Currency fluctuations, over which we have no control, have an impact on exports, prices and employment.  These are issues we will have to raise with the European Union, of which we will continue to be a member.  While we do not have control over the currency situation, exports from Britain to here have an advantage in the sense of cost, while our exports to the UK are at a disadvantage.  The agri-sector, as you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is very important for the 200,000 jobs across the entire spectrum in Ireland, and the corollary applies in England.<\/p>  <p>  To be honest, until we see the colour of the issues that are going to count, we are preparing as best we can.  We will keep Members briefed, but it is too early to be sufficiently detailed to make political decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400021#T00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1475593500,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I am obliged to move on to Question No. 7.

This was his first visit to Ireland in his current role, although he had visited before when he was Prime Minister of Poland.  His visit to Dublin took place in the context of the Bratislava summit on 16 September and his intention to meet or speak to all Heads of State and Government in advance of that.<\/p>  <p>  Our meeting in Dublin allowed us to exchange views about the main challenges and priorities of the European Union and where the focus of discussions at the Bratislava summit and beyond should be.  We discussed the range of serious challenges facing the Union, including those relating to migration, economic stability and growth, security and Brexit.  We agreed that the Bratislava summit should be part of the process of political reflection launched in June to look at the future of the EU and what we can do to improve the lives of our citizens in a real way.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledged the concerns of many of our EU partners regarding migration, terrorism and security.  Of course I also highlighted the priority that Ireland and many other EU partners attach to economic issues, including investment, employment, the Single Market and the digital single market.  I said that we should consider concrete measures in the areas which would directly and positively affect the lives of EU citizens.  More generally, I assured President Tusk of Ireland's continued assistance and support in building a comprehensive response to the different and complex issues we face.  I emphasised the need for a balanced approach as the process of reflection about the future of Europe continues.  Further meetings are scheduled to take place in Malta in early spring and in Rome in March.<\/p>  <p>  Although the meeting with President Tusk was not about the UK decision to leave the EU, we reaffirmed the agreed principles that there can be no negotiations before the UK triggers Article 50 and that access to the Single Market requires acceptance of all four freedoms.  I gave him a brief account of my July meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Ms May, in Downing Street and took the opportunity to reiterate Ireland's specific concerns on this issue, particularly regarding Northern Ireland and the related Border and citizenship issues, the common travel area and the interconnectedness of our economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400021#T01000","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1475593500,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I will comment on what I see as the stunning lack of self-reflection and self-criticism from Donald Tusk and, for that matter, from the Taoiseach.  Donald Tusk said in his speech here that people are turning against what they perceive as an irrational openness and that they see the world around them getting more chaotic with uncontrolled migration and terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  First, these are unfortunate concessions to the scaremongering of those in the far right who are trying to whip up fear and racism against immigrants coming into this country.  They were not helpful words from Donald Tusk in that regard.  Moreover, they show a complete lack of self-criticism in the sense of asking about Europe's role in creating the sense of disillusionment that is widespread throughout Europe.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the meeting with Taoiseach, I note that Donald Tusk declined to comment on Apple.  It not a fact that the economic inequality throughout Europe is substantially a result of the fact that giant corporations evade tax or do not want to pay tax, the banks get it all their own way and people take it in the neck?  Is that not why we have such widespread alienation?  Is that not the seedbed for much of the racist sentiment that is then, wrongly, directed at immigrants?<\/p>  <p>  I note the conversation with Deputy Martin earlier about Aleppo and so on and the absolutely justified criticisms of Russia's disgusting actions in Aleppo, its bombing there and so on.  That criticism is right and proper.  However, something is absolutely missing when they are talking about the Syrian crisis and the migration crisis.  This much is clear from the comments of the Taoiseach, those of Deputy Martin or those from anyone in the European Union.  What is missing is any sense of the culpability of Europe and the West in the very same cynical military intervention, intervention in Syria and in the wider region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400021#T01100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1475593500,"counter":212,"content":"<p>That is outrageous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400021#T01200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1475593500,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Where is the criticism of Britain bombing Syria 43 times in the past six months?

It is clear that performance in rankings are often highly reliant on surveys of opinion and of citations in journals which do not adequately capture the full range of activities taking place in our third level institutions.  Nonetheless, they are widely read and can be influential.<\/p>  <p>  I want a strong higher education system that serves the needs of all students, enterprise and other stakeholders through high-quality teaching and learning, upskilling and reskilling, research and innovation, as well as supporting the most disadvantaged to participate in higher education as part of the overall goal of delivering the best education and training system in Europe by 2026.  It is important that we choose the goals and objectives and then benchmark ourselves against best international practice.

In many cases, employers are looking to hire highly specialised graduates with postgraduate degrees, whether it be master's or doctorates.  Apart from the societal and personal good that postgraduate study does, it is essential for our economic future to give as many people as possible the opportunity to pursue postgraduate studies.

In 2015-16, NEPS undertook such case work, including assessment, with 7,974 pupils in primary and post-primary schools.  In addition, 1,673 assessments were provided to schools through a panel of private practitioners.  Furthermore, NEPS psychologists in the period consulted teachers in respect of an estimated 25,000 pupils, providing advice as to appropriate interventions in solving issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the programme for Government commits to the expansion of NEPS psychologist numbers by 65 individuals, which constitutes a 25% increase.

However, I am aware of many frustrated principals, teachers and parents nationwide.

For example, the number of assessments has declined since 2008, from a total of 10,585 assessments to 9,824.  This represents an average of just two assessments or referrals per school per year and that simply is not good enough.  Children are slipping through the cracks and teachers, parents and schools are trying to fund-raise to help parents pay for psychological assessments.  That is not good enough because children need these assessments.  They need the recommendations offered by the assessments to secure resources in secondary schools.  In particular, children with dyslexia need such an assessment, which is vital to secure spelling waivers or other accommodations when sitting State examinations.

That is why NEPS works through a model that is not all about assessments, as I described in my answer to the question.  There is a new model approach to resource teaching that would reduce the reliance on assessments.  One problem with assessments, as I believe the Deputy indicated in her question, is there can be unequal access to them, and if they become the gateway, we might not be using the resources in the best way.

We have a great GP service, but I am concerned about the amount of pressure on the county's current GPs.  It will only worsen as the county's population grows and older GPs move towards retirement.<\/p>  <p>  Someone who wants to become a GP studies medicine for six years, does a one-year internship and spends four years in the training programme for dedicated GPs, which entails two years in a hospital and two in practice.<\/p>  <p>  There is no clearly defined area for Kildare at present.  This creates a problem for retention levels.  The latest Medical Council workforce intelligence report shows that County Kildare has only 41 GPs per 100,000 population.  This is the fifth lowest ratio in the country and is well below the national and international averages, the national average being 51 per 100,000.  Up to 25% of Kildare GPs are predicted to retire in the coming decade.  This is concerning and, if they are not replaced and even more recruited, it has implications for patients, practices and an already overstretched out-of-hours service.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State will be aware, Kildare has one of the fastest growing population centres in the country, with an increase of 5.6% according to the 2016 census, the third largest growth nationally after Fingal and Meath.  That percentage represents an extra 11,800 people living in Kildare since 2011.  It is estimated that every 2,500 in population growth in the county creates the need for a new GP, which means that almost five new GPs are now needed in addition to our 2011 numbers.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for a partnership Government emphasised the need to focus on enhancing primary health care services, including by building up GP capacity and increasing the number of therapists and other health professionals in primary care.  In order to do this while also investing in primary care centres, we must ensure that we can attract and retain more young doctors to work as GPs.  Specifically, I want to ensure that Kildare has a sufficient supply.  We are lucky to have 20 GP trainers operating in the county.  They are spread across a variety of schemes - midlands, midlands-Naas, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, TCD and UCD.  It is this spread that is the crux of the issue.  While these programmes get all of the benefits of the Kildare GP community and the KDOC out-of-hours service, Kildare itself does not retain enough graduates to meet future demand.<\/p>  <p>  Internationally, it has been shown that the presence of a local and identifiable GP training programme is an effective way of doing this.  County Donegal is a good example.  One would imagine that, due to geographics, it would be harder for that area to retain GPs after training than it would be for somewhere like County Kildare, yet Donegal exceeds the national average of GPs per population because it has its own identifiable training scheme.<\/p>  <p>  During recent presentations on the future of health care, Professor Susan Smith stated that one of the solutions to the issue of GP retention was providing targeted GP training in areas where GPs were needed.  I would like to see a GP training programme in County Kildare to help retain GPs.  The necessary skills and infrastructure are already in place, so this measure should not have a significant additional cost.  I understand that a reorganisation of GP training has been proposed for 2018 when the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, will take over from the HSE.  This is an opportunity for Kildare to have our own training programme.  We would welcome the Minister of State's support in this regard.  The programme would have the support of the majority of Kildare GPs and GP trainers and would be of significant benefit to Naas General Hospital, as trainees would spend two years on hospital placement.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline the pressure that our GP services are under.  KDOC deals with 60,000 clients per year.  This phenomenal figure shows the level of work involved, but we will need to be able to increase our numbers in light of our growing population.  The age profile of GPs is heading in the wrong direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400031#DD01000","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1475599500,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Heydon for raising this important issue.  I commend him on his work and interest in GP training in particular and on his views on and support for developing our GP services and, more generally, the national health service.  I assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring that patients across Ireland continue to have access to GP services, especially in remote rural areas and disadvantaged or socially deprived ones.<\/p><p>Several efforts have been undertaken in recent years to ensure that general practice remains an attractive and rewarding career option and to attract more GPs into the workforce.  These include: changes to the entry provisions to the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme to accommodate flexible-shared GMS-GP contracts and the extension of the retirement age for GPs under the GMS scheme to 72 years; an increase in the annual number of GP training places; and the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  In addition, proposals are being developed to introduce supports for GPs working in areas of social deprivation as part of the GP contracts review process.  A mapping exercise is under way and will inform the setting of eligibility criteria and the actual content of the support framework.  The GP contracts review process will, <i>inter alia<\/i>, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice an attractive, fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.<\/p><p>GPs are essential to the provision of accessible services to patients in the most appropriate setting.  Increasing demands on the health system will have a major impact on the future need for GPs.  The HSE's national doctors training and planning unit is working on developing detailed workforce plans for different medical specialties.  Its report, Future Demand for General Practitioners 2015-2025, found that there was an under-supply of GPs.  I accept Deputy Heydon's point in that regard.  Medical workforce planning for general practice has, therefore, been prioritised in this context.<\/p><p>The HSE and the ICGP announced this year that they had reached general agreement on the future delivery of the national programme of specialist GP training by the latter.  \fThis is an important change in the way that GP training is delivered and funded and will ensure that we build more training capacity while maintaining the high quality of training required of our GPs.<\/p><p> The annual GP trainee intake was increased from 157 to 172 this year.  This is an increase of 53 places on the number for 2010, when GP training places stood at only 119.  This further step is crucial to ensure the capacity is there for GPs and primary care to take on additional responsibilities, including greater GP care coverage and the management of chronic diseases within the community rather than in hospitals.  The programme for a partnership Government also recognises the need to build GP capacity and commits to increasing the number of GP training places over the next five years to 259 places annually.<\/p> <p>GP training programmes are delivered by 14 separate GP training programmes throughout the country and are not designed along county boundaries. County Kildare does not have its own dedicated GP training programme but there are several GP trainees based in GP trainer practices in County Kildare.  These trainees are principally aligned to the midlands and Trinity training programmes, with 14 in the midlands programme and four in the Trinity programme, a total of 18.  The Department will continue to work with the HSE and the Irish College of General Practitioners to ensure the general public can continue to have ready access to GP services and that doctors have access to GP training opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400031#DD01100","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475600100,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and, in particular, I welcome the increase in the number of training places that he mentioned, as well as the agreement between the HSE and the Irish College of General Practitioners announced earlier this year on the future delivery of the national programme of specialist GP training by the college.  That is a positive.  What I want to take from this debate is an acknowledgement that the demographics of Kildare, with such a young population that is due to age and which is consistently growing, will lead to greater demand on GP services into the future.  There is an ageing aspect in our current GP services and a problem in Kildare with retention of the trainees we are putting through the system.<\/p>  <p>  We have 20 trainer GPs throughout the county doing great work but we are not retaining enough of those they are training.  Any GP in Kildare wants to know that when he or she retires, somebody else will take his or her place and care for patients at the consistent level shown heretofore.  A rural area such as Castledermot reaches from the Wicklow border over to Athy.  In places such Athy town, Newbridge, Kilcullen and everywhere in between, patients are concerned about this matter.  With many families, the GP is the first port of call when anybody needs a service.  KDOC is doing a fantastic job out of hours and, as I said, there were 60,000 clients last year.  It is phenomenal and one of the most successful out-of-hours services in the country.  With GP services, now is the time for us to plan adequately for the future.

This is a response to a HIQA report and St. John of God services being non-compliant with two living conditions elements.  Apparently, the St. John of God service position is that there should be consultation and agreement with the HSE to set up a national task force to progress decongregation, with St. Mary of the Angels as a national pilot site.  St. Fidelis is top priority and the plan was drawn up in agreement with the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  This has caused consternation with some of the residents and their families.

Throughout 2015 and 2016, the primary focus of St. John of God Kerry services has been on addressing the high risk areas of the HIQA action plan and in particular the issues relating to fire safety.  There was significant consultation with residents and their families while this work was undertaken as some residents were temporarily relocated while<\/p>  <p>  On 18 September 2016, a family forum meeting took place at which the HIQA inspections and de-congregation were discussed again.  Concerns were raised and many family members were worried that their relative would not be suitable for community living.  It was agreed that a family representative group would be set up and a meeting with the senior management of St. John of God Kerry services would be scheduled.  In total, 78 people currently residing on the Beaufort campus will ultimately be supported over a number of years to move to more suitable accommodation in the community, depending on available funding and on sourcing suitable houses in the community.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I announced that we are providing &euro;100 million in capital funding from now until 2021 to ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings and into their own homes in the community.  I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.  I want to assure any concerned residents or family members that the process of moving a person with disabilities out of a congregated setting is not something that happens overnight.  This process of moving people to more suitable accommodation in the community will take place over a number of years and will be done in full consultation with all residents and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400033#FF00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1475600700,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and do not doubt his sincerity concerning the residents of St. Mary of the Angels.<\/p>  <p>  Effectively concern centres on two units, namely St. Fidela's and St. Brendan's.

I had a meeting in my office about 20 minutes ago with representatives from St. Michael's House.

I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the calls for the October deadline for slurry spreading to be extended.  The severe weather we have experienced in recent months has severely curtailed spreading activity.  Next week's 15 October deadline needs to be extended.  Farmland across the country has had little time to recover from the severe downpours during the summer.  Many farms are still waterlogged and large areas of land have simply become unworkable.  The current slurry spreading deadline is too tight.  Farmers are severely limited in their ability to do the required spreading.  Each year, we face a similar scenario and the deadline must be extended.  Extending it is the only sensible thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  While I appreciate that the nitrates directive is in effect, I call on the Minister to talk with his European counterparts to secure some flexibility for farmers whose lands have been severely damaged as a result of recent weather conditions.  Farmers need to be reassured that the Government is doing everything in its power to extend this deadline.  The weather defines all options for spreading slurry for tillage farmers in various parts of the country with crop losses and for farmers who have been unable to conserve sufficient fodder for the winter period.  In some parts of the country, livestock had to be housed for the better part of the summer and opportunities to spread slurry were limited by poor ground conditions.  This has left many farmers with full tanks as they face next week's deadline.<\/p>  <p>  The abnormal levels of rainfall that have been experienced in most parts of Ireland in recent months have made farming exceptionally difficult.  Under the nitrates directive, the spreading of chemical fertilisers, livestock manure, soiled water or organic fertilisers is prohibited when the land is waterlogged, when the land is flooded or is likely to flood, and when heavy rain is forecast within 48 hours.  Farmers must check the forecasts from Met &Eacute;ireann.  In light of these regulations, allowances need to be made in cases where farmers have not had adequate time to spread slurry given the poor conditions.  Farmers have faced increased difficulties with getting machinery onto land.  The weather has also affected silage and arable crop harvesting and the emptying of slurry tanks.  There have been exceptional challenges in some counties as a result of high rainfall.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that farmers in Northern Ireland have been given an exemption to spread slurry past next week's deadline, as long as they can provide a reasonable explanation for such an extension.\u00a0 I urge the Minister to argue for a similar exemption for farmers here.  The Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Michelle McIlveen, MLA, understands all of these difficulties, including the increased costs associated with worsening land conditions and the need to house animals earlier than usual.  The recent bad weather had devastated tillage farmers' crops in some counties.  Fianna F&aacute;il has called for an emergency fund to be created to cater for farmers who have seen their farmland destroyed.  A fodder scheme is needed to support farmers who have lost hay, silage and straw.  I urge the Minister to take a reasoned approach to this issue and to accommodate farmers who are trying to cope with dire conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400034#GG00300","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1475601300,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to outline the position in respect of the spreading periods for organic fertilisers.  I thank Deputy Scanlon for raising the matter and for giving me the opportunity to bring some clarity to it.<\/p>  <p>  The nitrates directive and Ireland's nitrates action programme are given legal effect by the consolidated European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2014, as amended.  The objective of the regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.  Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of organic fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and ground waters.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the requirements of the nitrates directive, the regulations mandate closed periods when the application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited.  In addition, the regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen or waterlogged or when heavy rain is forecast.  Specified closed periods are a key feature of the directive in all member states.  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive public consultation and discussions with farming bodies and the European Commission.  Recent data from the agricultural catchments programme, which is operated by Teagasc, support the current closed periods in Ireland.  A key message from the research is that there are disproportionately high nutrient losses to waters during the winter.  The current closed period coincides with the time during which risks of incidental nutrient losses to water are at their highest.<\/p>  <p>  The expert review group that was established to manage the review of the nitrates action programme in 2013 considered whether the current closed periods were sufficient.  The group was of the opinion that any change in or relaxation of the closed periods would need to be supported by science.  This view was also strongly expressed by the European Commission.  Having considered all the information available to it, the group concluded that no scientific evidence had been provided to it to support increased flexibility in light of the risks from spreading at this time of the year.  The expert review group also agreed that the shoulder periods on either side of the opening and closing dates should be considered risky times for nutrient losses to water.  As a precautionary measure, the group recommended that the stipulated setback distance from surface waters should be doubled from 5 m to 10 m for two weeks before the commencement of the closed period and two weeks after the conclusion of the closed period.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of negotiations with the Commission, the current third nitrates action programme clarified that soiled farmyard water, depending on the level of dry matter content, does not need to be treated as slurry.  This is of benefit to dairy farmers in addressing slurry storage capacity issues.  In order to prevent an elevated risk of pollution to water bodies and the danger of the contamination of drinking water supplies, the Minister has no plans at this time to consider an extension to the period for spreading slurry in 2016.  However, he will keep the matter under review.  I hope my reply has been of some assistance to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400034#GG00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1475601300,"counter":379,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has given me a very disappointing answer.

In fairness to farmers, they should be told about such issues when they make their applications and not three, four or five months later when payments are due to be made.  There can be further delays of five, six or seven months in such circumstances.  This is the only income that many farmers have.

The agreement was to restore recognition of the incremental credit for the 36-week clinical placement to all graduates since 2011, when it was stopped.  However, as the Minister is aware, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform chose to amend this agreement to sanction recognition only for those currently on placement and future graduates.  As a result, nurses who graduated between 2011 and 2015 will now be earning less than their colleagues who graduated before 2011 and the new 2016 graduates.<\/p>  <p>  In reply to parliamentary questions on the matter tabled by me last week, the Minister stated that the question of extending the recognition to these nurses may be reviewed on foot of consideration of whether the sanction granted would result in an increase in recruitment and retention rates of training nurses in 2016 and 2017.  How on earth does the Minister intend to measure this?  The fact is that for the majority of recent graduates, full-time positions are simply not on offer.  Consequently, the Minister's strategy cannot accurately gauge the effectiveness of this measure to retain nurses in Ireland.  Why is such a study necessary given that in the business case set out by the HSE and the Department of Health in favour of the 2015 agreement, it was acknowledged that restoration of the increment would aid in retention of graduate nurses, a problem the HSE was trying to grapple with at the time.  This finding was further supported by a recent survey conducted by the Union of Students in Ireland.  The survey suggested that the withdrawal of the incremental credit was a factor not only for those who had remained in Ireland and are now deciding to leave, but also for those who have left when it comes to deciding whether to stay abroad or come back home.<\/p>  <p>  In recent briefings to Deputies, representatives from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland and SIPTU nursing unions raised the real prospect of a scenario whereby unless we take action now, we may not be able to ensure that the winter initiative beds will actually be opened and, moreover, that we will face spiralling overtime and agency costs.  Given that we are currently spending in excess of &euro;22 million on agency staff, should every effort not been made to retain the staff we currently have, and, thereby, demonstrate the value of their contribution to the health service?  On the most basic level, this is where these measures falter.  Nurses serve on the front line of our health service.  Without their dedication and commitment to patients, our health system would simply cease to function.  How can we expect them to believe they are valued when faced with such evident inequality in their treatment?  The HSE has no issue with this.  The Department of Health has no issue with this.  Why is the Minister blocking this agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400035#HH00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1475601900,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this matter, which I know to be of interest to many within the House.<\/p>  <p>  The issue, as the Deputy described, relates to the campaign by the INMO and other nursing unions, including the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland and SIPTU nursing unions, aimed at restoring incremental credit for the 36-week clinical placement undertaken in the fourth and final year of their degree programme in respect of former nursing trainees serving in the period 2011-15.  The background to this matter is that incremental credit for the 36-week clinical placement undertaken by fourth year student nurses was abolished by the then Government in December 2010 as part of a range of measures aimed at reducing the public service wage bill.<\/p>  <p>  Following consideration of a submission made on behalf of the nursing representative bodies, including INMO, PNAI and SIPTU nursing, as well as the Department of Health and the HSE, my predecessor sanctioned recognition of the 36-week placement as qualifying for incremental credit for students on a placement in 2016 and in future on 19 February this year.  The sanction stated that the question of awarding incremental credit for the placement to nurses who graduated between 2011 and 2015 may be reviewed on foot of consideration of whether the sanction granted in respect of 2016 and future graduates resulted in an increase in the retention rates for these graduate nurses.  Nurses who undertook the placement in 2016 have recently completed their placements and are only now in the process of becoming registered.  Therefore, the extent to which the restoration of the credit will result in an increase in the retention rate of graduate nurses will not become evident in the immediate term.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this matter, it is the case that officials from my Department and the Department of Health met recently to discuss whether there was scope to accelerate this review process for the restoration of incremental credit to 2011-15 nurses.  Furthermore, the Minister for Health has now written to me in on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Many initiatives are currently under way to improve nursing staff levels throughout the country.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to the 2016 degree programme graduates and is offering full-time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE launched an international staff nurse recruitment campaign focused on attracting nurses back from the UK to jobs in Ireland last year.  There was a particular emphasis on targeting Irish nurses who had left Ireland in recent years and who are keen to return home.  The campaign offered them a relocation package of &euro;1,500, nursing registration costs with NMBI and funded postgraduate education.  There has now been an increase of 1,163 nurses employed in the public health service, from over 34,000 to a little over 35,500 in the two years to August 2016, numbers having fallen by 4,000 in the previous seven years.<\/p>  <p>  The question of whether there is scope to accelerate the review process for the restoration of incremental credit to 2011-15 graduates is currently being reviewed by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion at the earliest time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400035#HH00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1475601900,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that reply but there are several points that the Minister seems to be ignoring.  Can the Minister stand over a situation whereby people doing the same job are not being paid the same amount?  That is what it amounts to for graduates who came out between 2011 and 2015.  People who graduated before that get the incremental credit, but people who graduated this year do not.  How can the Minister justify an arbitrary decision to single out particular graduates by virtue of the year they graduated and suggest that they are worth less than their colleagues who graduated in other years?<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister accept that the campaign run last year by the HSE to try to attract back graduates was not very successful?  Graduate nurses who have found work elsewhere, who are being paid decent wages and who are living in countries where the cost of living is not as high as here will continue in their current roles if they continue to be discriminated against, as in the case of recent graduates here.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has said he will review the situation on the basis of recruitment in 2016 and 2017.  Again, that is completely unfair to these people.  Why should they have to wait to see the result of the outcome of the review post 2017?  The Minister for Health could tell the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform very clearly that the biggest issue facing the health service at the moment is the difficulty in staff recruitment and retention.<\/p><p>There are many reasons for that.  Pay is one, cost of living is another and lack of respect and a sense that people are not being adequately valued is certainly another.  People can only feel that sense is reinforced by the Minister's failure to honour the agreement the nursing unions have reached with the Minister for Health, the Department of Health and the HSE.  The Minister is welching on an agreement already reached between the nursing unions and his Cabinet colleague, and that is unacceptable.

Part 1 sets out the Title of the Bill and all Parts will be commenced on enactment.<\/p><p>Part 2 amends the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995 to allow for the payment of fees to members of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, formerly the Irish Medicines Board, as such fees are payable to the members of other boards.  Currently, under section 8(7) of the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995, as amended, only the chairman of the authority is entitled to a fee.  There is an onerous responsibility and a significant time commitment placed on members of the authority, and we wish to attract the highest calibre of people to apply to be members of such boards.  Some people may be self-employed, and without the fee that will be paid under this amendment, it would be very difficult for them to give the time commitment involved.  There is no additional cost to the Exchequer relating to paying board members of the authority, as it is mainly self-funding.  The fee approved for payment to each board member, in keeping with the guidelines issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is &euro;7,695 per annum.  The additional cost to the authority will be up to approximately &euro;61,560 per annum.  However, some members may choose to waive their fee and the one person one salary principle will also apply to members who are in receipt of a salary from the public service.<\/p><p>Part 3 aims to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, otherwise known as the fair deal scheme, to exclude certain <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments which have been or will be made to people under specific schemes approved by Government for the purpose of assessment of means under fair deal.  This is a very important amendment.  Several groups within the State have been in receipt of, or will receive, <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments as a result of Government decisions which acknowledge the hardship, pain and suffering which the people affected underwent.  The schemes being covered in this legislation are the Lourdes Hospital Redress Board, involving 119 women; the Lourdes Hospital payment scheme, which compensated women who were excluded from the redress board on age grounds alone, involving 47 women; the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme, which has made awards to around 400 women; and payments made either by the Government or by the German Contergan Foundation to 32 Irish survivors of thalidomide.<\/p><p>The Bill will also amend section 36 of the 2009 Act, giving regulation-making power to the Minister to allow for an exemption for other similar groups that may receive <i>ex gratia <\/i>payments from being taken into consideration for support under fair deal, provided such schemes have been approved by Government.  This is the way that such exemptions under various social welfare schemes are managed also by the Department of Social Protection.  The key principle underlying this legislation is that a person should not be disadvantaged because of acceptance of a payment under an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme which has been approved by Government.  Fair deal applications are means tested and the people themselves or their partners could be over the income threshold for availing of fair deal supports because of receipt of their <i>ex gratia<\/i>awards.  The proposal will not give access to free nursing home care to the various groups, but it will mean that the payments they receive under Government-approved <i>ex gratia<\/i>schemes will be not be considered as part of their income for the purpose of assessment under fair deal.<\/p><p>Part 4 amends the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, Part 1 of Schedule 3.  This amendment is required to ensure over-the-counter products which do not require a prescription can continue to be available under the General Medical Service, GMS, and community drug schemes if so required.  This will ensure over-the-counter medicinal products, including emergency contraception and nicotine replacement products, can continue to be reimbursed to medical card holders after May 2018.  The amendment proposed will allow the HSE not to apply the criterion regarding prescription-only medicines when considered appropriate in the interests of patient safety or public health.<\/p><p>Another amendment proposed is to paragraph 1(<i>e<\/i>) of Part 1 of Schedule 3 of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which currently specifies that medicinal products must have a marketing authorisation referred to in paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) of the definition of &quot;authorisation holder&quot; in section 2(1) of the Act.  The reference to paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) is unintentionally restrictive as it excludes products which are authorised by the European Medicines Agency and parallel imports.  Parallel importation is the importation from a European Union, EU, member state or a country within the European Economic Area, EEA, of a medicinal product, which is essentially similar to a product already authorised in Ireland, by an importer who is someone other than the importer appointed by the marketing authorisation holder of the product on the Irish market.  The parallel trade of medicinal products is based on the principle of the free movement of goods within the Internal Market of the EU, Articles 28 to 30 of the EC treaty.  It was never the intention to exclude such products and any such inference would be contrary to free trade principles.<\/p><p>The explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill notes that, &quot;Allowing reimbursement of certain over-the-counter medicines under the GMS and community drug schemes will give rise to some additional cost from loss of prescription charges over time, but this is not expected to be significant.&quot;  However, this is not correct.  My officials have now confirmed that there are in fact no additional costs arising from the amendments proposed in Part 4.  My Department will ensure this is clarified in any further briefing on the draft legislation.<\/p><p>Part 5 seeks to amend sections 2, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015.  Section 2 of the Act sets out the definitions used in the Act, section 7 deals with retail packaging of cigarettes, section 9 with roll your own tobacco products, other tobacco products including cigars are dealt with in section 10, presentation of tobacco products in section 13 and features of retail packaging in section 14.  The regulation of the appearance of tobacco packaging is intended to contribute to improving public health by reducing the appeal of tobacco products to consumers, increasing the effectiveness of health warnings on retail packaging and reducing the ability of the packaging of tobacco products to mislead consumers about the harmful effects of smoking.  This country has led the way through successive Governments in respect of tobacco control and moving towards a tobacco-free Ireland.<\/p><p> The Act currently provides for a number of elements to be prescribed by the Minister, including the colour of the outer and inner surfaces of tobacco packaging, the form and manner of barcodes and the manner in which a name may be printed on tobacco products.  The amendments to the 2015 Act put forward in this Bill are to provide, by way of regulations, for a number of other matters relating to the appearance of tobacco packaging.  Some of these matters are of a technical and practical nature, and some seek to provide basic information to the consumer.  These amendments will permit the following elements to be included on tobacco retail packaging: text to indicate the type and weight or number of tobacco products contained in the packet; the inclusion of a tab to allow consumers to reseal the package; the inclusion of a calibration mark, which may be necessary for the automated production of the packaging; the contact details of the manufacturer; and additional information on cigar bands.<\/p> <p> This Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill serves to make important changes to four Acts in the interests of equity or, in some cases, patient safety, and of course the tobacco legislation is to help protect public health.  I look forward to the passage of the Bill so that we can get on with making the improvements regarding the fair deal scheme, which is being led by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and the job of introducing the standardised packaging for tobacco being led by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, which is the next important step in terms of our move towards a tobacco-free Ireland.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.  I hope Members on all sides can agree to support the legislation and have it passed as quickly as possible by the Oireachtas so that we can get on with making these important improvements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400036#JJ01000","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475603100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I am also delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on Second Stage of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was published in January.<\/p><p>As Minister of State for mental health and older people, I am particularly pleased about the provisions in sections 6 to 8, inclusive, in Part 3 of the Bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  As the Minister, Deputy Harris, pointed out, this is a critically important provision for many of our senior citizens as it will exempt payments made to persons under the <i>ex gratia<\/i>schemes approved by Government from being included in the assessment for support under the nursing home support scheme.  This provision applies to persons who have received awards under four schemes, namely, the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme, payments to the 32 Irish survivors of thalidomide, the Lourdes Hospital Redress Board and the Lourdes Hospital payment scheme.  I am particularly pleased that the Bill provides for the Minister to make regulations to allow for this exemption for other similar groups that may in future receive <i>ex gratia<\/i>awards where the Government has approved the schemes.<\/p><p>Any individual who has received an <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment under the Government approved scheme has experienced much pain and suffering in their lives.  It is an extremely important principle that these same people, on reaching a more senior stage in their lives, should not be in any way disadvantaged financially when it comes to making an application under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act or the fair deal scheme, as it is more widely known.  The nursing homes support scheme<i><\/i>is an important scheme that provides financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing is accessible and affordable to everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The cost of the standard components of residential care is covered by the scheme, including all appropriate nursing and personal care, and any basic aids and appliances that are required by residents.  It is an extremely important scheme, therefore, for many older people.  To put it in context, at the end of August 2016, the scheme was supporting in excess of 23,000 older citizens in nursing home care.  The net budget for the scheme this year is &euro;940 million<b>, <\/b>which represents an increase of &euro;43.1 million on the 2015 outturn.<\/p><p>All applicants to the scheme must undergo a financial assessment which is carried out by the Health Service Executive, HSE.  That determines how much the participant in the scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  The scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment to ensure that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care and to ensure an applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his or her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State pension, whichever is greater.In addition, the Bill provides a statutory basis to exclude the <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment for the purposes of the HSE assessment of income for the nursing homes support scheme.<i><\/i>It should also be noted that a person's eligibility for other State schemes such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment card scheme are unaffected by participation in the nursing homes support scheme<i><\/i>or residence in a nursing home.<\/p><p>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is important legislation that includes key age-related provisions in respect of persons who have received <i>ex gratia<\/i>awards and who now in their older years are seeking supports under the nursing homes support scheme.  The Bill also proposes valuable changes to a total of four Acts to ensure equity in the case of older persons, and in the case of tobacco, drugs and medicines, to help protect public health.  I hope the Deputies will support this important Bill and I look forward to the debate.<\/p><p>I endorse what my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, said and I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400037#KK00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1475603100,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill which makes necessary changes in a number of important areas of health provision.  The Bill was originally published last January, and the delay in bringing it before the House is somewhat unfortunate.  Nonetheless, the Bill is to be welcomed.  While the Bill is described mostly as being technical in nature, it addresses a number of key issues affecting very vulnerable people in our society, and in that respect it is to be very much welcomed.<\/p><p>I will address a number of key aspects of the Bill.  Part 4 amends the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  I would point out that last May, Deputy Kelleher introduced a Bill to amend the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 in a number of ways.  The Minister recommended that it would allow prescribers, consultants and doctors to use biosimilar drugs or other biologics instead of existing medicines, with the aim of reducing the cost of drugs supply, which, as we all know, is a bone of contention.<b><\/b>The second Part of the Bill would allow prescribers to prescribe newly diagnosed patients with generic, more affordable medicines instead of branded products.  The House would welcome an update in terms of the Minister's view of that area.<\/p><p>I wish to raise the issue of Orkambi.  The Minister will be aware that cystic fibrosis, CF, is a genetically inherited disease that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system.  Ireland has the highest rate of CF in the world, with one in 19 of our people suspected of having the allele.  Last January, CF patients were dismayed by a ruling by the National Centre for Pharmaeconomics, NCPE, which recommended that this groundbreaking drug, Orkambi, would not be made available or funded by the Government.  I seek clarification on the stage the Government is at in its negotiations with the supplier, Vertex, to ensure the supply of this desperately needed drug.  The NCPE gave it a positive health impact assessment and recognised that Orkambi would have substantial benefits for people who suffer from CF and alleviate their suffering.  It seems to be solely a pricing issue.  CF patients are particularly distressed by what they see as the current stonewalling by the Department of Health in giving them information on the stage of the negotiations, or even if they are ongoing.  The lack of <sup><\/sup>consultation both by the Department of Health and the HSE is unacceptable.  In fairness, the Minister should not have to accept these outrageous prices.  In terms of ethics, Vertex and other similar companies should address the issue of the prices they are seeking.  Unfortunately, we have seen a trend develop throughout the world recently of companies buying drugs that are coming off patent and jacking up the prices.  We have seen that happen with regard to the EpiPen and a number of other drugs.  Orkambi is a new drug that has a real effect.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to explain the steps the Department has taken to challenge the unjustified prices and outline whether he has raised this issue at EU Council, EPSCO, level because the pricing of Orkambi seems to be an issue in a number of countries across the EU.  I believe Germany has licensed it but there is an issue with the update because of the costs.  France, the United Kingdom and other countries have an issue with the pricing also.  While these issues are ongoing, and the Minister has to get a fairer deal, it is a travesty that this drug is not available for CF sufferers.  Any significant delay is affecting these people.  I understand the Minister's difficulties, but he must show CF sufferers the steps he is taking to address these issues, get a fairer price and, importantly, make this drug available for them as soon as possible.<\/p><p><b><\/b>The second issue I want to address is tobacco.  Tobacco companies invest huge sums of money in advertising and marketing their products to recruit new customers, who are nearly always children and young people.  That is the reason the 2015 Act to introduce plain or standardised packaging was so crucial.  Plain or standardised packaging limits the tobacco industry's ability to attract young people by using marketing techniques that are intentionally misleading.  Making tobacco products less attractive to consumers, making health warnings more prominent and reducing the ability of the packs people to mislead people, especially children, about the harmful effects of smoking, are critical steps to reducing the attractiveness of tobacco products.  The further amendments to the Act, which will help to enable that, are very welcome.  However, sections 7 to 14, inclusive, of the Act have still not been commenced.<\/p><p>They must be commenced as soon as possible to address the issues and to take away the ability of these tobacco companies to continue to market tobacco products to young people and new customers.  Fianna F&aacute;il seeks the commencement of this absolutely critical step as soon as possible and I urge the Minister to do this.  As the Minister noted earlier, Ireland has been a leading country in this area and we can take the lead once again.  On commencing this legislation, Ireland once again will become a leader in the implementation of Articles 11 and 13 of the World Health Organization, WHO, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  However, as we will not be in that position until the Act is commenced, I ask the Minister to so do as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p> I thank the Acting Chairman.

Fianna F&aacute;il will support this Bill, which makes necessary changes in a number of areas.  I specifically wish to speak on the provision for the amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 to exclude certain <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments, which in the future will be made to individuals under specific schemes approved by the Government for the purpose of assessment of means under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  Part 3 of the Bill seeks to amend the aforementioned Act.  The nursing home support scheme, also known as the fair deal scheme, provides for financial support for people who need long-term nursing home care.  Those who use the scheme make a contribution towards the cost of their care and the State pays the balance.  The amount paid by each person is determined by a financial means assessment.  The 2009 Act has been amended in the past to exclude from financial means assessment <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments from the Magdalen laundry redress scheme and this Bill provides that <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments from other redress schemes will also be excluded from any assessment, which Fianna F&aacute;il supports.<\/p><p>However, I am disappointed that while there have been media reports about family farms being treated differently under the fair deal scheme in the future, there is no mention of it in this Bill.  As matters stand at present, if the owner of a family farm must enter a nursing home and is still the owner of that family farm or has only transferred it within the past five years, the entire value of that family farm is taken into account under the fair deal scheme calculations.  In the case of a principal family residence, the contribution is capped at 7.5% per annum for three years, that is, 22.5% in total, and I believe this should be done for family farms as well.  It is completely unfair and puts family farms at a serious disadvantage.  There must be recognition that a family farm is simply a means of providing a livelihood for that family and not having a cap on the value of that farm for the fair deal scheme is completely unfair.  While something may be done in this regard as part of next week's budget, it was remiss of the Government not to include such a provision in this Bill and Fianna F&aacute;il seeks its consideration in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400038#LL00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1475603700,"counter":402,"content":"<p>How much time do I have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400038#LL00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1475603700,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The Deputy has more than 12 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400038#LL00500","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1475603700,"counter":404,"content":"<p>First, as our senior spokesperson and Deputy Cahill have noted, Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill.  It contains some good measures with many more to come.  However, while the Ministers of State are present in the Chamber, I will use the opportunity to raise a number of other issues.  First, I wish to raise the issue of arthritis services for children in Ireland, which are in a bad state.  I gather there are precisely 2.5 whole-time equivalent rheumatologists in Ireland.  That is the second worst provision in the European Union.  Given the prevalence of the disease, there should be five to six rheumatologists for a population of our size.  Although the World Health Organization recommends waiting times for children of no more than six weeks, the current waiting time for a child in Ireland with arthritis is a staggering two years and four months.  Essential appointments for children are being cancelled regularly due to the consultant paediatric rheumatologist being called for on-call emergency treatments in Crumlin hospital.  On foot of the cancellation of these essential appointments, many children who are on what are highly dangerous drugs are not being viewed with the frequency required to give them the optimum care and treatment plan that is needed.  In essence, what is needed is an increase in the number of paediatricians and, in particular, an increase in the number of rheumatologists here in Ireland.  In addition, I note this service is only provided for in Dublin.  While Manorhamilton is a centre for arthritis and related matters in north County Leitrim, it is an adult-only service that children cannot attend.  What is required to avoid children being obliged to make long journeys or to have such long waits is to have a regional locum clinic for this condition visited by the appropriate paediatric rheumatologist.  As I noted, the WHO recommends six weeks whereas in Ireland, a poor service is being delivered at present with waiting times of two years and four months.  Clearly, children who are obliged to wait for so long while suffering from such an acute illness could be irreparably damaged.  As they are growing, they obviously need ongoing care of a specialist nature and children in Ireland are being failed at present.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of home help hours, which has become an issue in all Members' constituencies.  All Members are aware the cupboard is bare in terms of resources but it is about the management of what is being done.  Older person services are covered under the social care division, which in turn is a division within the community care area.  The Ministers of State opposite may be able to find out the name of the national lead in this regard but I understand, and anecdotal evidence certainly confirms, this individual is directing nationally that all help hours are to be reduced.  Moreover, the direction is not to go over a certain amount regardless of the level of needs or dependency.  I ask the Ministers of State to look into this on a national basis because this is what is coming back anecdotally from the social care professionals throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I refer to the many people who wish to be cared for in their own homes and who are surviving quite well there with the appropriate level of home help hours.  The reductions arising from the new directive that appears to be coming down from the aforementioned lead person in older person services, which is under the aegis of the lead person for social care, will mean these people will not be able to cope.  In turn, this will put more pressure on the nursing homes throughout the country and as Members are aware, there is a shortage of nursing home beds with an ageing population and in turn, that will put even more pressure on the acute services.  Moving on from that, the winter initiative in effect means that patients being discharged from hospitals are receiving priority over those who are already receiving home help in their homes.  This will put further pressures on that scheme and there should not be such a prioritisation at the expense of people who already are being cared for in the community.<\/p>  <p>  As I do not wish to be seen as merely moaning without at least suggesting some solutions, I will reiterate a suggestion I made as a Member of the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il earlier in this term.  Costings should be carried out on the partial abolition, at least, of the means test on the carer's allowance.  To my mind, everyone has a relative, be it a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle, a father, a mother or a grandmother, for whom a family member would be more than capable of caring in the home with the benefit of the carer's allowance.  This would enable that person to keep the relative in his or her home.  In addition, one could ensure the person was in receipt of a medical card.  To add further to this point, even if home adaptation grants were required for that purpose, it still would be a fraction of the cost when compared with the average weekly cost of a nursing home, which is between &euro;800 and &euro;1,600 per week depending on the part of the country and whether they are public or private, which is a colossal amount of money.  To go further, the cost of an acute bed per day is approximately &euro;1,000.  Consequently, these figures certainly justify carrying out a costing on this proposal and being prepared to push the boat out to ask whether there is a better way to keep people in their homes.  Clearly, that is where people would like to remain and if there are family members who are in a position to care and to do this, why do we not at least examine the potential to give such people the carer's allowance, as well as some additional supports?  To my mind, a cursory glance suggests the large amount of money that could be saved, not to mention the pressure that would be taken off what is a small number of nursing home beds.  Moreover, from listening to the spokesperson for the emergency medicine practitioners in Ireland, Mr. Fergal Hickey, all Members are aware of the difficulties being experienced in respect of bed numbers in acute hospitals.  He suggests, for example, that 300 people die every year because not enough beds are made available for people on the acute side and I ask the Ministers of State to take this on board as well.<\/p><p> My colleague mentioned the drug Orkambi.  I cannot stress enough the importance of making this drug available to patients throughout the country who are suitable for treatment.  Orkambi is a game-changer.  By changing the game, we can equally reduce the burden on the State in terms of caring for these patients when they become more ill because Orkambi is not available to them.  Young people have passed away in every constituency.  In my own constituency, in particular, the late and courageous Gr&aacute;inne Golden and her family, her sister Aisling and mother Terri, have been exemplary in promoting the need to make this available.  Former Senator John Crown and I brought forward a suggestion in the previous Seanad to the effect that rather than people being obliged to fight, through Joe Duffy's \"Liveline\" and other means, to get access to certain life-saving cancer treatments and drugs, it should be the case that the Government opts out of the provision of a drug if the cost per life saved is not justifiable.  We had the ipilimumab crisis in terms of skin cancer some years ago.  Orkambi is no different.  We can change the lives of these young people and their families.  As I said, if it is merely down to pounds, shillings and pence, we can also remove some of the burden on State because if people are not treated with this drug, they will become a greater burden down the line.<\/p> <p> All politics is local, as Tip O'Neill famously said.  I do not want to lose the opportunity to comment against the backdrop of a Minister of State perpetrating a charade whereby he sought to have an additional cardiac catheterisation laboratory facility put in place in Waterford where, from a clinical point of view, one is not needed.  There is an existing lab there and cardiac care is available.  In addition, there is also a motorway to Dublin.  There is good proximity to Cork, where there are many cardiologists.  The position in the north-west of the country is somewhat different.  Indeed, I must give the analogy of two maps I came across lately - one showed the road network in 1729 and the other was for the motorway network in 2016.  These maps which mirror each another.  Indeed, many of the acute health services are the same - north of a line between Dublin and Galway and west of Mullingar, or, for want of a better expression, the greater Dublin area, there are no cardiac catheterisation laboratory facilities.  If one has a heart attack in that part of the country, one has a lesser likelihood of survival than somebody in Dublin or, indeed, Waterford who suffers a heart attack.  Prior to the election, the Government announced that there would be a cardiac catheterisation laboratory in Sligo to serve the north-west region.  Deputy Tony McLoughlin can confirm this in the event anybody in the House has a short memory.  We are anxious to know when we will move to a position where tenders will take place and these services will be available so that the people in the north-west have the same possibility to survive as those equal citizens from other parts of the country.<\/p> <p> We have had an issue with follow-up mammography, in respect of what a pre-election promise was also made.  As the Minister will be aware, cancer services were stripped out of the north-west in what, quite frankly, was a shameful act by a previous Government.  In fact, my own party was in government at that time.  It was the wrong decision then and it remains equally wrong today.  Follow-up mammography for those ladies who require it was promised prior to the election and now it seems what we will have is a truck visiting for two weeks per annum to facilitate only those women who, thankfully, have been five years clear of cancer.  That is all that will come.<\/p> <p> In terms of other capital plans that also were announced, one which dates back to 2010 is a new 90-bed facility in Sligo University Hospital, formerly Sligo Regional Hospital.  I wonder how much the rebranding cost.  Perhaps that money could have been better placed in upgrading the facilities that have been promised by successive Governments over the years.  There is a 90-bed facility somewhere in the mix and I would very much like to see an update on that.  That hospital serves a population in the region of 280,000 and we are interested to know when precisely that will be up and running.<\/p> <p> I refer to a new 21-bed facility at the existing mental hospital.  Currently, there is a facility where, no matter what their complaints, people are all put together in wards.  In terms of its practice, it is almost medieval.  There is a 21-bed facility in the mix somewhere in the capital plan within the HSE but rumours abound that the priority of this Government is only the national children's hospital and that everything else will be placed on hold as a result.  We would like to get some clarification on that issue also.<\/p> <p> Finally, I ask in connection with waiting list times throughout the country.  I touched on the position regarding rheumatologists and, specifically, the need for more consultant rheumatologists to be appointed on the children's side.  In the context of psychology and psychiatry, the waiting times for children with issues are beyond a joke.  In some instances, the waiting period is a couple of years.  In others, it is many months.  This is simply far too long for people to be obliged to wait.  I appeal to the Minister.  While I appreciate that we are discussing the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which my party will be supporting, and rather than waste the time that was available, it was important to highlight some of the genuine needs of the north-west and, indeed, children throughout the country.  I would also ask that the Minister would reminisce upon and embrace some of the pre-election promises which the people of the north-west have waited far too long to see fulfilled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400038#LL00600","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475604300,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy MacSharry for that valuable contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400039#MM00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1475604300,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Obviously, I am here to discuss the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill but given that Deputy MacSharry raised the issue of home helps and home help hours, I would say for the record that, unlikely him, I do not accept that the cupboard is bare in terms of resources.  In fact, the cupboard is far from bare.  The problem lies with the officials who stand between those who need the services and the cupboard.  There are plenty of under-utilised and unused home help hours available in the system.  The difficulty stems from the Department of Health and the HSE not sanctioning those staff who are available and willing to work.  That said, I will talk about the matter in hand and hope that whoever else is sitting in the Chair exercises the same kind of latitude that I have just seen when I speak in the future.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of my party, I welcome the Bill.  It is important that the provisions specifically relating to plain packaging will finally be enacted following the passage of the Bill.  In the past year, since the successful passage of the plain packaging legislation through these Houses, we have missed a crucial deadline in respect of the circulation of plain packaged tobacco products.  This has rightly been a source of a lot of discontent to those organisations, such as the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and ASH Ireland, which have been campaigning hard on this issue for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  When the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015 was passed, there was a collective sigh of relief.  Ireland was to be one of the pioneering countries to introduce plain packaging.  We had stood up to the unscrupulous tobacco companies and their extensive lobbying efforts.  Public health trumped corporate interests.  It is regrettable that the 20 May 2016 deadline was missed.  Factors, such as the general election and the protracted negotiations relating to the formation of the Government, meant that this Bill did not come to the House soon enough.  In that regard, I, as the Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson, wish to see the smooth passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas so that we can finally ensure that plain packaging for tobacco products begins.  This is vital as the commencement of the provisions of the 2015 Act relating to standardised packaging will be deferred until the enactment of this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  What strikes me, and what is important when we talk about this particular provision, is that despite what the tobacco companies may crib and moan about, despite how many billions of euro they pump into public relations, advertising and lobbying worldwide in order to talk about profits, the industry and trade, they always neglect to mention that they are peddling death.  There is no other way of saying it - they are profiting directly from death, familial and community decimation and heartache.<\/p>  <p>  Profit, turnover or the needs of the industry do not lie at the heart of this Bill or the legislation passed last year.  I am not my party's spokesperson on jobs, enterprise and innovation; I am its spokesperson on health.  This is a public health issue.  It is an issue that, should we choose to ignore it, would result in a lose-lose situation for the public.  The public would lose out in terms of their own health outcomes as they risk capture by - on foot of heavy marketing, branding and the lure of the tobacco industry - and getting hooked on a deadly drug.  We must also consider the cost to the public health system from treating the diseases caused by that same drug.  Some people use the term \"nanny state\"; I call what we are doing being responsible legislators.  This is a matter of public health.<\/p><p>It is important that we give people all the information they need in order that they can see the effects of smoking and will be 100% in no doubt of how this drug affects them and those around them.<br\/><br\/>When preparing for this debate, I read the transcripts relating to the legislation passed last year.  In that context, I was struck by how far public health legislation has come in terms of restricting the advertising relating to and packaging of these deadly products.  Looking at some old advertisements from the United States, it is blatantly clear why we cannot trust nor expect tobacco companies to have any regard for public health.  If they had not been regulated, they would have continued to make such ludicrous claims for their products such as &quot;For your throat's sake&quot;, &quot;Scientifically proved far less irritating to the nose and throat&quot;, &quot;I protect my voice with Luckies&quot;, &quot;More doctors smoke Camels&quot;, &quot;Just what the doctor ordered&quot;, &quot;For digestion's sake&quot;, and &quot;To keep a slender figure&quot;.  They cannot be trusted with public health and that is why decisive legislation such as that before the House is badly needed.  When those same companies tried to challenge democratically elected governments which were looking out for the public interest of their citizens, we should not have been surprised.<br\/><br\/>I, like many others, was happy to discover that the European Court of Justice rejected a case brought by big cigarette companies, which has meant that the passage of this legislation is now the last hurdle to the practical introduction of plain packaging for tobacco products.  In a preliminary ruling last December, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice found that the standardisation of labelling and packaging is a proportionate measure.  As we all know, the EU tobacco products directive, which was adopted in 2014, had been held up by a series of court cases.  Earlier this year, this ruling was reaffirmed when the court said that such packaging requirements are &quot;such as to protect consumers against the risks associated with tobacco use and does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective pursued ... the EU legislature did not go beyond the limits of what is appropriate and necessary.&quot;  We should not run scared of these companies.  We should stand confident in the fact that the research available to us demonstrates that standardised plain packaging will have a positive impact on health and that it is a proportionate and justified measure.  Let us never forget that more than 5,000 Irish people die prematurely every year form the effects of smoking.<br\/><br\/>To return to the slogans used in the United States, think of the false and misleading nature of the health claims attached to them and the allure the companies employed.  These items of legislation permanently consign that to the annals of history.  Standardised packaging can reduce the appeal of tobacco products and increase the effectiveness of health warnings.  It reduces the ability of branded tobacco packaging to mislead people about the harmful effects of smoking.  When we consider that almost 80% of smokers start when they are children, these public health measures stop the normalisation of smoking before it starts.<br\/><br\/>When we speak of the legal threats of big tobacco companies and of the bully-boy tactics by these profit moguls who peddle their wares irrespective of the consequences or risks, it would be remiss of me not to mention one of the biggest threats to the success of this legislation, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  Countries across the globe have introduced legislation to protect citizens form the risks of smoking and to promote healthy lifestyles.  As in the case of Ireland, this has included plain packaging for cigarettes and tobacco products.  We have seen tobacco companies try to block such moves from becoming law.  We have witnessed the extent of their lobbying.  They tried to go even further with Philip Morris attempting to sue to government of Uruguay over anti-smoking legislation.  This was the first time a tobacco group challenged a state in front of an international court and the first investment arbitration concerning tobacco control.  Thankfully, it lost that case earlier this year.  This David-and-Goliath situation is iconic because it is indicative of the way that corporations can use international investment treaties to attack those regulations made in the public interest.  <br\/><br\/><i>The Guardian<\/i>newspaper earlier this year quoted Juan Fern&aacute;ndez-Armesto, a Spanish lawyer and expert on investment arbitrators who said:<\/p><blockquote>It never ceases to amaze me that sovereign states have agreed to investment arbitration at all ... Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review, without any restriction or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all decisions of the courts, and all laws and regulations emanating from parliament.<\/blockquote><p>The ability of tobacco companies to take this action with European governments may be made possible because of the international state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  This is why Sinn F&eacute;in opposes TTIP, which contains the ISDS.  TTIP is not just a free trade deal.  It will extend beyond the removal of tariffs to include the opening of markets on investment, services and public procurement and the removal of any so-called barriers to trade.  The stated aim of TTIP is to remove unnecessary barriers to trade through regulatory convergence.  However, these barriers are some of our most prized standards.  Changes to regulation can have negative impacts at great social cost.  We cannot have a situation where big tobacco companies can try to undermine the legislation and the public health concerns of individual countries because specific laws jeopardise their profit margins.  The health of citizens is more important than the wealth of tobacco companies.<br\/><br\/>It would be a slap in the face in the context of this legislation and all the work that was put in by the Oireachtas and the relevant non-governmental organisations, stakeholders and health professionals if TTIP were not opposed.  While I welcome the passage of the legislation and look forward to seeing plain packaging in operation, I worry that, should TTIP succeed and should the ISDS mechanism be introduced, all this hard work will have been in vain.  I invite the Minister to outline the Government's position on TTIP in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the part of the Bill that amends the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, I recognise the importance of ensuring that over-the-counter products continue to be available under the General Medical Services, GMS, and community drug schemes.  Public health is paramount.  Any measures we can take in the Legislature to ensure it remains paramount should be welcomed.<br\/><br\/>I wish to revert to comments I made, and to which the Minister responded, during a motion on pharmacy fees a week ago.  One of the amendments I tabled sought to look at how dispensing fees could possibly be reduced for patients.  In that regard, we recognised that the switching of medications from a prescription to a non-prescription basis could do this in some small way.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, oversees the reclassification of both prescription-only medicine to over the counter, OTC, in pharmacy status and from OTC to general retail sale.  In our Better4Health policy document launched late last year, we note that at that time the authority identified more than 30 products that could be reclassified.  These include topical antifungals, steroid creams and proton-pump inhibitors.  The Minister noted that this was an issue for the statutory agency and I understand that the HPRA actively seeks applications from suppliers and gives ongoing consideration to the relevant issues.  Following on from this debate, it would be interesting if the Minister could advise - perhaps not now but at some point in the future - how successful this call for applications has been, at what rate suppliers are seeking reclassification or why, perhaps, there is not a greater take up of this reclassification option.  Similarly, if these medicines were reclassified, would they continue to be available under the GMS and community drug schemes or would further amendments to the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 be required?<br\/><br\/>I do not wish to speak for too long but I would like to encourage the swift passage of this legislation so that we might finally see plain packaging for tobacco products become a reality.  This is a critical public health matter and, ultimately, I would like to see smoking eradicated completely.  In our pre-budget submission today, Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed an increase in excise duty of 50 cent on a packet of cigarettes.  This is on public health grounds, obviously, and is not intended to be a revenue-raising exercise, as I am sure the Ministers of State will appreciate.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on disability rights and older people, will use a later speaking slot to discuss the amendment to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.<br\/><br\/>While I have the attention of the two Ministers of State who are present, I would like to put on record that I was outraged to read media reports to the effect that a member of the Government will seek to oppose any measures designed to increase the cost of a packet of cigarettes.  I am a former smoker.  I understand it is incredibly difficult to give up smoking but I also understand it is incredibly important that we encourage people to do so in whatever way that we can.  I would like to hear a clear statement from either of the Ministers of State or any member of Government that would distance this Administration from those potentially dangerous remarks.  Remarks such as those that were reported in the media with regard to smoking do damage to any person who is considering giving up smoking.  It is against public health policy.  I would like to see members of this Government clearly distance themselves from those shameful and outrageous remarks.<\/p><p>It is not acceptable that a member of Government would seek to block an increase in the cost of a packet of cigarettes.  I am sure there are no members of Government - at least I hope not - who are unaware of the damage, danger and cost to our public health service of smoking and smoking-related diseases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400039#MM00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475605500,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Deputy Alan Kelly has 30 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400041#OO00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1475605500,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I will not use all of the 30 minutes.  I will break my contribution into three components.  The first is on the Bill, which I will go through in a small bit of detail.  I have two very capable Ministers of State in front of me, one of whom is leaving the Chamber.  I want to make a number of short pre-budget contributions.  I will raise a very serious issue which is not one I have raised before with the Minister.  It is on something very specific which I want to raise on the record of the House.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party will support the Bill but I am perturbed with regard to why it took so long to come before the House.  It was drafted and in place over six months ago while I was still in government.  It is not contentious; it is something the House will, by and large, support.  This is the \"Go slow\" D&aacute;il and the \"Whatever you do, do nothing\" D&aacute;il.  This is a Bill that could have been brought before the Houses before now.  Why was it not?  It should not have been delayed.<\/p>  <p>  There is no issue on the fees in the amendment to the Irish Medicines Board Act so long as everything is done within the regulations set out and normal caveats apply to things like double jobbing.  The amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act are long overdue.  Anomalies existed with regard to the different groups that received settlements down through the years and the amendment is necessary because of that.  It is long overdue, it is common sense and we very much support it.  On the amendment to the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and the over-the-counter medicines, we welcome that this change will be brought about.  It is necessary to update it to ensure that all of these are covered under the GMS scheme so that people will be protected and will have the medicine they require.<\/p>  <p>  I have very strong views on the issue of tobacco packaging.  Unlike the previous speaker, I have never smoked.  I absolutely despise the practice.  I have zero tolerance of it.  I am perturbed that it took so long to bring this forward.  I accept all the amendments; they are a necessity.  It is a pity the Minister of State with responsibility for public health is not still in the Chamber because this is an area in respect of which we need to up our game.  We need to up our game with regard to public health, smoking and young people.  The percentage of young people smoking is unacceptable.  We have a huge awareness campaign across a range of different areas.  Public health policy needs to improve dramatically in respect of this matter and we must use new mediums to connect with young people.  We have to intervene very quickly with them, show them it is not cool to smoke and that the health impacts over their lifetimes will be disastrous.  The number of young people one sees smoking is disheartening.  From a public health point of view, we will have the full support of the House.  The Minister will have everyone's support, although possibly not the support of one of the Ministers of State in the Department of Health, particularly in light of some of his recent comments.<\/p>  <p>  This an area in respect of which there is a need for an increase in funds.  We should ensure we are using every medium and social media in particular.  There should be a concentrated campaign in schools and colleges to ensure the effects of smoking on health are brought to their attention.  A discourse should be encouraged in Irish society to the effect that smoking is not an acceptable practice, that it has impacts beyond one's own health and that it affects other people's health.  It is something we need to improve on.  We need to be very honest.  Such a practice and such honesty from all Ministers of State in the Department of Health would be helpful in light of the recent comments by one Minister of State in this area.  I compliment the Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion on her honesty in how she is tackling some of the issues.  I hope all other Ministers of State in the Department of Health take up this practice, particularly in trying to ensure we limit the damage smoking is doing to our young people in particular and to everyone in society.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise a number of pre-budget issues.  We will be putting forward our budget proposals in the coming days.  I will get a great deal of time to speak on this matter on many different occasions, so I will not take up too much time doing so now.  I want to be very specific.  We have to completely change tack in the area of community interventions, home help hours and home-care packages.  Like a number of other Deputies who are present in the Chamber, I am a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  A submission was made by one of the hospital groups.  If one breaks that submission down, it was saying that in order to prevent the overcrowding in some of our hospitals, which is obviously a serious and critical issue, we need to redistribute the funding in the community sector and ensure that it is actually administered, real, and having results.  That will do more to prevent the overcrowding we see in our hospitals all the time.  Given the ongoing discussions, I implore the Minister of State to make provision for a dramatic increase in home help hours and home-care packages.  I also ask that in the administration and coverage of community intervention teams, we create a situation where they are consistent across the country.  We should not have a situation where, for example, they work certain hours in the south east, other hours in the south west and another group of hours in the mid west.  Some are working Monday to Friday and others are working Sunday to Sunday.  It is just crazy.  We need a consistent approach and one that is working all over the country.<\/p>  <p>  There is a necessity, from the point of view of the backlog, to invest serious funding in the area of dental health care for children.  I am nearly ten years at this and in my time in politics I have never seen backlogs such as those which exist now in terms of the provision of dental care for children and particularly for young teenagers.  The indications I am getting with regard to waiting times are absolutely scandalous.  It needs to be dealt with because it will create other costs down the road if it is not dealt with.  It means we are only pushing problems down the road which will cost us more so we might as well put in the intervention for these people as early as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue on which I wish to comment has nothing to do with the budget or the Bill.  It is something I have not raised before but it is very important.  I want the Minister of State to take some account of it.  I refer to the treatment abroad scheme.  This is a scheme whereby treatment that cannot be brought about in Ireland happens elsewhere, in many cases in Northern Ireland or Britain.  The costs are quite severe and the cases that are brought about in this area are unique.  In the past, this was managed through the HSE but part of the management of the costs has transferred to the Department of Social Protection in recent years.  Some of those who have to avail of this scheme are not being treated well and are falling between the two stools of the two Departments.  I would like the Minister of State to investigate this.  I have one example of a young boy who is four years of age.  I will not give his full name.  His first name is Billy and he loves tractors.  He suffers from transverse myelitis, which is a neurological disorder caused by an infection.  He is paralysed.  He had a home-care package at three years of age, with which I was able to help him.<\/p><p>He does not live in my constituency, if anyone thinks so, but actually in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy.  Although he received great treatment at Temple Street hospital and a fantastic reception from the Health Service Executive, HSE, with a home care package, Billy&rsquo;s condition in the rehabilitation centre could not be improved.  Subsequently, he had to go under the transfer abroad scheme to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the UK.  In fairness, under the scheme, Billy&rsquo;s associated costs are covered as well as flights for his mother.  Billy&rsquo;s condition is very rare and the quicker the intervention he gets, the more chance he has of making a recovery.  He will have to spend one week of every five weeks going to Stoke Mandeville.  The issue is that the one week he already has gone over to Stoke Mandeville has cost his family &euro;3,000.  If his treatment will take up to four years, this cost will not be sustainable for his family.<\/p> <p> I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me some latitude on this.  The family has asked me to highlight this case and has already made it public, so I am not stepping outside on this.  There is a precedent with the exceptional needs payment from the Department of Social Protection.  It is a unique case and there seems to be a gap between the HSE and the Department of Social Protection.  The community welfare officer has said they cannot do any more.  It needs a quick rethink to impact on the life of a beautiful young boy who has a great future in front of him.  I have visited him myself and he has a huge personality.  His family is looking for the State to match up and do its best for him too.<\/p> <p> I will pass on the personal details of the case to the Minister of State.  I hope she, along with the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, will examine this to find a solution for Billy and others who may be in this situation.  I do not believe what has occurred in this case is deliberate.  Simply put, since the transfer from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection, a gap has emerged in how it is being dealt with.  I would appreciate it if it could be looked into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400041#OO00300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475606100,"counter":413,"content":"<p>One aim of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is to amend the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 to allow the reimbursement of some over-the-counter medical products, including emergency contraception, to medical cardholders.  I, along with Members from the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit, AAA-PBP, will vote for this.  It is better that those on medical cards and those on low incomes can have access to emergency contraception rather than being forced to pay for it.  However, I draw attention to some of the problems with the current system in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Emergency contraception is more likely to be effective the sooner it is taken.  A woman who has need of emergency contraception and can afford to pay for it over the counter in a pharmacist is one matter.  What about the situation facing a woman who has to go to her general practitioner for a prescription for emergency contraception?  What happens if the GP is closed for the weekend, as is the norm?  It means the woman has to wait until such time as she can get a prescription.  The longer one waits, the less effective the emergency contraception is likely to be.  This discriminates against those on medical cards and low incomes who, because they are forced to wait, will have an increased chance of an unwanted pregnancy.<\/p>  <p>  How do we overcome this situation to get rid of this problem?  A simple way would be not to require a prescription for emergency contraception for a woman on a medical card.  A better way would be that emergency contraception should be available at pharmacists and free of charge.  This is a health priority for women faced with an emergency situation and who want to take steps to avoid an unwanted pregnancy.  It is not like this is not done in other countries.  One need look no further than the UK.  A woman in London, Birmingham or Glasgow who finds herself in such a situation can go to some pharmacies, a contraception clinic or most National Health Service walk-in centres to avail of emergency contraception free of charge.  If it can be done in the UK, why can it not be done here?  We believe it would be the right course of action.<\/p>  <p>  I draw attention also to another incredible fact.  In Ireland in 2016, a pharmacist is legally entitled to refuse to dispense emergency contraception on the grounds of conscientious objection.  Such a pharmacist is obliged by law to refer the woman to another pharmacist who will provide emergency contraception.  However, in practice in some rural areas, where there may not be a significant number of pharmacies, it can mean emergency contraception becomes extremely difficult to access or even inaccessible.  That is completely unacceptable.  This conscientious objection get-out clause should be scrapped.  This is the 21st century and this country has to stop facilitating those who would drag us back to the 19th century.  Women&rsquo;s health is too important for that.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the plain packaging for tobacco products, a measure I strongly support.  I would warn, however, against this progressive measure being trumped by new trade agreements.  For example, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, currently under negotiation between the European Union and the United States, would provide for the possibility of the establishment of investor-state dispute settlement courts.  These would be business courts which would allow big business interests to sue governments for hindering their attempts to maximise profits.  As such, these courts could regard the plain packaging for tobacco products measure as an illegal restriction on the right of tobacco companies to maximise profits and sell their products.  It has happened in other countries with similar settlement courts.  This measure is a progressive one that should be adopted.  Instead, the likes of the TTIP agreement should be scrapped, along with its investor-state dispute settlement courts.  They are courts for big business and are not in the interests of ordinary people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400042#PP00200","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1475606700,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see Deputy Clare Daly.

As I said, I certainly was not expecting to have to speak tonight.  The Bill has five Parts, each one amending a different aspect of existing health legislation.  I will deal with some of them separately and we will see how we get on.<\/p>  <p>  I will start by looking at Part 4, which amends the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The amendment to that Act will allow the HSE to include non-prescription medicines on the reimbursement list applicable to medical card and other drug schemes.  From that point of view, such a measure is to be welcomed.  However, this Bill limits the drugs that can be reimbursed to emergency contraception and nicotine replacement therapy drugs.  While it is great to see these two categories of drugs being reimbursed, there are a number of issues about how it is being done.<\/p>  <p>  As it currently stands, medicines must only be available by prescription in order for people with medical cards and long-term illness cards to be able to access them without charge.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 included a provision that medicines to be reimbursed must be available only on prescription with the reimbursement list to be reviewed every three years.  In essence, that meant that in June 2016, any drugs that came off the prescription list since the introduction of the Act had to be removed from the reimbursement list.  We saw that one of the morning-after pills was made available without prescription in February 2011 but another was reclassified as non-prescription in April 2015.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill aims to ensure the morning-after pill is reimbursed by the HSE but it falls far short of making emergency contraception easily available to women with medical cards or long-term illnesses.  In that sense, the manner in which it does is regrettable because this is a huge area in terms of women's reproductive health.  The morning-after pill should be easily available, accessible and free to those on medical cards.  What we have here is discrimination or two-tier access to reproductive health care products and drugs because women with medical cards or long-term illnesses will still need to go to a doctor to get a prescription for the morning-after pill.  The morning-after pill is freely available without prescription to women who are lucky enough to be able afford it and only involves a trip to the chemist.  It is ridiculous and utterly discriminatory that women who have a medical card or a long-term illness have to go to a doctor to get a prescription.  It goes against the very sound rationale that made these drugs available without prescription in the first place and is completely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  It is probably another instance of how the State has in a certain sense exercised control of women's bodies and has displayed distrust of the choices women made regarding their reproductive health.  Who are the people who are most victimised by these decisions?  In the same way as in all aspects, it is working class women, poor women and those who do not have the economic means who are targeted because they are the ones whose decision-making is affected because they do not have the means to exercise it.  What other impression can a women with a medical card come away with other than that this provision exists in order that a doctor can, more or less, keep an eye on her sexual choices and intervene if necessary by saying she is not getting one?  It is ludicrous.  It is like a throwback to decades past.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale offered for forcing women with medical cards or long-term illness cards to jump through these extra hoops if they want to get access to what is, in a sense, essential medicine is pathetic, with the Department saying that a number of policy issues would need to be considered before this could be contemplated, including the potential cost from loss of prescription charges or otherwise.  I would like to know what these policy decisions are.  Is it an administrative issue?  I cannot believe that it is insurmountable.  If another group, for example, well-heeled businessmen, was affected by a decision, I am sure a way around it could be found.  I do not accept the argument that no solution to the administrative difficulties can be found.  Were any solutions explored because it is a bit of a double standard?<\/p>  <p>  We expect women to take responsibility for their reproductive health - for when they have children - but if we are not going to give equal access to essential reproductive medication and drugs such as the morning-after pill, it does introduce discrimination.  It is exactly the same mentality that gave us the eighth amendment and a scenario whereby if someone has money, she can travel and exercise her legal right to have an abortion in another jurisdiction but if someone is poor, a migrant or of limited status, she cannot.  It is the old scenario whereby women who have money can travel while women who cannot travel have children, in some instances, when they are not ready or are without the means to support them.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth looking back and pointing out that prescription charges were introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is the great hero of change now but it introduced prescription charges in July 2010 as part of the first round of the suite of austerity measures.  The former Minister for Health, James Reilly, who is my constituency colleague, said it was vehemently opposed by Fine Gael at that time and that is true.  What is interesting is that the former Minister anticipated the situation correctly.  He said at the time, \"it is clear that once the Minister gets this charge under the door, it will continue to increase\".  How right he was because the charge started out at 50 cent and after nearly six years of Fine Gael in Government, it is &euro;2.50.  The former Minister said in 2011 that it was very unfortunate that he had to defer the removal of the charge, which was then 50 cent, saying that getting rid of it had been one of his goals when entering office.  Now we have Fine Gael building discriminatory provisions into legislation on the basis of a prescription charge to which it was once vehemently opposed.  This is discrimination in an area where Fine Gael said it never wanted to go.  Fine Gael campaigned in the previous general election on the basis that the economy was in recovery.  Why then do we still have prescription charges for medical card holders given that they were supposed to be an emergency measure when they were brought in?  Why are we endangering the health of women with medical cards or long-term illness cards on the basis of a charge that should not be levied in the first place?  It does not make any sense.  We are putting a barrier in the way of women who want to access emergency contraception and we could certainly address this aspect.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the discriminatory aspect of forcing women with medical cards to jump through hoops to get access to essential medicine, there are major health implications for forcing them to wait until they see a doctor.  A person can often wait a considerable period of time to see a doctor to get a prescription before they can then take the emergency contraception.  The morning-after pill declines in efficiency the more time passes between having unprotected sex and taking the pill, so it is 95% effective if it is taken within 24 hours of having sex, but is only 58% effective if it is taken within 48 to 72 hours of having sex.<\/p><p>In my area, one would be doing well to get an appointment with a GP within 24 hours.  One would be very luck to get one.  It is unacceptable to force people who have medical cards to do this to access that to which the rest of us have access.<\/p> <p> In April 2015, the Irish  Pharmacy Union, IPU, called on the HSE to make the morning after pill directly available to GMS patients from pharmacies free of charge, calling the system whereby GMS patients have to get a prescription for the pill \"farcical, discriminatory and unacceptable.\"  Yet, that system is enshrined in legislation.  The IPU pointed out that 77% of pharmacy consultations about the morning after pill occur within 24 hours of unprotected sex and noted that this shows how important it is that the pill be readily available to women as soon as they need it.  It is a basic health care product and it would be regrettable if we maintained that discriminatory concept in this piece of legislation.  The IPU presented a proposal to improve access to emergency contraception to the Minister for Health's predecessor, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  The proposal made the Minister aware that, \"The process of [a woman] attending her GP for a prescription puts an unnecessary barrier in her way and causes unnecessary delay and inconvenience.\"  It outlined practical steps for the cost of the drug to be reimbursed by the HSE without the need for a prescription using unified claims forms carrying the patients' medical card number.  I do not see why this could not be done and I do not know why the Government did not listen to the sensible proposal which could have been adopted as part of the Bill.<\/p> <p> We are left with a farcical, discriminatory and unacceptable system being enshrined in law.  The Bill should have addressed the issue of access to the morning after pill, without prescription, for medical card patients.  This is being ignored and it is regrettable.  I hope the Minister will take on board some of these points, which are critical against the backdrop of the debate in which Irish society is engaged regarding reproductive rights and women taking responsibility for decisions about their reproductive systems and bodily autonomy.  Crisis pregnancy is common.  Let us be clear - one in three women with an experience of pregnancy has experienced a crisis pregnancy.  In Ireland, if one cannot access emergency contraception, or if one accesses it too late because the Government has forced one to make an appointment with one's doctor in order to get a prescription, and one finds oneself pregnant and unable to deal with the situation, one's only option is to travel abroad if one wants to end the crisis pregnancy.  The fact that the Irish State forces women to travel for abortions makes it very difficult for poorer women to access this essential medical procedure.  Again, the poorer women are those before whom the legislation will put up barriers regarding their ability to access emergency contraception.  That is not right.<\/p> <p> I do not accept that the administrative hurdles that need to be leaped in order to make it possible for women to access emergency contraception without a prescription could not have been addressed relatively easily.  Provisions regarding women's health, particularly reproductive health, are utterly demoralising.  No bar is too low.  We see it in abortion access, maternity services and, now, the discriminatory provisions in the Bill.  It is ironic that lack of access to emergency contraception is almost like enforcing pregnancy on some people.  Yet the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, came before the health committee last week and apologised for the manner in which maternity services had let women and their children down.  Maternity services are brutally understaffed and women's lives have been placed at risk as a result.  At least eight maternity services are under investigation due to safety issues regarding the deaths of women or children.  It is estimated that there is 20% understaffing of midwives in the three Dublin hospitals, at which account 40% of births in this country take place.  Nationally, we are down more than 200 whole-time equivalent midwives.  This is serious.  Forcing somebody to carry on a pregnancy is not something I would favour.  We need to level the playing field in terms of access to emergency contraception and I appeal to the Minister to examine the issue.<\/p> <p> Part 3 of the Bill amends the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 to allow payments from certain redress schemes to be exempt from means testing for the fair deal scheme.  The fair deal scheme involves elderly citizens paying 80% of their income towards nursing home care plus 7.5% of the value of any assets per annum up to a maximum of 22.5% of the value of their principal residence if that is their only asset.  The State pays the balance.  There is a major crisis in nursing care provision, caused particularly by over-reliance on the private market and the deliberate running down of what used to be State nursing homes which people could access.  It is frightening.  Nursing home care costs between &euro;800 and &euro;1,200 per week.  The vast majority of nursing homes are private.  There are approximately 84 private nursing homes in Dublin compared to 20 public homes.  This is the wrong way around.  The result is that huge sums of money are channelled into private pockets every year from elderly citizens and the State to provide nursing home care.  I have mentioned before how investment in nursing homes in advertised as a no-brainer for private investors, given the high rate of returns on investment they can expect.  The return on investment and the profit they can expect comes out of the pockets of elderly citizens and the State.  It is reprehensible.<\/p> <p> The way we treat older citizens in Ireland is at variance with what happens in many other European countries.  In countries such as Italy and Spain, older people are respected, looked after and recognised for the contribution they have made through rearing families and during their working lives.  Here, older people are nearly viewed as a sort of hindrance that should be cast aside and forgotten about.  The fact that we have allowed the care of the elderly and nursing home provision to remain in the hands of the private sector is criminal.<\/p> <p> The Bill specifies that the symphysiotomy redress scheme is one of the schemes to be exempt from means testing for the fair deal scheme.  While I welcome the exemption for the symphysiotomy redress payments, I could not allow the scheme to be mentioned in legislation without using the opportunity to highlight the enormous problems with the structure and administration of the symphysiotomy redress scheme.  It is a travesty that international media outlets such as al-Jazeera have publicised the damage done to older Irish women as a result of the procedure whereas the Irish media have given it hardly any consideration.  The scheme was designed with budgetary considerations in mind rather than justice and making a right from a wrong that was done to those women.<\/p><p>It is a scheme that is antagonistic and distrustful of the women involved.<\/p> <p> Let us be clear about what it is and how it came about.  These women were butchered against their will and, in many instances, without their knowledge of the procedure having been carried out.  Their pelvic bones were sawn in half, often while they were awake and watching, in order to facilitate their having multiple pregnancies.  We are back to pregnancies and reproductive rights.  Surprise, surprise.  As a result of this butchery, many of the women were left incontinent, with pelvic and back pain, difficulty walking, psychological damage, difficulty connecting with their kids and so on.  It was an horrendous abuse of women who often were very young.  Of a slight build, they were deemed unable to undergo Caesarean sections because that would have limited their childbearing years and they would only have been able to have perhaps three children.  To let them at it and procreate as was intended, their pelvic bones were instead cut open.  What was done was disgraceful.<\/p> <p> The scheme was set up to redress some of the pain and injustice that these women experienced, but we must be honest, in that the manner in which the scheme has been implemented has actually resulted in more pain and distress for them.  Payments from the scheme have been paltry relative to the damage done.  That payments are anchored at &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and a maximum of &euro;150,000 for lifelong pain and disability is crazy.  According to the figures, the majority of women were restricted to smaller payments.  In this sense, they were denied even basic compensation.  They were asked for records and were scrutinised for validity, as if anyone would make this stuff up and look for that money based on records that, in some instances, did not exist.  Given the pain that had been suffered, this was poor.  The scheme was limited, offered no right of appeal and provided no protection for the women's legal rights.  As some of the participants have mentioned, the scheme forces women to indemnify their abusers as the price for getting a bit of redress.  The scheme refused to take on board the oral testimony of survivors, depending instead on a paper trail that traced back more than 50 years.  That trail can be incomplete and, without a complete record, the scheme will reject an application or offer a lower payment.  It is unreasonable to expect that those records would survive after so long.<\/p> <p> If no trace of a general practitioner's record dating from the 1950s can be found, which we know is most likely because it has been destroyed, then the scheme tells the women that they do not actually have the chronic incontinence or whatever they have had their entire lives and will not pay them the compensation.  They are told that they do not actually have the disability that has meant they have been unable to go to the shops or wherever, that the reality they have been living is not true.  I have seen some of the letters sent by the justice who administers the scheme, although \"justice\" is the wrong word in this regard.  The letter more or less told the woman to buy herself something nice out of the money.  That is an utter violation of these women's experiences and negates the good in the scheme.<\/p> <p> Of course, exempting the payments that the women have received from an assessment under the fair deal scheme is good.  It is the least that the Government can do.  To be honest, though, a reconstitution and re-examination of the scheme and a recognition that a payment of &euro;50,000 for lifelong agony is inadequate would be a better and more respectful way to deal with these women.<\/p> <p> The final aspect of the Bill that I wish to discuss relates to payments to board members of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  According to the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill, there is \"an onerous responsibility and significant time commitment placed on members of the Authority\" and, as such, they should be paid for it.  That is kind of fine but, viewing this in a balanced way, the HPRA failed to include a warning about possible kidney damage that had been issued by the maker of the drug Lariam on its website for more than one year because of what the authority called an administrative error.  It is good if efforts are being made to reduce the chance of administrative errors being made by the authority, since the HPRA needs such measures.  If that is the reason for this provision in the Bill, I welcome it.  However, I am unsure because some of the drugs licensed for use in this country are profoundly dangerous.  It is a fact.  Lariam is a perfect example.  It is fortuitous that we are discussing this Bill on the day that PDFORRA, the soldiers' organisation, held its annual conference and spoke about this matter.<\/p> <p> The HPRA has an important job because it is the body that licenses drugs and publicises their dangers.  A drug like Lariam, which is neurotoxic, can leave those who take it with permanent psychological impairments, psychosis and depression.  We have met many survivors, dignified members of the Defence Forces who served this country proudly, went abroad and were prescribed Lariam and whose lives have never been the same since.  On the HPRA's list of the ten medicines most frequently associated with suicide attempts, suicidal ideation and self-harm, Lariam is at the top and miles ahead of the other drugs.  There is a strong link between taking Lariam and self-harm, thoughts of suicide and suicide.  While the HPRA issues warnings about Lariam on the one hand, members of our Defence Forces are still forced to take it by our Government on the other because it believes that Lariam should be the first choice for soldiers going to sub-Saharan Africa.  For other armed forces, including those of the US, France and Germany, Lariam is the last resort drug.  In most countries, it is not even used.  The British House of Commons Select Defence Committee published a highly critical report on the use of Lariam, going as far as recommending that its use by Ministry of Defence personnel be banned.  The Australian Department of Defence has acknowledged that short-term and long-term side effects can result from the use of Lariam and that those suffering such side effects can claim compensation.<\/p> <p> I have a problem.  Given that we are discussing payment for and the enhancement of an organisation that oversees how drugs are advertised and monitored, we should examine this situation.  He who pays the piper calls the tune and so forth.  If so, we must demand a transformed system of accountability for how drugs are administered.  I used the example of Lariam because it was in the news today and because of its devastating consequences for the lives of young people who served the State loyally.  We have seen them - they have been in the Public Gallery.  Their lives have been ruined, their families left with loving parents and spouses who cannot function properly because of how this drug was administered.  If we are beefing up and making improvements to the authority, we must be sure that it is doing its job properly.<\/p><p>We absolutely need to be sure that these people are doing their job properly.  In that sense, there is a long way to go.  I will leave it at that and we can continue the debate later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400043#QQ00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475608500,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy Shortall as we are just out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400046#TT00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1475608500,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1475608500,"counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400046#TT00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1475608500,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>I propose to share time with my colleague, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, who is co-sponsoring the Bill.  I am delighted to bring forward the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016 before the D&aacute;il.  This Bill essentially seeks to tackle hate crimes in an effective and a robust manner.  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for equality, I am sponsoring it along with my colleague, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, our party spokesperson on disability.  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony will address the disability-specific issues in her contribution.  Legislation is fundamental to demonstrate the State's intolerance of hate and to allow for hostility to be measured and challenged.  This Bill can provide a positive route to improving State responses and although the implementation will always need strong and inclusive leadership, these proposals should provide the foundations for an effective solution.<\/p><p>The 2011 census established that diversity is now a concrete fact of life for Ireland.  Shifting patterns have changed the racial, ethnic and religious composition of Irish society.  This change in society has not been welcomed by all and for some, diversity represents a threat to &quot;Irishness&quot; and frequently meets with violent opposition.  Hate crime has become a fact of life in Ireland.  Yet, alone among European nations, Ireland has not introduced statutory protections from hate crime.  If the harm of hate is to be acknowledged and countered, this D&aacute;il must act to provide a legislative framework for the explicit naming of bias crime.  Ireland must join other nations in ensuring that the violence of hate experienced by vulnerable individuals and communities is challenged head-on.<\/p><p>In a society that expounds principles of inclusivity and diversity, which was founded on the idea that all people should be cherished equally, and which has recently celebrated the welcoming and embracing of difference, crimes of hate are simply unacceptable.  It should not be the responsibility of victims to avoid being targets of hate crime; it is the responsibility of the Legislature to send a clear message to society that this behaviour is not tolerated.  It is then the responsibility of the criminal justice system to ensure this message is operational.  By adopting our legislative proposals, we hope to provide tools that society needs to combat criminal expressions of hatred, hostility, prejudice, bias and contempt.<\/p><p>The human rights of some living in Ireland are currently being violated on a daily basis in a manner that is deeply damaging to both individuals and society.  In the absence of an adequate criminal justice response to hate crime offenders, victims continue to pay for these crimes.  Research provides convincing evidence that victims of hate crimes suffer more severely than victims of equivalent crimes that are not associated with targeted hostility.  Victims of hate crime cannot simply assert that their experience was an unlucky occurrence or a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Instead, they are forced to accept that their social identity was targeted and they remain at risk of repeat victimisation.<\/p><p>Our proposed Bill will ensure the option is open to the Garda and Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue a hate crime conviction should such an offence have occurred.  It has been pointed out for some time now that Ireland is out of step with the majority of countries in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the European Union in that we have made no legal provision for hate crime in this country.  That is what this Bill seeks to do; it will make provision for aggravation by prejudice of offences in circumstances where an offence, when, at the time of commission, is accompanied by prejudice relating to the race, colour or ethnic origin, a disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity of a person and to provide for related matters if so proven.  This Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016 proposes that when an offence occurs and that offence is aggravated by prejudice relating to colour or ethnic origin, a disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity of the person against whom the offence is committed and when it is stated in either an indictment or a complaint, or both, that an offence is aggravated by prejudice, then on conviction, the court shall find that the offence is aggravated by prejudice relating to race, colour or ethnic origin.  The court shall also record the conviction in a manner that demonstrates that it is an offence aggravated by prejudice and will take this into account when determining the sentence.  Where the sentence in respect of the offence is different from that which the court would have imposed if the offence was not aggravated, it shall state the extent of and the reasons for that difference.  Therefore, the effect of this Bill would be that the courts would have to consider an offender's prejudice or hatred towards these groups and sentence the offender accordingly.<\/p><p>Currently we have the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 in place.  This Act makes it an offence to incite hatred against a particular group but it does not criminalise those who commit the crimes against that group except under general legislation.  We also need to bear in mind how much Ireland has changed since that time.  As the Immigrant Council of Ireland has pointed out, it is now two decades since immigration into Ireland commenced and it is time for our laws to reflect the major changes that have taken place.  Ireland is behind the curve when it comes to having effective legislation in place to deal with hate crimes.  Currently, we do not have specific hate crime laws and such legislation is needed.  This will help make it clear that such hatred will not be tolerated in our society.  Similar legislation is in place in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales and many non-governmental organisations and voluntary bodies have been highlighting the need for hate crime legislation.<\/p><p>It is possible too that we are not in compliance with the implementation of the European Council's 2008 framework decision on combatting certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law.  The 2008 framework decision states that with regard to hate crime, &quot;member states<i><\/i>must ensure that racist and xenophobic motivation is considered as an aggravating circumstance, or alternatively that such motivation may be taken into account by the courts in determining the applicable penalties.&quot;<\/p><p>In July, shortly before I moved this Bill in the D&aacute;il, the Rape Crisis Network insisted that we need to introduce hate crime legislation in this country.  A report published by the Rape Crisis Network indicates that lesbian, gay, bisexual or transexual, LGBT, survivors were more likely to have experienced multiple incidents of sexual abuse and they generally took longer to report these incidents.  The director, Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar, said hate crime legislation would make it easier to protect vulnerable LGBT victims.  The report, based on research during 2013, had many alarming findings, such as that lesbian, gay and bisexual survivors have higher levels of multiple incidents of sexual violence than heterosexual survivors.  Gay and bisexual males had almost twice the levels of rape of heterosexual males, at 63% compared with 34%.  Moreover, 47% of lesbian, gay or bisexual survivors waited more than ten years to report the abuse, compared with 21% of heterosexual survivors.  As Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar, director of Rape Crisis Network, commented, &quot;the evidence in this report makes a strong case for the need for hate crime legislation.  LGBT people are targeted by homophobia and hate.&quot;<\/p><p>Similarly, the LGBTIreland report for 2016 found that LGBT people face levels of discrimination and harassment and that many LGBT people cannot be themselves in their daily lives.  The report indicates significant levels of harassment or discrimination experienced by LGBT people in Ireland.<\/p><p>Up to one third of participants had experienced verbal harassment or threats of violence due to being LGBT while 21% had been punched, hit or physically attacked during their lifetime.  A shocking 75% experienced being verbally hurt, more than 50% would feel unsafe or very unsafe holding the hand of their same-sex partner and 15% had been sexually attacked.  Many of us know many of these people.<\/p> <p> The Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, makes the point that information about violence and harassment against LGBT people is very limited because of the under-reporting of such experiences.  In order for the Garda S&iacute;ochana to provide comprehensive services and strategies to tackle this violence, there must be a full understanding of the true extent of such occurrences.  This corresponds with the European Council's 2008 framework which found that under-reporting is common for hate speech and hate crime.  According to the CSO, there were 113 hate crimes recorded in 2013, 94 of which were racist, two were anti-Semitic and 17 were homophobic.  The European Network Against Racism Ireland recorded 137 religiously or racially aggravated crimes in 2014 while between December 2014 and June 2015, GLEN recorded 19 homophobic or transphobic crimes.  In 2015, 240 racist incidents were reported to the Immigrant Council of Ireland compared to 217 in 2014.<\/p> <p> The introduction of hate crime legislation is also backed by those at the forefront of the fight against racism.  In bringing forward this Bill this evening, I am very conscious that a number of NGOs and voluntary bodies have indicated a belief that it is in need of amendment.  Let me be clear that I am absolutely fine with that.  I am happy to discuss and agree amendments to this legislation.  Indeed, I may very well bring some amendments forward myself should the House agree to allow this Bill to progress to Committee Stage.  My primary concern and that of my party is to get hate crime legislation onto the Statute Book.  It is vital that this House sends a clear message that crimes motivated and exacerbated by prejudice and hatred will not be tolerated.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing other Members' contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400046#TT00500","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475609100,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to bring this very important Bill to the House because it represents an important step forward in the pursuit of equality and justice for all of our citizens.  As a constitutional republican party, Fianna F&aacute;il has always been committed to fighting discrimination in all forms.  In government, Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward policies and legislation to advance the rights of people with disabilities.  Our proactive approach in government made a positive impact on the lives of people with disabilities.  Fianna F&aacute;il was the first Irish party ever to set out a comprehensive commitment to address the specific needs and rights of people with disabilities.  During our time in government, there was a dramatic change in terms of legislation, planning, specialist service provision and access to mainstream services and activities for people with disabilities.  To that end, the first national disability strategy was developed and commenced.  The strategy set out a comprehensive package of legislation, policies and targets.  In addition, thousands of day, residential and respite care places were created while a mandatory quota for the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector was also put in place.  These are just some examples of the progress we achieved while in government.<\/p><p>This Bill is a vital step forward in further advancing and protecting the rights of people with disabilities because if passed, it will make it an offence to commit a crime motivated by prejudice.  Violent offences motivated by bias, hostility, contempt, malice, or bigotry - in effect, hate crimes - must be legislated for and Ireland is one of the few EU member states without effective hate crime legislation.  Indeed, research conducted in 2015 by the Hate and Hostility Research Group, HHRG, at the University of Limerick found that hate crime lives in the shadows of Irish criminal justice and is systematically &quot;disappeared&quot; from the criminal justice process.  The researchers argue that no one organisation or policy is at fault in this process but that it is a system-wide failure to recognise the harms of hate.  Systematic blindness results in a &quot;disappearing&quot; of the hate element of many crimes in the criminal justice process and a failure to provide victims with appropriate protection under the law.  The researchers went on to point out that this disappearing of hate crime from the criminal justice system is most particular in the case of disability hate crime.<\/p><p>Based on data from the 2011 census, 13% of the Irish population is classified as having a disability.  Research has shown that living with a disability affects people in multiple ways.  People with disabilities are more likely to experience poverty and deprivation, have lower levels of educational attainment and are less likely to participate in the labour market.  While people with disabilities face structural and cultural barriers that can prevent them from participating fully in society, research by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights shows that violence, harassment and abuse are also regular occurrences for many people with disabilities, creating another barrier to their inclusion and participation in the community, thereby reinforcing the exclusion of an already marginalised group.  This is then compounded by the fact that crime is often not understood, forgotten about or considered of lesser significance than hate crimes motivated by racism, religious intolerance, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.<\/p><p>This Bill is a very positive step forward in enhancing and protecting the rights of persons with a disability.  It is my hope that this Bill will not only make hate crime based on disability an offence but will also improve the reporting and recording of disability hate crime which is generally considered to be under-reported.  Disability hate crimes may be one-off incidents or systematic abuse that may continue over periods of weeks, months or even years.  It can happen between strangers who have never met, between friends or within the family.  However, it occurs and it is important that we have the relevant statistics and accurate reporting to help us improve the situation for victims as well as identify ways to reduce and eliminate hate crime.<\/p><p>While this proposed legislation is a vital step, it should operate in tandem with awareness raising and further research into disability hate crime so that we have a fuller picture of the forms that such crime can take, its effects and consequences.  This proposed legislation must also be looked at in the context of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities which was signed by Ireland in 2007.  A commitment has been given in the programme for Government to put the ratification before the Houses of Oireachtas by the end of 2016.  Ratification will represent a huge step forward in advancing the rights of people with a disability in Ireland and will demonstrate this country's commitment, albeit late in the day, to promoting and protecting the full enjoyment of human rights by people with disabilities and ensuring they have full equality under the law.  <\/p><p>The convention covers a wide range of areas, including health, education, employment, access to justice, personal security, independent living and access to information.  This proposed Bill complements the convention and will help to ensure that the State lives up to its commitment under Article 16 of the convention to take &quot;all appropriate legislative, administrative, social, educational and other measures to protect persons with disabilities, both within and outside the home, from all forms of exploitation, violence and abuse&quot;.  It is my sincere hope that the Government makes ratification a priority and in the coming weeks puts in place the legislative changes that are required to ratify the convention.<i><\/i><\/p><p>Every person has an equal right to be protected by the criminal justice system.  Stopping disability hate crime and bringing perpetrators to justice must be a priority.  As elected representatives and legislators, we have a duty to put in place mechanisms that will counter the prejudice, hostility and violence that people can experience as a consequence of disability.  By legislating for disability hate crime and raising awareness of it, we can improve the inclusion of people with disabilities into our communities.  However, we must not limit our responses to disability hate crime to the justice system alone.  We must work at all levels of society to challenge discrimination and prejudice and ensure that people with disabilities are treated as full and equal citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400047#UU00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1475609100,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Margaret Murphy O'Mahony and Fiona O'Loughlin for introducing this Bill.  No one could disagree with the purpose of the Bill which aims to ensure that where an offence is committed against a person that is motivated by prejudice or hate relating to the victim's race, colour, ethnic origin, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identification, motivation will be taken into account for the purposes of determining sentence.<\/p><p>The issue of legislating for crime motivated by prejudice against another person has increasingly been the subject of discussion.  It has been argued that introducing such provisions recognises the impact such crimes have on victims.  While I would agree with that view, I believe aspects of the Bill before the House require further consideration.  I refer, for example, to provisions that could give rise to unintended operational difficulties in the prosecution of these offences.<br\/><br\/>Currently, if an offence such as assault or criminal damage is committed against a person based on his or her race, religion, sexual orientation or other identity characteristics, the offence is prosecuted as an offence under the wider criminal law.  The judgment of the Court of Appeal in DPP <i>v<\/i>. Elders in 2014 unequivocally states that racist motivation is an aggravating factor for the purpose of sentencing.  It is open to a judge to consider any other bias motivation as an aggravating factor in the same way.  In effect, if in the course of a criminal trial it is demonstrated that some form of bias motivated the offence, a judge may consider that in sentencing.  This is in line with the requirement on all sentencing courts when determining a sentence to take into account both the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender.  Under the provisions of the Bill before the House, bias motivation cannot be taken into account unless it is stated in the indictment or complaint and it is proven that the offence is so aggravated.  I ask the Deputies to consider that this could in fact be a significant restriction on existing judicial discretion.<br\/><br\/>I would like to mention some other potential issues with this legislation.  The Bill, as drafted, applies to all offences on the Statute Book.  It appears to be modelled on the UK Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which specifies the criminal offences to which it applies, namely, assaults, criminal damage, public order offences and harassment.  I believe the more targeted approach of identifying the specific offences to which the Bill would apply is preferred and would avoid any possible problems in prosecution.  Clearly, the Bill could not be applied to the offence of murder, for which the mandatory sentence is imprisonment for life.  It is also in respect of successfully prosecuting offences that I have other concerns relating to the Bill.  As I have mentioned, the Bill requires the aggravation by prejudice to be proven, whereas it is currently sufficient for bias motivation to be demonstrated during the trial for a court to take it into account as an aggravating factor for the purpose of sentencing.  By establishing a higher standard in this regard, this Bill could limit the circumstances in which bias motivation could be taken into account during sentencing.  I also have concerns about how the provision in the Bill whereby &quot;it is proved&quot; that an offence is so aggravated would work in practice.  As I have said, the Bill does not create an offence <i>per se<\/i>.  When a trial involves a jury, it makes a determination on the offence with which the person is charged, such as assault.  Under what circumstances would the motivation be determined?  If it is not a matter for the jury, and I do not see how it can be, it seems difficult to envisage how this would operate in practice.  It does not seem appropriate for a court following a verdict of guilty from a jury to state that the offence was aggravated in the manner set out in the Bill where this was not a matter determined by the jury.  Clearly, this matter needs to be clarified before the Bill proceeds further.<br\/><br\/>While this is one of the more challenging aspects of the Bill, I would like to highlight some other issues which are perhaps more straightforward to address.  For instance, the Bill provides for the aggravation of sentences for offences based on race, colour, ethnic origin, disability, sexual orientation and transgender identification.  I would be grateful if the sponsoring Deputies could clarify whether they considered including other forms of prejudice within the Bill, such as prejudice based on religious intolerance or a person being a member of the Traveller community or prejudice based on a person's gender beyond that provided for under section 4.  I mention religion, gender and membership of the Traveller community specifically as these groups are protected under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, which prohibits actions which are likely to stir up hatred against particular groups.  There seems to be a case that any group identified for the purpose of protection from incitement to hatred should equally be protected under legislation along the lines of the Bill that has been presented today.<br\/><br\/>I believe there is a difficulty with the vagueness of certain terms in the Bill.  For instance, the Bill provides that an offence is aggravated by prejudice if &quot;at the time of committing the offence or immediately before or after so committing, a person evinces towards a victim of said offence, malice or ill-will&quot;.  The concept of &quot;ill-will&quot; is not defined and is potentially difficult to prove.  I also have questions about the definition of &quot;disability&quot; in this Bill, which is based on the definition contained in the Disability Act 2005.  I think that definition might be too narrow, given the purpose of this Bill.  I am sure this can be considered further by the Deputies who introduced this Bill.  I noted Deputy O'Loughlin's confirmation that she would be open to considering amendments and ongoing improvements to the Bill.  I am highlighting these issues because I think they need to be considered.  Despite the concerns I have highlighted, I do not oppose the principle of this Bill.  I raise these issues to highlight areas that merit further consideration if the Bill is to achieve its purpose and not have unintended consequences.  I ask the Deputies to reflect on these issues.<br\/><br\/>The whole question of hate-motivated crime is under consideration in my Department.  This involves a review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 as well as ongoing consultation with the European Commission on the State's implementation of the framework decision on racism and xenophobia.  The latter is part of the Commission's EU-wide review of the implementation of that particular framework decision.  This is in line with recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report on harmful communications and digital safety, which was published last week.  While one of the issues addressed in that report concerns online hate speech, the report recommends a wider reform of hate crime, which would include hate speech.  I would like it if this Bill and the discussions here tonight could feed into the ongoing work in my Department on this issue.<br\/><br\/>As I am sure the Deputies present will agree, addressing hate crime and hate speech is not simply a matter of introducing tough legislation.  The many people who have responsibility for working on these issues can make a difference by taking a variety of other actions.  For example, the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office has responsibility for co-ordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  This is an ever-increasing issue, given the changing population in this country.  In addition, Garda ethnic liaison officers work directly with minority communities at local level.  As Deputies are aware, many non-governmental organisations are working on a range of diversity issues.  I note the research that has been done by both Deputies on the challenges facing many of the people this Bill is intended to address.  Despite the passing of the marriage equality Bill last year, it is clear that we must continue to be alert to ongoing issues of discrimination.<br\/><br\/>The same point can be made with regard to disability.  I am happy to confirm to the House that we will make the further legislative changes that are necessary to sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the end of this year.  The Department of Health has to do some additional work before that will be possible.  In addition to the work of the Garda, my Department's office for the promotion of migrant integration is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy.  Later this year, we will publish the Government's integration strategy, which has already been the subject of a great deal of consultation.  I think that will be a very important marker of the State's approach to the question of integration and the kind of issues we need to address.  I thank the Deputies for bringing forward this Bill.  I welcome the debate we are having today.  I repeat that we do not intend to oppose the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400047#UU00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475609700,"counter":429,"content":"<p>In the spirit of providing constructive opposition, I will begin by welcoming the opportunity to debate the issue of hate crime legislation.  I also welcome the initiative of Deputies O'Loughlin and Murphy O'Mahony in prioritising the introduction of a Bill to put hate crime legislation on Ireland's Statute Book.  Over recent years, a number of non-governmental organisations and human rights groups have repeatedly called on the Government to legislate for specific hate crimes.  In particular, they have called for the introduction of legislation to cover crimes against people from minority religious and racial groups.  Unfortunately, this State is no stranger to hate crimes.  Declan Flynn was murdered in Fairview in 1982 for being gay.<\/p><p>In 2002, a 29 year old Chinese student was beaten repeatedly with metal bars as his attackers shouted racial slurs.  As recently as 2010, two Polish men were stabbed in the head with screwdrivers after being racially abused.  There are many other such instances.<\/p> <p> The aim of hate crime legislation is to provide for an enhanced sentence if merited if an attack has taken place because of a bias held by the attacker.  It may be a bias on the grounds of race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability or religion.  An attack carried out because of this bias, in my opinion, sends a message to minority groups that they are different, not wanted or not welcome.  It is only fair, then, that these attacks should warrant extended criminal prosecutions, indictments and provisions, given the effect they have on an entire community.  Sinn F&eacute;in, a party with a true republican ideology, has always and will always view all of Ireland's inhabitants as equal.  As the justice and equality spokesperson on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I have been disappointed at the lack of hate crime legislation to date, as has the Minister.  I know that the Minister is preparing a Bill, a move we welcome.  Sinn F&eacute;in understands that many minority groups in today's society believe they are completely marginalised and at risk of attack because of their skin colour, religion, sexuality, disability or ethnicity.  However, this proposed legislation is no more than a proposal.  It is an attempt, a poorly-constructed attempt at that.<\/p> <p> Section 1 deals with the interpretation of the Bill.  If the authors are tripping up at the first obstacle, then we have to wonder what hope there is for the rest of the Bill.  I will outline the problems I have identified.  These and other problems have been identified by NGOs as well.  Even the Minister has outlined some of the difficulties in the proposed legislation.<\/p> <p> Section 1 provides an interpretation of the term \"disability\".  The Minister has expressed her view on this.  It links back to the Disability Act 2005.  It is important for people with disabilities that they are protected by such legislation and the inclusion of this measure is warmly welcomed.  However, neither of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have made any attempt to describe ethnicities, origin or race to enable them to be covered in this Bill.  I wondered whether I had misread the legislation when I discovered that in the interpretation of the Bill, there was a clear omission in respect of giving any description to these vital factors.<\/p> <p> I am unsure how a judge or jury could make a ruling on whether a defendant is guilty of a prejudiced attack on the grounds of race or ethnicity if no guidelines whatsoever are included in respect of protected ethnicity or race in the Bill.  Judges and juries already have a difficult job without having to become accomplished mind-readers in the middle of a trial.  The Minister has pointed out the difficulties in the Bill in this regard.  It is proposed that if there is a prejudice, it would have to be stated on the indictment and could not be formulated during the course of the trial.  That is counter-productive.<\/p> <p> I find it insulting to the many members of the Traveller community in Ireland that Fianna F&aacute;il simply did not bother to take this opportunity to classify their group as a protected ethnic minority in Ireland.  Pavee Point, various other groups and Sinn F&eacute;in have repeatedly called for this on behalf of the Irish Traveller community.  These calls have been consistently ignored by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government.  Then again, I suppose if the brother of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party leader and his colleague objected to a vote in favour of classifying Travellers as a protected ethnic minority on Cork City Council, why would I expect Fianna F&aacute;il to behave any differently at a national level?<\/p> <p> Section 1 offers protection to members of the LGBT community, including those who are transgender.  This is another point I welcome.  After the support last year for the marriage rights referendum for the LGBT community, I imagine we can all agree that there is still a need to protect the community with hate crime legislation.  However, I believe this Bill has fallen short in protecting a number of subgroups within the LGBTQ community.  Specifically, there is no mention in this legislation of protection for people on the basis of their gender identity or gender expression.  While there is always a need to include gender as a protected ground in any new law, this Bill excludes those who might be targeted on the basis of cisgender identity.  I wish to bring to the attention of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies present the repeated calls by the European Network Against Racism to withdraw the Bill in favour of examining the existing heads of a Bill from 2015.  The heads in question were drafted by ENAR and more than 60 NGOs working in the area of hate crime.  A detailed Bill was produced and ENAR has asked that it be considered by the Oireachtas.  That Bill was drafted on the back of a report following the establishment of a working group.  Unfortunately, that has not materialised.<\/p> <p> Shane O'Curry, director of ENAR, has expressed concern on the question this week.  He said this Bill is fundamentally flawed and that passing it would be deeply counter-productive.  That opinion is shared by a coalition of more than 60 NGOs, academics and authors.  They have stated that the Bill is so deeply problematic as to render it unworkable and unamendable.  It uses outdated language and does not cover trans people, Travellers, refugees or asylum seekers.  This is a glaring oversight, unfortunately, one I find difficult to understand, given that I come from a community with a growing population of differing religions.<\/p> <p> According to reports in recent years from Migrants Rights Centre Ireland and the European Network Against Racism, there has been a marked increase in attacks on people of African origin.  Furthermore, there is evidence in my constituency in Cork of a rise in attacks against people of Islamic faith.  <\/p> <p> Despite all of this, the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill neglects to mention what ethnicities or origins are covered under attacks of prejudice.  In many other jurisdictions, clear parameters are set out.  The nature of a prejudiced attack is that it is prejudiced because it has been perpetrated against a member of a protected ethnicity or race.  Without these parameters, this legislation is unworkable in court.  Again, the Minister has made this point.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies may have forgotten to include those parameters when they copied and pasted many sections of the Bill from Scottish legislation.  There are numerous similarities between the Scottish legislation and this Bill.  These have been identified not only by me and my party but also by the European Network Against Racism and the many bodies on which ENAR frequently calls for advice, including the hate and hostility research group in the University of Limerick.  I am afraid to say it but this Bill is essentially a copy-and-paste of Scottish law but this is not Scotland.  This is a frightening example of lazy legislating.  Ireland has a significantly different criminal justice context.  We have constitutional requirements in respect of which Scottish law takes a different approach.  These include the guarantee of equality and freedom of expression and the requirement for certainty.  Without addressing these constitutional points, the Bill is simply unworkable.<\/p> <p> ENAR has also noted that there is absolutely no mention of coverage in this Bill for members of minority religious groups.  That is staggering.  I am unsure whether this has been done by accident or design.  Either way, Fianna F&aacute;il has actually further marginalised those who are already struggling to integrate in this State by excluding them from legislation, the purpose of which is to protect these very same groups.  Hate crime is not about protecting minority groups that Fianna F&aacute;il may earn votes from.  It is about providing legal protection to all minorities against attacks because of race, religion, ethnicity, disability, gender expression or sexual orientation.  It would seem that in producing this Bill, Fianna F&aacute;il has actually marginalised more groups that it proposes to protect.<\/p><p>It is not just my party that is unhappy with the Bill.  Several interest groups, human rights groups, non-governmental organisations and some trade unions have expressed concern about it.  They have asked for it to be completely rejected because it is so fundamentally flawed that it is beyond saving by amendments on Committee Stage.  That is their opinion and it is mine.<\/p> <p> I am also a bit dismayed by the apparent lack of consultation by Fianna F&aacute;il with the relevant interest groups.  The Deputies may outline in the closing stages of this debate what consultation they had with the NGOs who have called their legislation fundamentally flawed and unworkable.  When any legislation is being drafted or thought of the first port of call should always be those who are most affected by the proposed law, those who campaign daily on the issue and those affected by the issue who need the protection of a Bill such as this.  We should offer them the opportunity to give their opinion on the development of a Bill.  Had this happened the Bill might not have as many glaring deficiencies as it does.  With this Bill Fianna F&aacute;il has created new offences but has given no indication whatsoever of the severity of a sentence for someone convicted of a crime of prejudice.  It is creating a crime without creating a punishment.  The only reference to that is that the judge must take it into account at sentencing but it does not say what the consequences will be.<\/p> <p> I am concerned about how little detail is in the Bill.  There are many jurisdictions around the world that have hate crime laws on their statute books but those laws are very rarely used because they are poorly constructed and unworkable.  If this Bill was to pass in its current state we would become another state that talks the talk about hate crime laws but does not walk the walk.  This is not a road we want to go down.  There is no point in having legislation unless it can be implemented properly and accordingly and it is our belief that this Bill could not function within the context of Ireland&rsquo;s legal system.  I would be the first to let a Bill go to Committee Stage if I thought there was any hope of it being amended but allowing this Bill go forward to Committee Stage would be irresponsible and regressive.  For that reason we cannot in all good conscience support such vague legislation and will vote against it on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400048#VV00200","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475610900,"counter":432,"content":"<p>It is welcome that we are debating hate crime legislation because there is certainly a need for it.  I commend Deputies O&rsquo;Loughlin and Murphy O&rsquo;Mahony for giving us the opportunity to debate it and for drafting legislation.  We also have difficulties with the way it is drafted but we are willing to allow it go through Second Stage.  On the point made by Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien, there is a need for wide consultation with a variety of civil society groups etc. which have been calling for such legislation.  There are pieces and sectors left out of this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  When we were in government the then Minister of State, Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality, investigated the need for hate crime legislation.  Some findings were made and the &ldquo;love not hate&rdquo; campaign started and was supported by many trade unions and civil society groups.  In her contribution Deputy O&rsquo;Loughlin said she would be open to amendments to the legislation and if that was not the case we would not be able to support the Bill because it needs considerable change and expansion.<\/p>  <p>  Hate crimes are horrible crimes motivated by prejudice and there have been some very ugly examples, as outlined by Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien.  We have to change attitudes and the legal response.  That is why it is important to have legislation, particularly given the motivation and the violent and gruesome elements of many of these crimes.  The definitions need to be expanded.  They are not by any means inclusive.  Travellers in particular are not included.  In the equal status and employment equality legislation there are nine grounds for discrimination some of which are not included here, such as ethnicity and the lesbian gay bisexual transgender, LGBT, definitions are not totally inclusive.  If we are to end up with inclusive and workable legislation the Bill needs considerable amendments.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the Scottish legislation but the English and Welsh legislation is a better model.  Sentencing alone will not address the issue, there are more extensive ways of addressing hate crimes in the English and Welsh legislation.  It has to be legislation for ourselves and our country.  We often pride ourselves on progress we have made in a variety of ways but we still have, very sadly, a minority of people who will commit vicious crimes purely on the basis of having a prejudice against a group of people that they do not see as people like themselves.  We need to change that through legislation and in a variety of other ways, such as dealing with bullying in schools and attitudes.  We need to change the way people think but a big and vital element of that is having legislation that is a strong enough deterrent and states clearly that these crimes are not to be tolerated and are to be appropriately punished.  There is a variety of civil society groups which have done a lot of research on this, including the University of Limerick, and we need to draw on all of that for legislation, whether this Bill or the one the Minister is working on but we need it soon. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400050#XX00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1475610900,"counter":433,"content":"<p>We will not support this Bill.  There is absolutely a need for a Bill which addresses hate crime.  There have been attacks on migrants, refugees and people from different religious, racial and ethnic backgrounds and we would welcome a Bill that addresses this problem correctly but unfortunately this Bill is not what we need.<\/p>  <p>  I am not fully equipped to deal with whether this Bill is workable in the Irish legal context but I do know the opinions of Jennifer Schweppe and Amanda Haynes of the Hate and Hostility research group that this is not suitable and we cannot transpose an Act from Scotland to here without running legal risks.<\/p><p>However, I want to concentrate on what is not proposed in the Bill.  The wording on categories at risk from hate crime have been pointed out.  They are outdated, regardless of how well meaning they may be.  For example, the Deputy uses a term in the Bill for trans people.  Is it not possible for the terms to cover Roma, people without documents, refugees or those seeking asylum?  The key to the success of a Bill dealing with hate crime would be to identify the victim groups we are seeking to protect.  On that key issue, this Bill is, to say the least, wanting.  For example, the wording on trans people does not recognise individuals who face hate crime as a result of their being agender or gender fluid, which would be a far better concept to protect people based on their gender identity and gender expression.<\/p> <p> More worrying in an Irish context, and as referred to by other speakers, is that the Bill does not specifically mention Travellers.  That is crucial and I will concentrate on that aspect for the remainder of the time available to me.  Rarely a month goes by when we do not witness prejudice against Travellers in this country.  On many occasions, statements that could encourage discrimination and hate are directed at the Traveller community, often by elected representatives, some in this House and in many county councils up and down the country.  To give some examples, Fianna F&aacute;il Councillor Sean McEniff said on a local radio station in Donegal that one would not want them beside one and that he did not want them beside him.  The councillor made a number of remarks about Traveller families ranging from saying they would wreck houses to branding them as bad eggs.<\/p> <p> Councillor Tom Sheahan referred-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400050#XX00300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475611500,"counter":435,"content":"<p>It is not customary to mention names of those outside the House when they are not here to defend themselves.

Another councillor from Kerry referred to people from outside the county who had relocated in Kerry securing houses over people who had been on the waiting list for a longer time.  He actually mentioned 150 Wards.  He did not mean electoral areas but the family Ward on the county council waiting list.  If those and many other comments were directed at any other group, it would be seen as a clear example of a hate crime or of encouraging a hate crime.<\/p>  <p>  I will quote from a study of Travellers in Britain because we do not have proper studies of hate directed at Travellers here.  The facts and figures are stark.  Nine out of ten gypsy and Traveller children suffered racial abuse and two thirds of children from Traveller groups have been bullied and physically attacked in other communities.  We do not document or record incidents involving Travellers or others here but we know, to paraphrase another, that it is the last acceptable form of racism and it is practised by councillors and Deputies across the country.<\/p>  <p>  While there is a reference in the Bill to race, colour and ethnic origin, it does not recognise Travellers as a distinct ethnic group, despite Travellers campaigning across the country to have their ethnicity recognised.  We still do not do it.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to make a wider point on the limitations in the Bill.  Hate and hostility should be dealt with.  We are in favour of a category of offence that states that where there is an attack, such as a violent or verbal attack on a person that is motivated based on hate of gender, race, ethnicity or other category, it should be recognised and we should say, as a society, that we find those attacks intolerable and they should be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  I have a question for all of us.  What about hate and discrimination when the State is the agent of it?  If we define hate as hostility, prejudice, bias or hatred, I believe this State at all levels, from Government to Departments and down to local authorities, in how it operates and deals with Travellers, has a case to answer.  If hate is not demonstrated in the response of the State to the crisis, for example, in Traveller accommodation, Traveller life expectancy, health outcomes, educational achievements, etc., then I do not know the definition of hate.  To mention a few, the cuts to the Traveller accommodation budget have been appalling.  It went from &euro;40 million in 2008 down to &euro;4 million last year.  That is a 90% cut to Traveller accommodation alone during the period of the recession.  The cuts to Traveller education are in the region of 84% and many of us have seen the impact of that in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the discussion last week on the accommodation crisis in Dundalk, we responded to that and we responded after the fire in Carrickmines last year.  We are not supporting this Bill as an alternative.  There are better worded alternatives coming from people who were involved in the very campaigns and crimes this Bill says it will address.  The Bill fails to address the issues around anti-Traveller sentiment and actions by individuals, the State and its bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400051#YY00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1475611500,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Thomas Pringle.

I am suspicious of the timing of the Bill and wonder if this is the dark side of new politics.  Is it a way to get the European Commission off the Government's back as it investigates Ireland with regard to its obligations under the 2008 Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia?<\/p>  <p>  What is most astonishing is the fact Fianna F&aacute;il did not seem to consult with any of the victims' groups or any representative organisations in regard to the Bill.

In fact, in 2015, the findings of all their research and the heads of a Bill were published, which Fianna F&aacute;il seems to have completely sidestepped and dismissed throughout this whole process.  That 2015 Bill had the support of the working group on hate crime established by the former Labour Party Minister of State, now Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.<\/p>  <p>  According to experts in the field of hate crime, international best practice draws on three key elements which need to be considered in a legislative context.  First, determining which victim groups are to be protected; second, deciding whether the \"hate\" element will be addressed by way of aggravated offences or aggravated sentencing; and, third, determining how \"hate\" will be established and what \"hate\" is understood to mean.  This Bill substantially fails in all three elements.  However, due to time constraints, I will focus on the first element, which is the identification of victim groups that should be afforded protection in legislation.<\/p>  <p>  First, Deputy O'Loughlin failed to reference the most recent statistics on hate crime.  There was mention of CSO figures and that 113 hate crimes were recorded in 2013 but the most up to date figure for 2015, directly obtained by ENAR Ireland&rsquo;s iReport data project, would suggest a much higher figure of 165 crimes.  The report showed the highest rate of assault for a six month period since iReport began in 2013, which is a very worrying trend but not worrying enough for Fianna F&aacute;il to mention.  How can it legislate for an issue if it does not know the true extent of it?<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has also failed to determine the victims' groups.  The Bill refers to transgender identity, which includes transvestism, transsexualism, intersexuality or having changed gender under the Gender Recognition Act 2015.  However, that language is dated and does not represent the full diversity of the trans community.  The correct wording in the Bill should instead reference sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics.  This would be in line with international best practice and provide robust coverage of trans and intersex experiences and identities.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of intersex is positive but it fails to mention agender or gender fluid persons, which fails to afford the protection of individuals on the basis of their gender identity and gender expression.<\/p>  <p>  There is no mention of membership of the Traveller community, which is consistently targeted in hate crime or bias.  It is not good enough to mention ethnicity in the Bill when the Traveller community is not recognised as an ethnic group.  Furthermore, the Roma community, which is very much vulnerable to hate crime or bias, is not mentioned in the Bill.  We only have to recall the murder of Marioara Rostas to remind us of the fact.<\/p>  <p>  It is not clear in the Bill if the mention of disability includes developmental and intellectual disabilities such as autism.  The list goes on.  There is no mention of cisgender identity and it excludes protection of women who are subject to misogynistic hate crime or bias.  There is no reference to religion, belief or lack of, and in the context of rising Islamophobia, it is incredible that was omitted in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also failed to mention residence status, which will leave out protection for those who are targeted because they are refugees or are seeking asylum seeker status.  There is no mention of age, either of elderly people or children targeted by their status.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill fails in its codifying of outdated language, including the term \"hate crime\", although I use it here; in its lack of consultation with interest groups; in not identifying the victims groups who need protection; and in not specifically addressing the groups that are disproportionately targeted in society.<\/p><p>It will serve well to remember what one victim said of hate crime, &ldquo;in theft, you are going for the value of the object [but with hate crime] you are going for the value of the person&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400051#YY00500","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475612100,"counter":440,"content":"<p>In many ways it is unfortunate that Members are discussing something that potentially could have been a positive and constructive proposal but find themselves obliged to concentrate on all the massive glaring omissions and the categories of citizens who deserve legislative protection in this regard and who certainly are not getting it.  I am glad Members have highlighted the issue of hate crime, which I appreciate, but it could have been so much better.  I had the advantage this morning of attending a highly constructive meeting on the harm that will be done regarding the proposed legislation on criminalising the purchase of sex.  I met some Traveller women at that meeting who told me I would be discussing this hate crime Bill in the D&aacute;il tonight.  I replied I did not think so and had not seen such a measure on the schedule because I had not looked at the fine print.  However, they were utterly shocked at the concept of their exclusion from this legislation.  It probably is the most identifiable group in Irish society that needs protection from such a provision and their omission is glaring.  I note that in its press release, Fianna F&aacute;il pointed to the legislation that existed in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England and Wales and how supposedly this legislation would bring us in line with that.  However, those jurisdictions have something we lack, namely, the recognition of Traveller ethnicity and they recognise Travellers as a distinct ethnic group.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill does not give any protection to Travellers and on that basis alone, is severely worrying.  Let us face it, they probably are targeted more than anybody else.  In fairness, Sinn F&eacute;in moved a Private Members' motion that called on the Taoiseach to recognise Traveller ethnicity, which would have committed the D&aacute;il to implementing the recommendations of the April 2014 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the recognition of Traveller ethnicity before the end of the last D&aacute;il term.  That proposal was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il at the time and I do not know why Fianna F&aacute;il did not re-table it now because were it to do so, it would be passed.  That would be something concrete that could really deal with an issue in this regard.  If Members wish to deal with equality, let us put that centre stage because to me, tabling so-called equality legislation that explicitly excludes one of the most discriminated against and vulnerable sections of the community is simply bizarre.  It has the net effect of making a discriminated against minority feel even more discriminated against than they were before Members mentioned this proposal, which I think is ludicrous.<\/p>  <p>  It is appropriate to mention the statistics because there clearly are people present who do not get it.  Travellers on average die 15 years younger than the general population and infant mortality is three times that of the general population.  The female and male death rates are, respectively, three and four times those of the general population.  Fewer than 1% of Travellers progress to third level education.  I refer to the details of four and five-year-old children being put up on the PULSE system - babies in some instances - because of where they came from.  The Travelling community is discriminated against at every turn and is particularly vulnerable to attack.  It is an absolute everyday feature of Traveller life and a Maynooth study from 2010 even reported that 60% of Irish people would not welcome a Traveller as a member of the family.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned the activity of a number of councillors who have played a role in stirring up racism but I put it that the Deputy sitting opposite overtly played a role in stirring up racism towards the Travelling community in opposing Traveller accommodation in her constituency as a waste of valuable resources.  This type of hate-based propaganda put out by individuals to boost their individual profile for electoral purposes or whatever is absolutely abhorrent.  When Members talk about hate crime, let us start in here as well.  Research from Pavee Point shows that 61% of Travellers have experienced discrimination in shops, pubs and restaurants, 62% in schools and 50% in public settings.  Members must take account of this and include it as part of really dealing with hate.  I believe recognising Traveller ethnicity probably would be a more practical way of doing it than this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1475612100,"counter":441,"content":"<p>At the outset, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue and I acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste's presence in the Chamber.  It is ironic that Members are having this debate at all this evening because at the same time, a person is running to be President of America who believes it is okay to insult a massive number of people, that is, those of the Muslim faith.  It beggars belief that in a modern, educated society, a person running for high office like that would think it is all right to target a group of people.  I thought it was awful and wrong.  It shows up some of the problems in society when an educated person like that would make such a statement because the Muslim people who have come to our country have contributed in a great, sound and solid fashion through their work, through having their children here and through being part of our society.  The area from which I come was very fortunate over the past 30 years in particular, in that many people came from all over Europe to live, to work and to raise their children.  I know of one national school not far from where I live that was being attended by young children of 12 or 13 different nationalities.  Every child in that school benefitted from being there because there was such a diversity of cultures, religions and educational backgrounds.  It made for a great place of learning.<\/p>  <p>  To turn to the Bill and what it is trying to achieve, people could be critical of it and could state it is not going far enough.  Whenever one tries to do something, is it not a good thing that one at least is making a start?  We live in an ever-changing world with problems that, because of changes in society, were never experienced in the past and with which our parents or grandparents never had to deal.  One hears of the most awful things in the whole world happening with cyber-crimes and all that sort of thing.  Those issues never existed before because it simply was not an issue.  Legislation must be brought forward and there must be laws to assist people who have a different way of living and to make their lives safer and happier because life is very short for everybody.  Our job as legislators is to try to ensure that people, no matter what type of people they are or what type of gender they are or in what way they wish to lead their lives, who want to live out their lives in a way that is different from what might be called the norm can do so in safety and happiness and free from any type of taunting, bullying or interference.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be supported and the T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Justice and Equality, must be supported in her endeavours to ensure the safety and well-being of all types of people, no matter what their particular persuasions.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the structure of schools and starting off in school.  While they do this, it is extremely important that teachers try to make sure that from an early age, if there are differences in young people they are encouraged to be themselves, whatever that means, and are allowed to flourish and to be educated and that there is zero tolerance of any type of bullying.  Our schools have come on a great deal and their principals and teachers must be commended on what they have done in respect of changes over the past 20 or 30 years because again, they have lived through an awful change in culture and in society in general and have been obliged to deal with the consequences of that within schools.<\/p><p>They must be strict about ensuring that young people, from an early age, learn that one cannot pick on people because of what they are or what they are like, and that one cannot bully people.  Long ago there was no such thing as bullying in the way we know it today.  Bullying can take on all sorts of different manifestations and one can be nasty to a person in underhanded ways, and our teachers and principals must try to watch out for that.  If zero tolerance can start in school, hopefully, students in later life will behave properly and will not interfere with others.<\/p> <p> Coming back to what happens on the Internet, I have grave concerns over the way people can go on the Internet and, using false identities, lure children and twist their minds with unreasonable behaviour.  That is a big worry for parents.  It is also a big worry for grandparents.  Young people, with a telephone inside their pocket, can be subjected to all types of low behaviour by such people who would be out to abuse or mistreat them.<\/p> <p> This raises the issue to a wider platform than what we are debating here, that is, the subject of how will we protect our young people from the dangers of the Internet and social media, which should not be tolerated.  Members of this House have been victims of that type of loutish behaviour.  The funny aspect of it is if one ever goes looking at the profile of those who go on the Internet insulting others one will see that it is done between the hours of 11 o'clock at night and 4 o'clock in the morning.  I will tell the Minister that those people are not getting up at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock the following morning, pulling up their trousers and going out to work.  If they were going to work, they would not be up in the middle of the night insulting everybody, particularly women, and saying offensive things and displaying all that type of behaviour.  They would not be able to be at it, if they were getting up and going out to work.  It is easy for them to be fiddling with their fingers at 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock in the morning, and seeing who will they insult next.  I believe the word for it is \"trolling\", it is something like that.<\/p> <p> We have that big problem to deal with and it merits a lot of debate.  I do not know how it will be legislated for, but I know that it is in everybody's interests, particularly in the interests of impressionable youngsters and teenagers, that they be protected from the dangers and what is completely uncontrolled.  Anybody can go on the Internet.  They can hide with total privacy and lure people, and as I say, subject them to all types of badness.  I would like to see that being addressed.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475612700,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill before this evening and I compliment my two colleagues, Deputies O'Loughlin and Murphy O'Mahony, for bringing it forward.  This Bill essentially seeks to tackle hate crime in an effective and robust manner.  It seeks to ensure that the option is open to the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue a hate crime conviction should such an offence have occurred.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, if somebody is convicted of an offence that is aggravated by prejudice or hatred, then that must be taken into account when sentencing.  Ireland is currently out of step by not having a specific hate crime.  Fianna F&aacute;il firmly believes that such legislation is needed and there is an onus on us to make it clear that such hatred will not be tolerated in society.<\/p>  <p>  I also compliment Deputy Murphy O'Mahony on the Bill as a positive step forward in enhancing and protecting the rights of persons with disability.  It is hoped that the Bill will not only make hate crime based on disability an offence, but will also improve on the reporting and recording of hate crime, which is generally considered under reported.<\/p>  <p>  Hate crime legislation is in place in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales and Fianna F&aacute;il introduced this Bill to bring the legislation up to date.  We are currently working off the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial Religious or National Hatred Act 1989.  Under the Act, it is an offence to incite hatred against a particular group but it does not criminalise those who commit the crimes against the other groups, except under general legislation.  We also must bear in mind how much Ireland has changed since that time.  As the Immigrant Council of Ireland pointed out, it is two decades since immigration into Ireland commenced and it is time for laws to reflect such changes were put in place.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is behind the curve when it comes to having effective legislation in place to deal with hate crimes.  Currently, we do not have specific hate crime laws.  Fianna F&aacute;il firmly believes that such legislation is needed and this will help make it clear.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier I listened to the debate as I went through the House.  I welcome the contributions of the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  We acknowledge the Bill is not perfect.  If we get it to committee we will bring in the NGOs and we will all sit together around the table to make it a far stronger and robust Bill for all sectors of society.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge what Deputy Jonathan O'Brien stated earlier.  The Deputy found so many flaws in it.  I hear what the Deputy is saying, that there is so much left out and he is correct.  The Deputy stated it does not mention the Travelling community, but it does in the sense that people are targeted because of their sexual orientation, gender, including gender identity, race, religion, disability, age and ethnicity, including membership of the Traveller community.  We must acknowledge that this is all about inclusion.  Deputy O'Brien is saying it is a weak Bill and poor legislation.  The Deputy referred to it as lazy legislation, and a regressive Bill.  Surely the Deputy cannot see it as a regressive Bill when there is nothing there beforehand.  It is our first step.  When other groups in the House are acknowledging that it is the right step in the right direction, we must acknowledge that we will never change anything unless we start working together and bring in all groups and ethnic minorities to be part of it.<\/p>  <p>  What is going on in communities is wrong.  It is wrong that individuals are singled out.  It is wrong that the Traveller community is treated so.  It is wrong that Asians and the other groups are singled out.  We must start protecting them and that is what Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and I, and all in this House, are elected to do.  We are elected to be legislators.  We are elected to bring Bills before the House.  We are elected to discuss the Bill but then we also have a duty to bring them to committee to bring in all those who we represent around the table to discuss how we can strengthen the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  There is no point in bringing Bills before the House unless we are prepared to see them through.  Sometimes it is so easy to find fault with everything but it is far more constructive to work as a unit to represent the people Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and I represent.  All of us who represent the people come from the various groups this seeks to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400053#AAA00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1475612700,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I agree completely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400053#AAA00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1475612700,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400053#AAA00400","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1475612700,"counter":446,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, Fianna F&aacute;il did not do that when it was in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400053#AAA00500","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1475612700,"counter":447,"content":"<p>With respect-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400053#AAA00600","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1475612700,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Deputy Rabbitte without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400053#AAA00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1475612700,"counter":449,"content":"<p>-----what I am trying to say is the Bill that the Deputies have brought before the House is a positive step in the right direction of addressing hate crime.

I thank Deputies Margaret Murphy O'Mahony and Fiona O'Loughlin for bringing forward this Bill.  It is important that we are having this debate today and I appreciate all the contributions made.  Like the T&aacute;naiste, I have issues with certain aspects of this Bill but overall I support the rationale and premise behind it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is firmly committed to combating and challenging all manifestations of prejudice - racism, homophobia, sexism or religious discrimination.  Being the target of a crime for simply being who one is or for being perceived as different is completely unacceptable and must not be tolerated.<\/p>  <p>  Irish society is changing and evolving into a diverse society every day.  We need to ensure, where necessary, that we respect and protect all members and all vulnerable groups from any type of discrimination and particularly from hate crime.  We have made great strides.  We have looked after the LGBT people but we still have much work to do to ensure all sectors of society are protected from all types of irrational hatred and violence.<\/p>  <p>  All crime has an impact on victims, particularly hate-motivated crimes and it does not impact only on the victim but on all members of that particular group.  It feeds feelings of rejection, loneliness and isolation and, in turn, that prompts reactions of alienation and counter-responses, and the cycle continues.  We must bring our understanding and solidarity to these people.  This is essential if we are to live together in diverse groups in our society as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  A review of our approach to the integration of migrants, which was launched in 2014, provides the basis for a new and updated migrant integration strategy, which will be published soon.  This will include a strong anti-racism component, with specific areas for action to promote intercultural awareness and to combat racism and xenophobia.<\/p>  <p>  Hate crime and less serious levels of public harassment and insult, if not tackled adequately, reduce the safety of public spaces by creating an impression of impunity and public support for these crimes.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned some very heinous crimes.  We are all aware of these in society and they can be very significant.  Violent prejudice attacks the very cohesion and fabric of our society.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that there is an ongoing review of Ireland's Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 and this is being done in light of reports by civil society, international obligations and changes in society, including the use of the Internet and social media.  The wider issue of hate-based crime is also forming part of this review.  The provisions of this Bill and this debate will also feed into this work.  Having said that, I reiterate what the T&aacute;naiste said earlier.  It is a fact that the courts can and do take into account bias or prejudice motivation as an aggravating factor when it comes to sentencing.  I share the T&aacute;naiste's concerns as to how some of these provisions would work in a practical sense, such as how the aggravation of the offence would be proved in court?  I believe this will be difficult to demonstrate in practice.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, as mentioned by other speakers, where we are legislating for certain bias motivation, as this Bill does, I believe consideration should be given at a minimum to including prejudice based on religious intolerance, gender or members of the Travelling community, as mentioned by many speakers.  These are all groups protected under the Prohibition against Incitement to Hatred Act.<\/p>  <p>  Last November An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na extended recording of bias motivation indicators for hate-motivated incidents on the Garda PULSE system to include anti-Traveller and anti-Roma as well as anti-Muslim, transphobia, age related, gender related and disability related motivation indicators.  These, in addition to the existing bias motivation indicators, which are anti-Semitism, homophobia, racism, sectarianism and xenophobia, will enable more comprehensive collection of data when recording incidents, and this is very important.  This more detailed recording will also form part of the victim assessment in accordance with the EU victims directive.<\/p>  <p>  There is very much an awareness on the Government's part of the seriousness and the impact of hate crime and this debate reflects that awareness, although it must be said that the T&aacute;naiste has expressed concerns about the import of this proposed Bill and she outlined her concerns about aspects of it, its effectiveness and the amendments it may require, and I share those views.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for bringing forward this Bill and I know they will be anxious to consider how best to address the policy and drafting issues raised in this debate, as another Deputy opposite said, as this Bill moves forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400054#BBB00100","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1475613300,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Ultimately, the reason we brought forward this Bill is to do with the type of society we live in.

Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony and I are coming with open hands to say we want to hear what Members have to say.  We have done service to the D&aacute;il and to the people we represent by starting this discussion.  I apologise for leaving certain minorities out.  It was not what we intended to do.  I have a list of amendments here that I wish to table so I hope Members of the House will see the Bill is worthy of going to Committee Stage.  We will be able to debate it further and bring in the other NGOs with which I have already started to engage at a higher level.  I look forward to that opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400054#BBB00600","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1475613900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1475613900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 6 October 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400055#CCC00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1475613900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.35 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 5 October 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
