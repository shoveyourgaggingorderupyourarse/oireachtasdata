Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to this constitutional requirement. <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin our public engagement, we considered the minutes of our meetings of 11 and 16 February at our private meeting last week. Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes are agreed in public session.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.<\/p> <p>  Today we engage with officials from the Office of Government Procurement to examine the 2019 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. David Moloney, acting Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement, and Mr. David O&rsquo;Brien, principal officer, Office of Government Procurement.  I welcome them to the meeting and thank them and their staff for the briefing material they prepared for the committee.<\/p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing to avoid background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the button to raise their hand when they wish to contribute and then put it down.  I also remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. <\/p> <p>  Before starting, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference you may make to other person in your evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses should also be aware of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. <\/p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.      <\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that Members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I would ask the witness to state their name the first time they contribute.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614690000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>As members are aware, procurement of goods and services by public bodies is a highly complex process that can be challenging from both a technical and legal point of view.  Public procurement covers a vast range of goods and services from administrative supplies such as stationery and paper through to large scale and complex projects in areas such as information technology, capital works and the purchase of drugs.<\/p> <p>  A sustained focus on public procurement over the past number of years, both by my office and by the Committee of Public Accounts, has driven a significant improvement in public procurement practice across the whole public sector.  As a matter of policy, I have drawn attention to any situation in an audited body where we identified procurement of goods and services that was not compliant with relevant national and EU rules, and where the aggregate value of the spending was in excess of &euro;500,000 in a year.  The committee has followed up on such cases, seeking additional explanations, and clear outlines of plans to address the problem.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responded to recommendations made.  As a result, we have seen improvements such as improved tracking by many public bodies of their procurement, including identifying cases where procedures followed were not competitive and-or not compliant; and more transparency by public bodies in their annual financial statements about situations where there has been significant non-compliant procurement, and the reasons for that.  With the exception of the health service, there has been a downward trend in the level of non-compliant procurement requiring disclosure in the accounts of public sector bodies subject to audit by me.<\/p> <p>  Competitive and open procurement is generally considered to be the best way to ensure that a public body has secured good value for money spent.  It should also allow legitimate suppliers who are interested in the business opportunity to submit bids for consideration, and to have those bids evaluated in an equitable and fair way.  Public bodies need to take a strategic approach to their procurement activity to ensure these benefits are achieved.  Competitive procurement needs to be followed up by careful contract agreement and effective contract management.  <\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that some procurements carried out without a competitive process can still be considered compliant with procurement rules.  Within the existing procurement rules, there are a number of types of circumstances where purchasing may take place without a competitive process.  Examples of such purchases include where only a single supplier providing a required service can be identified; the purchase of proprietary or branded goods; where there is a genuine urgency; or where there are specific security considerations.  Public bodies availing of such options need to be able to demonstrate that it is appropriate to do so, and that good value for money has nevertheless been achieved.<\/p> <p>  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, was established as a separate Vote in 2014.  It was created through a merger of units that previously existed in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in the Office of Public Works.  The OGP has responsibility for service-wide procurement policy and procedures, sourcing systems and data analytics.  It also seeks to put in place shared framework agreements and contracts for the purchase of goods and services by public sector bodies.  The OGP aims to provide information and support to public sector bodies through account managers and help desk staff.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement records gross expenditure of &euro;16.1 million.  This represented a small increase, of around 4%, on the prior year outturn.  The expenditure was incurred on a single programme, with the bulk of the spending accounted for by salaries and other pay costs.  The OGP had a surplus to surrender of &euro;2.4 million at the end of 2019.  The underspend fell into two areas: pay, with an underspend of &euro;2 million or 13%; and procurement consultancy and other costs with an underspend of &euro;589,000 or 24%.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account for 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1614690000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Before Mr. Moloney gives his opening statement, unfortunately I must limit him to five minutes.

The statement is lengthy and I will try to skip through it.  If members have questions on the parts that I skip, I am happy to take them.<\/p> <p>  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, is a division of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that has at its core the management of public expenditure at sustainable levels and responsible and responsive public management and governance.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, &euro;2.4 million of the &euro;18.4 million allocation from the Exchequer was surrendered at the end of the year but this was mostly due to delays in recruiting staff and longer than expected start-up times in a number of key projects.<\/p> <p>  The programme for procurement reform commenced in 2013 and since then, great progress has been made.  The OGP works with sector partners in health, local government, education and defence to source goods and services that are common throughout public service, such as ICT, professional services and cleaning.  The sector partners themselves source sector specific goods and services.  We estimate that &euro;6 billion of procurement addressable spend falls within the remit of the OGP and other central purchasing bodies.  While the OGP is charged with developing the policy framework and associated guidelines, it is up to the contracting authorities to ensure they adhere to these rules.  The OGP does not have a policing role in compliance and nor does it have the remit to review individual public procurement processes.<\/p> <p>  The procurement arrangements put in place by the OGP cover a broad range of services and it helps its clients with complex legal arrangements under the European procurement regime.  At the same time, these arrangements drive real value for money for citizens, not only delivering savings that can be reinvested in the delivery of front-line services but also supporting sustained participation by small and medium-sized enterprises.  The OGP provided advice to the public sector on Brexit and issued information notes highlighting the various steps public bodies could take to prepare for the impact of Brexit, including a focus on tender documentation, contract management and contingency planning.  The OGP also has responsibility for providing policy guidance to the construction sector under the capital works management framework, which consists of a comprehensive suite of guidance and template documents implementing Government reforms in construction procurement.<\/p> <p>  The impact of Covid-19 on the national development plan has been significant and the OGP has provided guidance to public bodies in managing the contractual issues arising and determining how to manage tender competitions under way.  These steps have helped public bodies and the industry to respond well to the new working environment, particularly in protecting infrastructure projects under the national development plan.  A review of the capital works management framework is under way and a key focus for the construction industry in 2021 will be on improving productivity.<\/p> <p>  Ensuring SMEs can successfully compete for public contracts is critical in public procurement.  In this context, the OGP also supports the Minister of State in his quarterly meetings with the SME advisory group and works to address the concerns of industry bodies.  The OGP gathers comprehensive information on procurement spending and tendering throughout the public service, which shows that 53% of spend in 2018 was directly with SMEs and that 92% of spend was with firms based in Ireland with a median tender size of &euro;100,000.<\/p> <p>  The operational work of the OGP is focused on establishing and servicing procurement solutions, such as overarching framework agreements and commercial solutions for all public bodies as well as the procurement of bespoke goods and services for individual clients.  Framework agreements operate by aggregating demand from the whole of the public service and are established through open competitive processes.  In this way, they offer the potential to realise significant efficiencies.  Framework agreements are often broken down by lots into geography, specialism or contract size to encourage SME participation at local level.  In the years since 2014, frameworks and contracts put in place by the OGP and its sectoral sourcing partners have already enabled savings estimated at &euro;570 million for the State.  At present, the OGP has more than 121 framework agreements in place and in 2019 it completed more than 1,000 competitions.  The work of the OGP touches on many aspects of citizens' lives.  It covers a broad range of issues, such as contracts for electric vehicles, a framework for legal services, electricity framework agreements, a framework for robotic process automation and arrangements for rapid build housing.<\/p> <p>  The HSE has been very active in contributing to the national response to Covid.  The OGP has liaised with the HSE, utilising its personal protective equipment supply lines and securing equipment for non-health front-line public sector workers.  A team was established to support the establishment of emergency site facilities with the HSE.  The OGP, with others, launched a web page to capture offers of assistance and equipment from businesses and other organisations seeking to provide supplies and services in support of the national response to Covid.  A number of OGP staff volunteered-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1614690000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Moloney to take a minute to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#B00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614690000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The chief procurement officer is now on the high-level task force.<\/p> <p>  The OGP has taken initiatives to try to create greater understanding of procurement throughout the public service and the commercial skills academy forms a very important part of this.

As part of the programme for Government, the OGP will continue to find innovative ways to incorporate green and social considerations in its procurement solutions.  Working with its clients, the OGP will continue to provide a broad suite of solutions to procurement issues.<\/p> <p>  Promoting better planning, earlier engagement and robust post-award contract management will mean the State is better equipped to deliver real value for Government spending, not only ensuring there are cash savings through the arrangements put in place but also that public sector buyers access the right goods and services at the right time and that rigorous quality assurance is in place.

When we faced into the pandemic urgent decisions had to be taken on products such as personal protective equipment. PPE.  Is there a mechanism for dealing with this?  The tendering process takes a bit of time.  With regard to personal protective equipment, ventilators and medication, was a process in place to deal with the urgency?  Did we get all of what we required?  Did the hospital services get all of the equipment they required in a timely manner?

It is a basic principle of public procurement that competitive tendering should be used except in justifiably exceptional circumstances.  Notwithstanding this, the procurement rules do provide flexibility to contracting authorities in times of extreme urgency arising from events that are unforeseeable by the contracting authority.  Of course, the Covid pandemic is an example of such an unforeseeable event.  The OGP has been very involved in helping and advising the various contracting authorities on this and has issued notes and guidance on it.  Of course, the use and justification for non-competitive procurement is a matter for each contracting authority to decide.  For example, the health sector would decide how to implement it within the health sector but the OGP is available to all public bodies to offer advice.  Any time non-standard procurement is used it is notified.  Contracts valued at more than &euro;25,000 are notified to the Comptroller and Auditor General and published in the appropriation accounts of the bodies concerned.<\/p> <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, we have been very involved in working with HSE and others in trying to address the issues the Deputy has raised.

In terms of lessons learned, what was very important during this period was the speed with which the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and the health system acted.  It is coming up on a year since the OGP issued guidance to all the public service bodies regarding the flexibilities it had within the procurement laws and the procurement directives.  What that allowed was for public bodies to move ahead under the situation that people found themselves in of extreme and unforeseeable urgency to produce that which they needed to do.  It extended not only into the health service but beyond that to other bodies like the Garda, the prison services, direct provision centres and eventually into education.  People needed to do things to enable the services to citizens to continue.  We issued guidance almost a year ago, literally within days of the start of the pandemic on 22 March.  That supported people in doing that which they needed to do.  About a week later the European Commission followed up with a similar piece of guidance that supported people in doing what they needed to do.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question about what we learned is an important one.  I would draw attention to a couple of things.  These are lessons we have shared with the OECD and the European Commission.  Importantly, the structures we established under the reform guise helped enormously in the entire system pulling together.  It enabled my office at the centre, working with players like health, education and local government, to procure that which was needed and to leverage arrangements that were required.  In particular, the health system moved ahead very quickly, as we know, to procure personal protective equipment, PPE.  My office worked across the remainder of the public service to consolidate their needs and we were able to leverage off those arrangements with the health system to ensure people like the Prison Service, direct provision centres, etc. were able to get that which they needed very quickly.<\/p> <p>  We played a huge role not only in providing advice but also providing a mechanism for co-ordination.  It is a similar story across other countries internationally but Ireland's scale and the fact we had established these arrangements for co-operation and collaboration under the reform banner paid dividends during that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1614690000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>On Brexit and the effect it has had on the tendering process, what difference has that made with regard to contracts?

The trade and co-operation agreement under Title VI deals with public procurement specifically and goes somewhat beyond the Government procurement under the World Trade Organization rules.  We do not anticipate substantial issues arising with regard to procurement rules <i>per se<\/i>, but the challenges in terms of the regulatory environment, the customs environment and rules of origin are already creating issues that are quite perceivable for anybody who does their shopping in any of the UK multiples or sees products coming through there.  We see the wrinkles in terms of those arrangements actually starting to arise.  They will arise for Government too in terms of challenges in customs declarations and ensuring people are aware of the delays that can occur now at ports.<br\/><br\/>We have seen some issues, especially on the construction side where, because of some of the challenges, we have seen a slowdown in certain materials that travel either from or through the UK.  They are likely to result potentially in increased costs as well as potential delays in terms of slowdowns.  Those costs will probably arise from the administration of the customs arrangements more so than anything arising because of tariffs or duties because there is a free trade element to the trade and co-operation agreement.  Rules of origin also apply which look into the materials and their origin that flow from the UK.  Putting a badge &quot;Made in the UK&quot; or &quot;Made in the EU&quot; requires the fulfilling of certain rules of origin, which means where do all the component parts come from and is it genuinely either a UK product or an EU product?  Some of those technicalities are starting to create challenges, ultimately, from a regulatory, customs and rules of origin perspective.  Beyond that they are trade issues rather than public procurement matters.

In terms of the policing or auditing of contracts, the Comptroller and Auditor General has responsibility for that.  Indeed, as is clear from his opening statement, his office takes that responsibility very seriously and brings issues arising to the attention of the Accounting Officers, in terms of commentary on the appropriation accounts, and to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In a sense, that oversight aspect is delivered in that way.  In terms of systematic issues that come up and that need to be addressed in the context of the general public procurement guidelines and how they might be improved, we maintain an awareness of issues that arise and seek to strengthen and improve our guidelines as those issues come into view.

A few things have moved on since 2013.  Since that period, the expenditure profile has changed somewhat.  While I do not have the details of what the Deputy has in front of her, if I recall it correctly, we made a distinction between the overall procurement spend of public bodies and what we call the addressable spend.  The difference between the two relates to a number of things we exclude because they would be excluded under public procurement, including, for example, inter-agency expenditure.  For example, some bodies would count in their non-pay expenditure moneys they grant or pass on to other public service bodies.  The system pushes money out from the centre through a grant system and a lot of that would not be procurable.  Other things that would not be procurable would include, in the standard fashion, rent and rates.  Again, they are not included.  A large sum that we also excluded was money reimbursed for pharmaceuticals through the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, which accounts for approximately &euro;1.1 billion or &euro;1.2 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#D01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1614690000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I understand the difference.

There is a proportion of savings one will get from that and then perhaps there is an additional proportion of savings to be had just by capturing a better value for money than had previously been the case.  Is it the case that Mr. Quinn expects that amount of &euro;570 million to remain approximately static?

There is an early win for procurement aggregation, is how I would put it.  That arises by looking at the holistic needs of the entire public sector and ensuring that, for example, the price a small school out on the Aran Islands is paying for its electricity is the same as what we can procure it for say, the Revenue Commissioners.  Part of what the OGP has been able to do in enabling its savings has been to ensure things like that do happen.  We look at the needs of the entire public sector, from small bodies to large ones and ensure we get those benefits from aggregation.  That has to be balanced then with the reality that we cannot over-aggregate-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1614690000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#E00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614690000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>-----business either.  We have to look at ensuring small businesses also have an opportunity so while we aggregate, we then disaggregate into lots and we allow lotting to happen to find the right kind of balance between those things.  What it does do is it enables small bodies, typically, to benefit from the buying power of larger public bodies and that is where a lot of that happens.  It does also become cyclical in that during better economic times, it is more difficult to deliver incremental savings and during tougher economic times, one generally finds markets are hungrier.  It does become somewhat baked into the base and our savings numbers probably peaked in the early years.  When I look at a breakdown year by year, which we will provided separately as the Deputy has requested, in 2016 and 2017 when the office got up and running at scale and we were delivering a lot of new frameworks for the public sector that people were buying into, we delivered a lot more in savings than we have done over the past number of years.<\/p> <p>  There are a lot of other benefits that accrue from the centralisation of public procurement other than simply saving money.  It is part of the picture but it also enables things like secondary policies like green and social to be implemented.  It give a far more credible offering out there to the markets that we know what we are about, that we are dealing with things in a much more professional way and it delivers a lot of administration savings because, as the Secretary General said earlier, all these individual public bodies were off doing their own thing - excuse the expression - whereas now, not only the OGP but our partners in the health system, in local government, in defence and education are procuring on behalf of the entire system and that reduces a lot of administration costs as well, which are available to public bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1614690000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>We have gone over time.

We have been aware for six or seven months that vaccination centres would be needed and a number of organisations did offer their premises for use as vaccination centres.  In England and other countries, churches, cathedrals and various locations have been used as centres but not so in this country and these places were offered for use free of charge or just to cover costs.  Mr, Moloney has confirmed that his body has a seat on the high-level body that deals with this matter.  For example, the Protestant churches offered their venues.  Why was this offer not availed of?  There has been talk that these venues might not be suitable and hygiene has been mentioned.  Some community facilities would be of the same standard or maybe higher than some of the hotels and so on that are being used.  I want a straight answer as to why community and church facilities were not availed of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030200002#L00100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614690000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>In the first instance, this is a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health.

I understand that the Pfizer vaccine must be stored below minus 70&deg; Celsius but it is being brought to centres that do not have a cold storage facility and used within a few hours.  All of the other vaccines can be used at the typical kitchen fridge temperature, so a standard fridge will be used to store them.  I do not see the complexity.  I have seen some of these venues that are being used and the cubicles being constructed.  They could be constructed in five or six halls, within a stone's throw of the house where I live in Portlaoise, that are not being used and it is the same in County Offaly and other counties.  Many venues have been offered and are available.  For example, school halls have been available, community facilities that are closed up and churches.  We have not heard a credible explanation from anybody to date.  Mr. Moloney mentioned the complexity but I do not see the matter as being that complex.  Without trying to simplify things, if a venue is large enough, has parking facilities, and all of these places have huge parking facilities, and one can store the vaccine then I cannot see why the very same cubicles cannot be put in the same as they were in Cork City Hall.<\/p> <p>  I want to discuss the nature of the contract and two tenders for the national children's hospital, which have caused a lot of problems.

I take no pleasure from saying the following.  I am more concerned since the day of that meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts than beforehand in terms of what is happening with the hospital.

As a public representative, workers who are working on small and large projects that are part of Government or State contracts have complained to me that they are not receiving the proper rate for the job and do not get an overtime payment or proper holiday pay.  Some of these workers are on bogus self-employment even though they are employers or employees.  They have asked me why has all of this has happened when it is a public contract.  Have we been weak in terms of doing that?  Have we less control in terms of putting in the workers' rights element?  For example, the need for more apprenticeships, ensuring that they are targeted at disadvantaged groups, ensuring that the rate for the job is paid in terms of the established trade rates, ensuring that there is proper holiday pay and ensuring that there is no bogus self-employment.  What is the situation?  Why is this going on?

It was the best that could be done in the circumstances and ten out of ten to everybody involved.  Is there a mechanism whereby we can try to retain the native suppliers and encourage this?

I welcome the witnesses.  I had a Zoom meeting with Bord na M&oacute;na one week ago.  There are concerns around the country about drains that have been deepened and pumps are operating, boundary or mairning drains between farmers and drains that go through land to a river.  There are places near Ballinasloe where this is happening.  The meeting was constructive but constructive is one thing and having something down the road is another.<\/p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na said it would consult and liaise with farmers and do all the usual that everyone says they will do.  I have no reason to doubt it but I proposed the farming organisations meet Bord na M&oacute;na.  It needs to be done, even if we get an independent chairperson.  It needs to be put down on paper because, as we are all aware, there have been too many times when verbal agreements were gone back on ten years later.<\/p> <p>  Once the rewetting is done, it will not be coming right up to a mairning.  I have talked to an ecologist about it.  There is rewetting done in areas near me and  I understand how it operates.  However, we need a written agreement between the parties to make sure there is no ambiguity or doubt in ten or 15 years' time.  Once a bog is rewetted, people will not go back to look around except perhaps for some pairing.  A commitment is needed to maintain the mairning or boundary drains between farmers and to keep pumps in place, where required.  Those are the two biggest dangers.  <\/p> <p>  There is a large amount of marginal land in counties Roscommon, Longford and Galway and the midlands counties that farmers are trying to make a living off.  They would not be able to farm it if the drains were not cleaned.  Milled peat has blocked some of the main rivers such the Little Brosna, which I travelled in the time of the Shannon.  These issues need to be rectified in black and white.  While everyone can smile at each other at a Zoom meeting, at the end of the day, farmers will suffer the consequences in five, ten or 15 years' time when we are no longer in politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#C00200","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  The report by the IFA referred to the threat of flooding to adjacent land and the water table at local level.  It stated these would present a risk to health and safety and farm machinery and asked the working group to keep local farmers informed.  Lack of communication with the stakeholders is a thread that seems to run through every committee meeting with the Department.  It comes across in the three earlier reports.  What is the level of engagement between the witnesses, Bord na M&oacute;na and the stakeholders regarding turbary rights?  Will the witnesses outline their concerns about future ownership and their concerns, similar to the NARGC about using the land to offset carbon emissions with storage of carbon in bogs?<\/p> <p>  The ICMSA report stated that peatland rehabilitation guidelines should be published and its impact on local roads addressed.  Is enough thought being given to alternative ways of rehabilitating these bogs?  Is the prospect of rewetting near farmlands having an impact on farmers' ability to sell their land and the price of their land?  <\/p> <p>  On the NARGC report, we are all aware that a one-dimensional, one-size-fits-all approach does not work and will not work in this case.  Different bogs will need different rehabilitation measures.  Has the work carried out at the bogs over the decades changed the local water table or the capacity of the bogs to hold water?  If so, is enough attention being paid to this?  Under the current plans, could some areas go from lake to desert and back again with flooding?

I thank Senator Boyhan for his comments on our submission.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice is right.  This is a major challenge for all of us.  It is a substantial change with up to 33,000 ha or up to 80 sites being rewetted by Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is obviously a massive challenge.  We have had considerable engagement with Bord na M&oacute;na.  We are coming out of the year we had last year and are still in the pandemic.  We need engagement with farmers and the only we can do that is on a Zoom call.  Bord na M&oacute;na's first mistake was taking on this major operation in the middle of a pandemic.  It is a major change but so be it.<\/p> <p>  I share Deputy Fitzmaurice's concerns around drains and how drainage will be maintained.  It is one thing getting this operation up and running but we must ensure that proper maintenance will be ongoing in this area.  On the proposal we have from Bord na M&oacute;na, our engagement goes back to that of our deputy president, Mr. Brian Rush, who is on the line.  He engaged with farmers as far back as last summer, on the sites, in the Offaly area in particular.  We had a meeting with the CEO of Bord na M&oacute;na and his staff late last year and we formed a working group out of that.  Our people are participating in it with Bord na M&oacute;na staff.  <\/p> <p>  Drainage is a major concern.  Bord na M&oacute;na has proposed an external drain around the perimeter of the bog, which will drain into the rivers in the area.  As our submission states, we want a hydrological assessment to be done of lands in that area.  If lands are impacted, farmers will have to be compensated in those areas.  Deputy Browne made a point on the threat of flooding.  Of course there is a threat.  If this work is done, there will have to be ongoing remedial work done.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Browne also asked about turbary rights.  We have already raised that issue with Bord na M&oacute;na.  Farmers who have been harvesting turf in the area for years have to be protected as well.<\/p> <p>  I make a final point on carbon storage.  Bord na M&oacute;na has stated that anything up to 100 million tonnes of carbon can be sequestered in these bogs.  That is important for the country.  We are all part of a climate debate and we, as farmers, are part of that.  We are the only sector that can be part of the solution.<\/p><p>By that I mean in particular farmers' lands that adjoin Bord na M&oacute;na lands.  Bord na M&oacute;na is now setting up equipment to measure the carbon being sequestered in its bogs.  It would be important also to look at the carbon that is being sequestered in farmers' lands in those regions.  It could help the community and it would be another income farmers in that area could derive.  The working group is looking at that with Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Will the farming organisations be pushing for a written agreement for the future?

The movement to the stewardship of somebody else is critical.  The Deputy is perfectly right.  Time and again we have seen agreements and everybody smiles, shakes hands and walks away, but we need to have this in writing for the generations of farm families to come who potentially will be affected.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Martin Browne, obviously we need to establish a scientific basis for the rewetting.  We need a scientific and independent judgment on adjoining farms pre rewetting and potentially post rewetting.  Those of us who are from rural areas and involved in farming understand the significant difference between having a flow and not having a flow.  That is talking very much in layman's terms.  There can be major consequences associated with rewetting, which can potentially be seen from miles around in extreme circumstances.<\/p> <p>  It is important to get a commitment in writing.

We made a lengthy submission to the committee.  Our concern is that the bogs need to go back to the way that they were or as close to the way they were as possible.  We had a meeting with Bord na M&oacute;na about three weeks ago.  We do not envisage it happening with the plans it has.  It is focusing on rewetting, which basically will not cut the mustard with this because these bogs have no seed base and they need to be replanted.  We sent the committee a report by someone in the UK who did some of this kind of work.<\/p> <p>  We believe the bogs need to be gradually re-wetted.  In tandem with that they must be recolonised with the right bog plants.  By the right bog plants, I mean the small bog plants, heather, grasses, lichens and sphagnum moss.  We do not want them to turn into birch plantations or lakes.  To store and take in carbon needs plants on the bog.  That is where we are coming from.  We are concerned about what is going on because a bog needs to have very little variation in its water level throughout the year.  With rewetting unfortunately, the level could go down to about 3 ft or 4 ft, which will not cut the mustard for plants because those plants need to be in water for the whole year.<\/p> <p>  We envisage a lot of problems.  There was a lack of engagement on this, as we also pointed out in our submission.  We hope that will change and they will look at it all.  Simply going in and rewetting bogs will not work and could cause serious problems, as outlined by the farming people.  I will not take up any more of the committee's time because I am sure other people want to come in.  That is where we are coming from.<\/p> <p>  The proper plants need to get back on the bogs for the purposes of carbon and for pollination.  Heather is the best pollinator plant in the country.  A third reason is that the preferred habitat for many of the vulnerable species, such as the curlew, the red grouse and practically all the ground nesting birds, is open moor and bog.  Unfortunately, not much of that is left.  Many birch plantations are left but not good open moorland and it needs to go back to that as much as possible.  We appreciate that it might not be possible to do that in every bog but the aim should be at least to try to go back to that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Curley"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I will be very brief because we have many contributors and time is limited.  I have attended meetings and discussed this issue with neighbours.  Where I live is right on the verge of certain areas that will be badly affected.  I ask the representatives to update us on where they are.  Has anything in their communications with Bord na M&oacute;na changed since they made their submissions?  We will be meeting representatives of the board later and I will emphasise this.  I am reasonably familiar with the pros and cons of this and I am looking forward to the interaction with Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p> <p>  In the deliberations with the board, has it been mentioned, for example, that someone with a small portion of land, maybe a bit of lowland, nearing a bog could be compensated and allow it to be included in the rewetting project?  If the price was right, for want of a better phrase, he might be prepared to walk away from that, rather than having to go to the cost of putting in a drain for him or whatever.

In reference to the IFA's engagement, as the president said, I travelled to west Offaly last summer to meet farmers on the ground.  I live in north-west Kildare on the Offaly border and I am sandwiched between two bogs that have been marked for rewetting.  I have land that could be damaged by this so I understand the issue and farmers' concerns.  We had an online meeting a few weeks ago with 200 farmers and landowners, and we put together 50 questions, which we have since put to Bord na M&oacute;na.  We are expecting an answer to those questions at the end of this month.  I agree with the point that the pumps need to continue to run.  This issue formed part of our questions as well as issues regarding maintenance of outflows and of drains going through Bord na M&oacute;na land that neighbouring land is reliant on for drainage.  It is critical that this remains in place.<\/p> <p>  I want to emphasise another point on the issue of ownership.  On the rewetting project, Bord na M&oacute;na will store and sequester thousands of tonnes of carbon.  That carbon will have a value and will continue to have a value in the future.  There is a concern that if this becomes a massive carbon sink then that carbon could be traded.  It is our view, and the view of farmers, that if there is value stored in the carbon on Bord na M&oacute;na land and surrounding land, it must benefit the local communities in which it is situated.  That is an absolute red line issue.  No one objects to the project Bord na M&oacute;na is working on but we are concerned as to the speed and pace it expects to complete it by, and its level of engagement.  If there is value in the carbon sequestered in bogs in the future, it has to benefit the local community.<\/p> <p>  There is a concern that if Bord na M&oacute;na leaves these bogs in the future, they could come under the remit of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and this could result in designations.  All of us on this committee know what has happened to farmers' land that has been designated.  There is a severe economic impact on their land.  We do not want this issue to become a back door to land designations.  We have been clear on this point.  Another of the key points, which we were very clear about to Bord na M&oacute;na, is that it is its responsibility to communicate this project to the local communities.  We have pushed them hard on that.  We had a number of locally elected officials at our online meeting and they made this point as well.  We will continue to make this point to Bord na M&oacute;na.  When members speak to the company's representatives, one of the key issues they need to be pushed on is that they must engage fully and completely with local communities.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Daly's question about the answers we have received so far, we have submitted questions and we expect to have another meeting of our working group between the end of this month and the beginning of the next.  We expect to receive those answers at that time.  As the president stated, we met with Bord na M&oacute;na officials in person before Christmas and that was a good initial meeting where we got to raise our concerns.  Obviously, the stakes are higher now and we will push them for more answers.<\/p> <p>  We are very careful on the issue of compensation.  As was mentioned earlier, we need to make sure Bord na M&oacute;na remains in these areas to maintain and look after drains.  There is a worry that if farmers look for compensation at this stage, this would provide Bord na M&oacute;na with the opportunity to exit the affected areas.  Speaking honestly, when the issue of compensation comes up during the online meetings, it is not entertained.  The ideal scenario is that Bord na M&oacute;na remains in the communities and that liaison officers are there to maintain and make sure outflows continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Rushe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I would like to comment on stakeholder engagement which has been spoken about.  Our organisation put forward the suggestion, which I want the committee to take on board, that each bog due to be rehabilitated should have a local committee with all stakeholders involved because there is no better place to start and to gain knowledge than at local level.  With the greatest respect to ecologists, scientist and all the reports about rehabilitation from Bord na M&oacute;na, which I have read most of, we are concerned on a number of front, one of which is local engagement.  We want to see good local engagement set up, not just a couple of phone calls or Zoom meetings.  We want to see a local committee that recognises and feeds in to a committee such as this one or a national oversight body.  Each bog that is taken out of production and is rehabilitated should have a local committee, which includes all stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  The second issue that concerns us is the long-term plan.  I have read a number of the proposed draft plans and I accept that they are very good and much work and scientific research has gone into them.  The long-term plan seems to be for the duration of the integrated pollution control, IPC, licence.  As soon as the licence is surrendered, what happens after that and who looks after it?  These bogs will need oversight and people to look after them, and they will need work done on them.  Especially when the rehabilitation starts, hopefully we will see new forms of wildlife coming back to the bog.  We need to have a proper management structure in place.<\/p> <p>  What worries me a small bit is that over the past few years we have had a number of different committees, surveys and bodies and funding coming from different places towards the bogs.  Do not get me wrong, that is all very good.  I like money being directed towards the bogs but is there joined-up thinking on this?  Do we know exactly what is happening to all the bogs around the country?  Are there too many Indians here and maybe not one chief?  Who is doing the oversight on the rehabilitation work done to date?  We know there have been test sites done.  We know there have been test places taken.  I have seen one or two instances where drains have been blocked.<\/p> <p>  The lack of an overall plan worries me slightly.  We do not want to see a situation like that involving the person Mr. Curley alluded to earlier.  This person has done tremendous work on bog rehabilitation in England.  His suggestion, which we have included in our submission, is that 90% of the money should be spent on the ground and 10% spent on administration and paperwork.  Is there already information there, do we have access to it, and how best should the work be done or would we prefer to spend money looking for something we have already?  We would like to see a co-ordinated strategy that goes back to when we started on this road in 2015 or 2016.  We need to bring everyone into a room so we know exactly where we are, what has been done to date, what is proposed to be done in the future so that we can all be a part of that at local and national level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for attending.  They were described by one of the previous speakers as the most important voice in the debate and it is in that vein that I ask the three organisations to give an evaluation on the consultation that has taken place to date, including in respect of Bord na M&oacute;na's engagement with Mr. Butler's organisation and the adjoining landowners, and the departmental and ministerial engagement.<\/p><p>In its opening statement, the ICMSA referenced the fact that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, announced &euro;108 million of taxpayer funding for a rewetting and restoration project.  He met workers and Bord na M&oacute;na, but did not meet adjoining landowners.  I wonder whether that has been corrected and whether there has been any engagement with relevant State bodies, as well is with Bord na M&oacute;na, and where improvements can be made.<\/p><p> Mr. Cullinan mentioned issues regarding flooding, which were outlined in some detail by the IFA and ICMSA in their opening statements.  We will meet representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na later.  In his opening statement, Dr. David Wilson cited a definition of \"rewetting\", stating that \"Clearly, in this regard rewetting does not equate to flooding\".  It would be useful if the organisations present could outline the basis of their concerns regarding the flooding of lands currently in productive use and what needs to be put in place to deal with that.<\/p><p> The issue of turbary rights has been mentioned by those who have been cutting turf on Bord na M&oacute;na land for their private use.  If there have been discussions on how those rights could be upheld on alternative land or arrangements have been put in place which the witnesses are aware of, I would like to hear about that.<\/p><p> I was interested in Mr. Curley's submission and his remarks on an alternative view to the strategy in place.  He said rewetting is not suitable for all bogs.  Could he go into a little more detail as to the alternatives?  Are there are any signs from the Department or Bord na M&oacute;na that they are willing to consider alternative uses of land for carbon sequestration through alternative mechanisms?<\/p><p> This project will be significant in respect of our climate obligations.  Taxpayers will invest substantial funding.  In the most recent round, &euro;108 million of taxpayers' money was allocated to the restoration project.  Bord na M&oacute;na, a semi-State company, is putting in another &euro;18 million.  By any account, that will likely be followed with further investment.  That is a lot of money on behalf of the taxpayer.  There needs to be full accountability and transparency on how decisions are made and full engagement with people who are affected by these decisions. <\/p><p> As this committee examines that issue, we need to be definitive in regard to ownership.  The land and the projects that benefit from funding need to remain the responsibility of the State.  Bord na M&oacute;na cannot decide at any point in the medium to long term that it is going to walk away and pass this on to other agencies or put it into the hands of some international conglomerate or something of that nature.  We need to be very clear in our messaging.  If, as a people, we are going to invest this level of funding the stakeholders involved need to be engaged with and the public needs to have assurances that this is being done in the public good, as opposed to there being any interior motive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#E00400","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I thank the farming organisations for coming before us and giving us their detailed presentations.  I come from County Offaly, which is very much the focus of this work.  It appears that the process is being rushed and pushed, which causes some concern.<\/p> <p>  I have been contacted by a number of concerned farmers who feel that the consultation with Bord na M&oacute;na was not good from the start.  It needs to be more forthcoming in its communications, which need to be lot better.  This is a serious issue.  Areas in Offaly, in particular west Offaly, are badly affected by flooding as we speak.  We do not want more flooding unnecessarily if the process is not carried out properly.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the risk of flooding to farmland and possible damage to houses and infrastructure nearby, which will cost us money, why is the emphasis being put on bogs to sequester carbon when grassland can also do that?  I refer to our forestry crisis.  We are not meeting climate change targets.  We should plant 8,000 ha per year, as per the programme for Government commitment, but that is not happening.  We should not focus on bogs alone, but also on forestry, if we can get the crisis in the sector sorted out quickly.  We also need to focus on grassland.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about turbary rights.  County Offaly depends heavily on turf.  As one presentation stated, 38% of its population depends on it.  Has any agreement on that issue been reached with Bord na M&oacute;na?  What progress has been made?  It is important that private turf cutters are protected and that a written agreement is also drawn up to protect their rights. <\/p> <p>  I fully support what all of the groups here are trying to achieve, as outlined in their submissions.  I made a submission on this issue because I am concerned about flooding, farmers' rights being trodden on and people being affected.  I was glad that the submission date was extended.

The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has not engaged significantly with local landowners and the people to whom Deputy Nolan referred.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carthy asked about consultation to date. There has been a lot of discussion.  We will have a meeting with Bord na M&oacute;na tomorrow for further discussions.  There have been local meetings with affected people and a list of questions have been put to its representatives.  It is to be hoped we will make significant progress on those answers at the meeting tomorrow. <\/p> <p>  To respond to a point made by Deputy Fitzmaurice, we have received nothing in writing at this point in time.  Until the ink dries, nothing has been secured, such as the turf cutting rights for locals Deputy Nolan mentioned.  It is absolutely critical that such arrangements are in writing.  We need to get commitments on a good code of practice in writing. <\/p> <p>  Equally, I agree with Deputy Nolan's comment that there is major frustration in some farm families, and that farmers want to put land into forestry but are not in a position to do so at this point in time.  There are a significant number of other ways of meeting our climate obligations and targets, including the management of grassland and plantations of forestry.  There will be a combined effort as we move forward, but it is not only farmers that will be affected.  Rural dwellers can be significantly affected, a point on which Deputy Nolan touched. <\/p> <p>  Houses may be flooded, something we have seen time and again in the news.  There has been flood after flood in various towns and cities.  There is potential that will happen in rural parts of the affected areas.

As far as consultation is concerned, we have had a lot of it.  We can sign off on agreements next week or the week after, but what is more important is the continuation of engagement.  That is what I have heard.  This is a major project involving farmers and their livelihoods.  They have to be protected.  We are not going to do this overnight.  This is an ongoing process.<\/p> <p>  Flooding was mentioned.<\/p><p>What Bord na M&oacute;na is proposing to achieve here is that there must be growth on the bog, where the peat has been taken out now for years.  What we have at the moment is that carbon is being emitted; it is coming up out of the bog into the atmosphere.  What it is doing is creating a seal and creating growth in order that the carbon will be sequestered in.  It becomes an excellent carbon sink.  We all acknowledge where we are.  Deputy Carthy made the valid point that a lot of taxpayers' money is being invested here.  We must ensure that when this work is completed, this project stays within the State and this carbon is used to offset the carbon within our own country.  Where this carbon will be going is something we have to look at in the forestry area as well because we, as farmers, are being blamed.  Therefore, it is very important, going forward, that we take account of that carbon and obviously the taxpayers' money being spent here.<\/p><p> Deputy Nolan made valid points about the flooding, draw and particularly lands and farmlands.  I was in County Offaly last year and we saw the effects of flooding from the Shannon.  Part of that would have been because of some of the processes in Bord na M&oacute;na, where there has been silting in the bed of the Shannon as well, and that has created problems in its own right.  I see this as an ongoing engagement.  We all know that Bord na M&oacute;na will be ceasing the production of peat, briquettes and turf completely but it is in the renewable energy business as well.  We want to see the renewable energy industry develop further.  Perhaps there has not been huge engagement with farmers on wind turbines.  In this project we must get more direct engagement with farmers to develop projects around increasing farmers' income.  That is where we must go with this.  Deputy Nolan also mentioned forestry.  I do not think we are going to waste time on it this evening but it is another issue that is in chaos at present.  We want to see the Minister coming out.

We sought a meeting with the Minister of State as far back as last July, anticipating this was going to happen and she basically refused to meet us all along.  We did meet for a while about three weeks ago on a Zoom call but some of the plans had actually been dealt with, though they did extend the time for submissions.  The consultation therefore has not been good, to answer that part of the question.<\/p> <p>  On the second part - and this is key - there is no ambition to get the scheme back on the bogs and the plants back on the bogs.  Rewetting simply will not do that.  Rewetting also brings an awful lot of dangers.  The committee has heard about the ones for farmers but there are also water quality dangers.  If there is bare peat with water on it and there is a bad flood event, some of that peat is going to end up in the local rivers, it is as simple as that.  Rewetting and the unnatural holding back of water is a dangerous game, therefore.  When it gets to summer time we might then finish up with a dry, cracked desert because the evaporation will take the water out anyway.  We are saying there needs to be a little more ambition in this regard.  The only ambition the board and Department seem to have is to re-wet the bogs and hope forlornly that it will all come out right.  They need to get in there.  Bog obviously stores carbon but one gets the carbon to go in by getting the plants back on it.<\/p> <p>  Second, these are all natural ecosystems, they are wild areas which everyone is crying out for and as I said earlier, they are also great for pollinator plants.  A lot of the bog plants are superb pollinator plants.  This is, therefore, a real opportunity to get this right.  Deputy Carthy is right that a lot of money is being put in here and it deserves to be spent properly.  The board and Department need to look a little bit wider than they are doing and engage.  It is down to local people.  Local people know their bogs, they know the level of water in the bogs.  If they engage properly with them they will get this right, if they do not, this could be one ferocious mess and be one for a long time to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Curley"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Brien, a farmer from County Offaly, wants to make a few points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#G00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  Going back to what Deputy Carthy said, there has perhaps been a degree of negligence by the Ministers involved.  That money did not come with terms and conditions.  We should not have to be meeting Bord na M&oacute;na and looking for this written agreement now.  There should have been terms and conditions that it would not impact the adjoining lands.  When this land is re-wetted now, after a heavy rainfall, all the rain off that 33,000 ha is going to be heading to a few rivers.  At the moment those rivers are not able to take the water that is coming.  The bogs at the moment are soaking up that and releasing it slowly but when it is flooded, it is flooded.  It will all be heading the same way and the farmland is in the first line.  Unless those drains are maintained and it is given in writing farmers will not have confidence.  There is fear that we simply will be forgotten.<br\/><br\/>When the bogs were initially taken over by Bord na M&oacute;na, promises were made.  There are very few left today who remember those promises.  There still are a few but nobody from Bord na M&oacute;na who gave those promises is still around and in ten or 20 years' time it will be the same case again.  It is not just the people who are going to be affected by this in ten years' time, people will be affected for generations.  Generations of work has gone into turning those bogs into working farmland, which produces food.  That can all be swept aside in a couple of years.  It is therefore vital that written assurances are given and that those drains are maintained, going forward.  Mr. Michael Newman, a former employee of the Department, had a very interesting letter published in the <i>Westmeath Examiner <\/i>a couple of weeks back.  In it, he referred to the same thing and noted that the majority of the silt in the Shannon has come from those bogs.  He said that if the Shannon were cleaned, a lot of the flooding that is going on in the country at present would not be taking place.  The cart has been put before the horse here in a rush to get the bogs re-wetted apparently within the term of this Government.  The drainage works on the Shannon, the Brosna and all the other rivers should have been done before the rewetting takes place so the water has somewhere to go when it is released from these bogs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>There are a few points I want to come back to there.  From the meeting I had with them, a lot of the bogs at issue were raised bogs once but a lot of the peat would be off them now.  We have bogs around us, 3,000 ha that were re-wetted by the NPWS years ago and to be honest, there has not been a problem, provided it is done right.  That is the bottom line.  The ecologists I spoke to are talking about putting in sphagnum mosses and all the usual stuff.  What surprises me is that under the habitats directive, one must be able to regenerate a bog in say, 30 years, and to be honest I do not think we will get active raised bog habitat flying in those bogs in that length of time.  I will add a note for the farming organisations based on my own experience as a turf cutter and contractor, which I am proud of.  I walked a lot of the bogs right round the country at the time of the debacle and up in the midlands - Mr. Rushe would know what I am on about here and so would the guys from County Offaly - there is what we call white turf.  There is probably 8 ft or 10 ft of it around County Offaly and some parts of County Kildare, which gets very heavy.<\/p><p>However, on a lot of Bord na M&oacute;na's bogs, much of that has been used.  It will be hundreds of years before they come back.  If an intact bog in the midlands was to be rewetted, one would need to watch out.  I would be afraid that the moisture would cause cracking of the bog and there would be bog slippage.  The west of Ireland has more of an Atlantic raised bog.  There is only a couple of feet of white turf and then there is brown and black turf, which is a totally different ball game.  <\/p><p> Another thing I would say to Mr. Cullinan and to Mr. McCormack, which was raised earlier, is that there should be a national agreement with everything included.  Local committees were mentioned as probably the best way to feed into that.  This agreement needs to be made very clear.  In fairness, 10,000 or 15,000 ha have been done so far and there have not been any problems.  However, the one thing that needs to be made very clear by the farming organisations, and politicians will stand very solidly beside them, is that before any of this goes ahead, the agreement will be guaranteed in black and white.  This agreement is not just for now but for 20, 40 and 60 years' time.  If it is not guaranteed, farmers will not co-operate and it will not be done on the bogs.  The farmers will stand up in each community.  While this cannot be done at the moment, there is no reason it could not be done when Covid is over.  I saw it before when people had to stand up and be counted.  The farming community needs to say to Bord na M&oacute;na that there is an agreement, it has to be signed up to and farmers have to be protected.  They are just a few things to watch out for, based on my experience of rewetting bogs ten or 15 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#G00500","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>We are near our time limit.

I agree with the earlier point about the money, work, effort and time that farmers put in over generations to manage, maintain and make unworkable land into fertile farmland.  We are dealing with the best of productive land and that has to be protected.<\/p> <p>  We also need to keep an open mind.  If Bord na M&oacute;na proves the levels of carbon that can be sequestered on peatlands, is there an opportunity for farmers in those areas to do some of that themselves?  I am not talking about using all their land, but portions of it if there is potential.  We have to keep an open mind, particularly in the vulnerable sectors, about alternative income streams.  That is something farmers have made very clear to us. <\/p> <p>  On Deputy Carthy's question about horticultural peat, it is absolute madness what could happen.  I live beside Timahoe bog, which is due to be rewetted.  There are many nurseries there that use horticultural peat, which was available following a ten-minute drive up the road.  Those nurseries are now pricing container loads of horticultural peat from Lithuania.  That is what we are looking at and it makes no sense.  It will have huge implications for a sector that we all agree we would like to see grow.  It is a solid, profitable sector.<\/p> <p>  On the working groups, there is a liaison officer on the ground.  Covid is not an excuse not to actively and continuously engage with farmers on the ground   We have proved that we can use Zoom and Team.  This is an opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na and it is important it takes it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Rushe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  Deputy Fitzmaurice talked about a national agreement with local committees.  I always dread the term \"local committee\".  I would like to see a local steering group.  There are liaison officers and field officers out there but they are no substitute for stakeholders having the opportunity to express their views around the table.  Covid will not last forever and organisations and groups at local level can get in and steer it from a local level.  As my colleague, Mr. O'Brien, put it, farm families have worked very hard improving land and all that good work could be cleared in a very short space of time.<\/p> <p>  As regards Deputy Carthy's question on horticultural peat, it has been a serious alternative to straw for animal bedding.  It is compliant, to the highest standards, from an animal welfare point of view.  The decline in the tillage area farmed in this country is of huge concern, as is the effect on local nurseries mentioned by Mr. Rushe.  Ultimately, different stakeholders will be there for the long term.  Some farm families were in the affected areas pre-Bord na M&oacute;na and they will, hopefully, be there after Bord na M&oacute;na.  What happens regarding land wetting will have a critical impact on whether they will or will not be there.<\/p> <p>  Senator Daly asked a question earlier on incorporating farmland.  Those farmers have no desire to see their land go into wetting.  They want to farm their land, live a simple life and make ends meet for their families.  The stakeholders who will be there the longest are the farm families, subject to being respected in the months ahead.  We will certainly continue to liaise with anyone who wishes to do so, whether it is the landowners, a significant proportion of whom are our members, or the various local representatives.

Undrained peatlands are net carbon sinks, as the amount of CO2 sequestered from the atmosphere by the peatland is greater than the amount of methane emitted by the peatland, and the amount of carbon released into streams and rivers.  However, the vast majority of peatlands in Ireland have been drained, either for turf cutting, energy production, horticulture, agriculture or forestry.  In each case, the fundamental goal of drainage is to lower the water level within the soil to facilitate the movement of machinery across the peat, for the grazing of livestock, and the growth of plant species, such as agricultural grasses and trees, which do not thrive under water-saturated conditions.  Drainage results in considerable changes in many aspects of the peatland.  For carbon dynamics, the lowering of the water level increases the oxygen content of the peat, which stimulates microbial decomposition of the organic matter and the release of the carbon contained therein.  Studies in Ireland and abroad have shown that drained peatlands are a net CO2 source, emit less methane than undrained sites and release more carbon to adjacent water bodies than undrained sites.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s national inventory report, NIR, 2020, greenhouse gas emissions from the estimated 330,000 ha of drained grassland on organic peat soils under the land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, sector are reported at 8.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.  Recent work by Teagasc, however, indicates that the area of grassland on drained peat soils could be 450,000 ha, which would suggest that emissions from this land-use category may be currently underestimated by 3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.<\/p> <p>  Industrial peat extraction areas are a persistent source of CO2 for as long as the drains or water pumping, or both, remain in operation.  Work in Ireland and the UK indicates that drained, cutaway and cutover sites emit approximately 6 tonnes of CO2 per hectare every year.  Moreover, while methane emissions may decrease from the main peat extraction areas, carbon loading on adjacent water bodies is significantly increased.  In NIR 2020, emissions from peat extraction areas are reported at 1.15 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.  However, this is likely to be a gross underestimation as the areas impacted by domestic turf cutting are nominally estimated in the report at only 400 ha, due to the absence of high-resolution land use data.<\/p><p>In NIR 2020, forestry on organic soils under LULUCF is reported as a sink of 1.88 million tonnes on 450,000 ha.  Recent data, however, suggest that the default soil emission factor used in the models may be unrealistic and that soil emissions from the forest stand may be much higher, in which case forestry on peat could switch from acting as a net CO2 sink to a net CO2 source.<\/p><p> In addition to having a deleterious impact on climate forcing, peatland drainage also results in the release of aquatic organic carbon, nitrates, ammonium, loss of flood control and water storage capacity, and an increased risk of fires.  Recent research has also highlighted the presence of trihalomethanes, potential carcinogens, in the waters located in peat catchments.<\/p><p> Rewetting of peat soils has been suggested as an important climate change mitigation tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create suitable conditions for carbon sequestration, stimulate biodiversity and improve water quality.  How do we define rewetting?  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's wetlands supplement describes it as \"the deliberate action of raising the water table on drained soils to re-establish water saturated conditions, for example, by blocking drainage ditches or disabling pumping facilities, and managing the water table so that it remains close to the surface&rdquo;. <\/p><p>Clearly, in this regard, rewetting does not equate to flooding.  Rewetting is achieved through a suite of management actions that are tailored to the site in question.  The principal method is to block the drains, which involves stopping or slowing the flow of water along the drain.  Alternative dam materials include plastic sheets and wood, while coconut fibre logs have been used on some peatland sites to reduce the overground lateral flow of the water.  On some sites, a berm is installed at the edge of the site to prevent water from leaving, while on others a compartmental approach is employed to hold rainfall on the site. <\/p><p> Peatland rewetting can have several objectives, such as restoration, which aims to establish a functioning peatland ecosystem, although rewetting can also allow other management practices, such as paludiculture, or wet agriculture, to take place on the saturated peat soils.  In Ireland, peatland rewetting has focused mainly on cutaway and cutover sites, with a smaller quantity of former forest lands also rewetted under various EU-funded projects.  From a carbon and climate point of view, the aim is to establish a water level where greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, CO2 sequestration resumes and methane emissions are minimised.<\/p><p> Studies have shown the optimal water level to be between 10 cm and 15 cm below the soil surface, although it must be maintained at that level as much as possible throughout the year, and particularly during the growing season, to minimise soil emissions.  On sites where greenhouse gases have been monitored, CO2 emissions are significantly reduced following rewetting, and in many instances the rewetted site can quickly become a CO2 sink once more, in tandem with the re-establishment of suitable plant communities.  However, a wide range of greenhouse gas values have been reported for rewetted peatlands, largely driven by differences between climate zones and peatland nutrient status.<\/p><p> My experience of working on Bord na M&oacute;na rewetted cutaway bogs over the past 20 years has been that for the majority of these sites, the flooding of adjacent lands has not been an issue, an experience in agreement with the community living around Abbeyleix bog, for example.  Issues might exist, however, for those areas around the River Shannon where industrial extraction was previously facilitated by the active pumping of drainage water and where flooding, as opposed to rewetting, may be a problem when the pumps are switched off.  For cutover sites, rewetting of drained special area of conservation, SAC, sites has been carried out mainly by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, which has rewetted, or is in the process of rewetting, 50,000 ha of raised bogs.<\/p><p> The NPWS places considerable emphasis on developing site-specific drainage management plans that utilise aerial imagery, ground surveys and hydrological modelling and monitoring.  It actively engages with landowners and farmers and provides compensation when required.  To ensure that the water remains on the target area on all rewetted raised bog sites, the marginal drain is generally retained, although it can be blocked if the adjacent landowner is in agreement.  Technical implementations include the construction of berms or bunds to hold back water, while on some sites the installation of outfalls and weirs even permit a degree of control of the water level.<\/p><p> The momentum for peatland rewetting is clearly increasing.  The peatlands climate action scheme, launched in November 2020, initially targets 33,000 ha for rewetting on more than 80 Bord na M&oacute;na bogs.  Under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's Ag Climatise roadmap, released in December 2020, at least 40,000 ha of drained grassland on peat soils has been targeted for rewetting.  Rewetting of these soils is interesting as it has not been widely implemented in this country, although it has been carried out in other jurisdictions.  In contrast to cutover and cutaway sites, where there is an emphasis on restoration to a functioning peatland ecosystem, with a desire to bring back characteristic peatland flora and fauna, rewetting of drained grassland sites offers the opportunity to target solely a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  To date, only one study in Ireland has evaluated the potential for greenhouse gas emission reductions in this land use category and showed that carbon dioxide sequestration and minimal methane emissions could be achieved even at water levels down to 25 cm in depth.  <\/p><p> The Ag Climatise roadmap also identifies the requirement to identify the drainage status of this land use category to reduce carbon losses through water table management.  This is critical to determine accurately the area of drained soils; the differentiation between deep drained and shallow drained soils; nutrient status, as greenhouse gas emissions from drained nutrient-rich fen peats are considerably higher than emissions from drained nutrient-poor peats; and the area of rewetted soils, to ensure that Ireland can avail of greenhouse gas emission reductions in future national inventory reporting.<\/p><p> A new Teagasc project will address some of the uncertainties associated with the rewetting of grasslands and enable Ireland to benefit from the 2018 EU effort sharing regulation.  The experience of farmers, landowners and organisations such as the community wetlands forum that will participate in the new European innovation partnerships announced by the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on 12 February 2021, will be highly informative and build on the outstanding work carried out by ongoing farmer-orientated projects, such as the Burren Life, pearl mussel and hen harrier projects.  These will provide an important platform to evaluate the potential of transitioning from current conventional practices to new carbon farming models.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Wilson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>That was a very knowledgeable briefing for the committee on the benefits of rewetting.

It is cited at 0.59 tonnes, whereas relevant data from nearby sites suggest it should be at least 1 tonne, if not 2 tonnes, higher than that.  If that is factored into the model, it would flip the forestry sector on organic soils from being a net CO2 sink to being a net CO2 source.  A large proportion of the new data are based on work from the University of Limerick, where soil CO2 emissions were quantified from eight forestry sites.  A new emission factor was developed and has been submitted for review in a peer review journal.

In regard to how much carbon will be taken in, we know that 6 million tonnes of CO2 is released into drains.  Rewetting, if done successfully and maintained over the year, will shut that down.  We will, therefore, make avoided losses or saving 6 million tonnes of CO2.  If we can get the right plant communities in and maintain the water, we can flip the system so it becomes a sink.  The numbers vary and I am not being vague but it will depend on the sites.  If we can get a good site that remains wet, we can certainly look for anything between 0.5 and 1.5 tonnes of carbon - not CO2 - per hectare per year, which is not nothing, as they say.  It is a sizeable amount.  If we were moving towards a system where we have recreated the functions of the peatlands that resemble a natural or undrained site, that figure would lower the amount to something like 0.3 tonnes of CO2 carbon.  Initially, when rewetting starts the system becomes very vigorous whereby a lot of carbon goes in and new plants come in.  So one is looking at anything between 0.5 to 1.5 tonnes of CO2 carbon, not CO2.  One must multiply the amount by 3.66 to get the amount of CO2.  One has made the savings of 6 million tonnes of CO2 and then one has the addition of the sequestration, provided the site remains wet, particularly during the summer months.<\/p> <p>  On the second question, the Department has identified at least 40,000 ha of grassland on organic soils.  The point is that because it is on organic soils it is not sequestering but releasing carbon.  That is reflected in our submissions to the national inventory reporting 8 million tonnes of CO2 per year.  It is not sequestering carbon.  If it was mineral soil then, there might be a small amount of carbon sequestered by the mineral soil or grassland.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's third question was on whether a 30-year period is used by Bord na M&oacute;na.  That is a number used to give us a chance to flip the system so we are not expecting results immediately.  What we are finding in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is that if rewetting is done successfully and maintained, the system flips back quite quickly.  Methane emissions are always an issue in the early years because a lot of organic matter has been created for the microbes to work on, the bog has been rewetted and there is no oxygen in the system and there is, therefore, a flush and spike of methane in the early years.  The thinking, and it is only thinking, is that in 30 years that methane spike will have cleared itself and the system will be more akin to a natural site in that it will take in a small amount of CO2 every year but only releases a small amount of methane.  A 30-year period probably reflects that but nobody really knows.  We do not have many long-term rewetting sites, certainly not in Ireland, where we can go in and identify what happens in terms of the greenhouse gas dynamics.  To me, 30 years sounds reasonable and is not totally short term.  If we are looking very long term, we would be looking at hundreds of years.  I agree with Dr. Flynn that 30 years is something we could look at and work with.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's described turf cutting as inconsequential.  It is inconsequential only because the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, does not know what is out there.  When the EPA gets a better handle on what is out there and how much it is affected, the 400 ha figure will increase, possibly by a large amount.  This will be dependent on better land use mapping and better use of remote sensing data.  I am sorry to tell the Deputy that turf cutting is not inconsequential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Wilson"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I think it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#L00600","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Deputy Carthy asked about grassland.

They were very high emitters so there was an impetus to rewet.

There could be much to learn from the experience of the community in Abbeyleix.  I cannot offer any solutions on the flooded areas.  I can only say that from a greenhouse gas and climate point of view, it is not something we would like to see either.  Flooding is not of benefit for greenhouse gas removals because there are no plant communities to pull in CO2, and methane and CO2 are released from the water bodies that are flooded.  It is certainly not something we would like to see in terms of climate mitigation.  In fact, it would only exacerbate the climate issues.<\/p> <p>  As regards methane, the Deputy is right about rewetting being site-specific.  There are some sites that will never be re-wetted and cannot physically be re-wetted, such as sites that are on slopes.  Some of the sites in the midlands may be problematic as, according to projected climate change, the summers are predicted to be drier.  There will be less rain and the sites may dry out.  For some of the work we have carried out, that would be extremely problematic because the sites that were previously Bord na M&oacute;na sites are nutrient rich and are likely to be high CO2 emitters.  If rewetting is not maintained during the summer, they will continue to remain CO2 emitters even though they have ostensibly been re-wetted.  They are problematic and from that point of view the rewetting issue is site-specific.<\/p> <p>  Methane is something we just have to live with.  It is part and parcel of the rewetting package and as I mentioned earlier, the hope is that after the initial years of rewetting the methane spike will decline, in which case the amount of CO2 taken in by the site will compensate for the loss of methane that occurs immediately after the rewetting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Wilson"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Wilson.

We have received much feedback from the stakeholders we have met and I have heard a lot commercially about the lack of engagement and communication Bord na M&oacute;na is having with communities.  The neighbouring farmers aside, there is the potential here for flooding which would change the biodiversity and the layout and maybe even create safety concerns for parents in broader areas.

Before I answer the questions, I will address why we are doing rehabilitation.  As has been mentioned by many public representatives, Ireland has ambitious carbon emission reduction targets by 2030.  Due to the permanent ending of peat production and the rehabilitation of 33,000 ha, we will play a significant part in Ireland's climate action programme in the coming years.  We will move from being a carbon source to a carbon store and eventually to becoming a carbon sink.<\/p> <p>  The peatlands rehabilitation of Bord na M&oacute;na lands and other land is a key pillar of Bord na M&oacute;na's brown to green strategy, as we eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels and redirect our efforts to investment in renewable energy, recycling operations and low-carbon business operations.  On other lands, we work with the NPWS on rehabilitation.  We will create employment for approximately 350 employees in Bord na M&oacute;na in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  As Bord na M&oacute;na has been managing the peatlands in Ireland for approximately 90 years, we have a lot of experience of peatland management, initially starting with the drainage infrastructure.  We have more than 30 years of experience of peatlands rehabilitation, as referred to by previous contributors.  We have a lot of experience in this area.  We know this is a major project and we have been engaged in significant consultation with a number of parties in recent months.  All of the farming communities have acknowledged that we have been engaging with them.  When we talk about rehabilitation, it is important to understand what we mean by the rewetting of peatlands as opposed to the flooding of the peatlands.  I will call on my colleague, Ms King, to outline what we mean by the drainage of the peatlands, what part of a bog will be impacted, and how we leave the outer part of the bog, especially the outer drain, open to ensure that we can reduce the risk of flooding on adjoining lands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Breen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank the committee members.  We issued a graphic and if it is available, I will refer members to it to describe our proposals.  When Bord na M&oacute;na started peat production, it excavated drains.  The purpose of the drains was to remove the water off the bog quickly.  The production fields between those drains were cambered, so there was a high point, the water flowed into the drains and then was removed from the bog.  That was in order that we could produce peat because the water would have impeded that.<\/p> <p>  What we are doing now is trying to revert to the original state of the bogs.  We are trying to hold the water on the bog and to delay the run-off of the water.  We are trying to get the water to the surface of the bog.  We are not trying to flood the bogs.  Dr. McCorry will be able to explain from an ecology point of view the benefits of having the water on the surface.  We are putting in a series of peat dams.  We block the production drains.  If members look on their graphic, they can see the faint lines in the first slide.  They are the production drains in the bogs that were excavated by Bord na M&oacute;na 40 or 50 years ago.  They are the drains that we will be blocking.  There will be frequent blocks in the drains.  We will be levelling the fields so they are flat and consequently, the rain that falls on the bogs will sit on the fields for longer rather than disappearing off the bogs as quickly as it would have.<\/p> <p>  Any of the main drains that are around the perimeter of the bog or drains that flow through the bog to provide drainage to land upstream will not be blocked in order that there will not be an impact on adjoining land.  In response to a question from Senator Daly, we have appointed hydrologists as external consultants to carry out an assessment on every bog.  They are assessing the impact of the rewetting proposals on adjoining land and they are advising mitigation measures to prevent any impact.  They will identify if there is land that may be vulnerable.  If that is the case, we will provide a boundary drain and if we have to, we will pull back our rehabilitation from that area to ensure that we do not impact on adjoining land.  Bord na M&oacute;na does not want to cause any impacts to farmers and we do not intend to cause any impacts to farmers.  That is why we have the external hydrologists advising us in that regard.<\/p> <p>  If members look at the graph, they can see the blue line on the second slide.  This is a bog in County Tipperary.  The red dots are the drain blocks that were installed in all those drains.  We are trying to retain the water in the centre of the bog and trying to delay the water leaving the bog.  If there is a severe rainfall event, the water will be slower to leave the bog because it will not have a drainage system in the centre of the bog to get rid of it.  We are maintaining the drainage system around the edge of the bog, so as the water levels rise in the bog, once they get to the edge that drainage system will still carry the water in the way it always would have.  We can see there is fertile land around the bog and it will not be impacted by our plan.  I hope that explains the drainage system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021030200002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Doreen King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I will come back to a question asked by Senator Daly on what we mean by rewetting.

It is really about trying to bring the water levels back to the surface of the peat.  Regarding what we are trying to do with rehabilitation, we are trying to stabilise the water levels at the surface of the peat to create soggy peatland conditions.  If we can keep those conditions relatively stable during the year, we are going to reduce carbon emissions significantly.<\/p><p>Obviously, we are going to rewet the residual peat in the ground and maintain it in the ground.  This will also encourage natural colonisation of vegetation.  Mr. Curley referred to putting the skin back on the bog.  That is very much aligned with what we wish to do in terms of peatland rehabilitation.  Our approach is to try to rewet the peat because our 40 years' experience of peatland rehabilitation tells us that rewetting the peat encourages and accelerates natural colonisation such that we get that skin coming back.  As an ecologist, I want to see the bog cotton and the bog mosses appearing.  In particular, where possible, we do not wish to see indicators of drier conditions in the context of trees and so on.<\/p><p> If we do not carry out this rehabilitation or rewet the peatland, we will have continued carbon emissions from these bogs and will see continued erosion of peat and faster movement of water through the drains.  The rewetting is a very important and ambitious project in the context of Ireland's climate action objectives.  It will be very significant in that regard.  The project is very much about supporting the Government's climate action strategy.  It will have other benefits in the context of other ecosystem services.  In terms of biodiversity, it will create new habitats for the various species that depend on peatlands.  It will be very important for water attenuation and so on.<\/p><p> Another very important point that has been made during this session is that each bog is different.  In Bord na M&oacute;na, we have a wide range of environmental conditions.  On the issue of rewetting, while we would like to restore bog where possible, that will not be possible for many bogs where the majority of the peat has been cut away.  In such situations, the best outcomes are to try to develop other habitats.  Our objective in that regard is to rewet the peat but look for emerging vegetation.  We will see a mosaic of wetlands and bog woodland in those situations, particularly where there are different environmental conditions.<\/p><p> I hope that summarises what rewetting means.  I reiterate that Bord na M&oacute;na has been doing this for approximately 30 years.  I am sure many members are familiar with the Lough Boora Discovery Park, for example.

I am joined today by my colleagues: Professor Malcolm MacLachlan, clinical lead for people with disabilities; Ms Breda Crehan-Roche, chief officer, community healthcare organisation west; and Ms Angela O&rsquo;Neill, national disability specialist, community operations.<br\/><br\/>The ombudsman&rsquo;s report was published following extensive engagement by the Ombudsman for Children's office, OCO, with a wide range of stakeholders.  The HSE met with investigators in the OCO and provided significant levels of information to support the development of this report which emphasises the need for early intervention for children with disabilities as well as the requirement for additional resources to meet the demand for assessment of need.  <br\/><br\/>The OCO makes a number of recommendations with regard to the needs of children and young people with disabilities.  The HSE particularly welcomes the recommended review of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 and the relevant sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act.  The OCO identified a number of issues of concern with regard to the Act and the HSE agrees with this position and is committed to actively participating in any review of current legislation.  It is our firm belief that addressing compliance with the Disability Act and the obvious challenges posed by the assessment of need process must be considered within the context of a wider reform programme for children and young people&rsquo;s disability services.  While acknowledging the very significant level of resources allocated to disability service provision, which was approximately &euro;2.2 billion in 2021, planned multiannual investment coupled with reform of the sector is necessary in order to build and strengthen early intervention and the provision of family-centred supports. <br\/><br\/>In terms of reform specific to services for children and young people with complex disability support needs, the HSE and our voluntary agency partners are committed through the progressing disability services programme to reconfiguring services to children&rsquo;s disability network teams.  These teams will provide interdisciplinary, child and family-centred services for children based on their presenting needs rather than their diagnosis, a key concern referenced in the ombudsman's report.<\/p><p>The HSE and our lead agency partners are working hard to ensure that all children&rsquo;s disability services fully reconfigure to these network teams during the first and second quarters of 2021.  This change will ensure that children have access to early intervention rather than waiting long periods for diagnostic assessments and potentially ageing out of services before they access intervention.  While the HSE acknowledges that some education services continue to request a diagnosis, we fully support the recommendation of the OCO that the access criteria for such services should be reviewed and that a clear pathway based on need is required.<\/p><p> Since 2019, substantial additional resources have been allocated towards children&rsquo;s disability services with a particular focus on assessment of need.  For example, a total of 100 additional therapy posts were allocated in 2019 and targeted specifically towards assessment of need.  In 2020, &euro;7.8 million was allocated through the Sl&aacute;intecare healthcare reform initiative to facilitate the HSE to address the backlog of overdue assessments, thereby supporting these children's network teams being established to prioritise intervention having cleared the backlog of overdue assessments in each community healthcare organisation, CHO.  Furthermore, the HSE national service plan for 2021 allocated 100 additional posts to the new children's disability network teams.<\/p><p> Although additional resources are very welcome, we are aware the absence of the progressive disability services reform programme and changes in the assessment of need system will limit the opportunity for those resources to have real impact on the lives of children and young people with disabilities.  An internal HSE review of the practice of implementation of Part 2 of the Act in 2016 confirmed anecdotal evidence that the approach to assessment of need was not consistent across the country.  It was apparent that practice varied widely across the nine community health organisation areas, as well as within CHO areas.  Although a range of guidance notes relating to the assessment of need processes were issued as far back as 2007, there was no nationally standardised or agreed operational approach or definition of an assessment of need.<\/p><p> In an effort to standardise procedures and facilitate timely assessments, the HSE developed a standard operating procedure, SOP, for assessments of need.  The SOP was implemented for all assessment of need applications from January 2020.  Assessment of need now comprises a preliminary team assessment that will determine a child&rsquo;s needs and will identify initial interventions that will be required to meet these needs.  The HSE respects the important principle that clinicians undertaking assessments of need should use their clinical judgment in carrying out these assessments based on the presenting needs of the child.  However, it is critical to note that the practice of targeting resources exclusively towards assessments, sometimes taking up to 100 hours or more, is not the optimum use of valuable specialist resources.  Relevant to this area, the HSE has established a new national clinical programme for people with disabilities, which is supporting clinicians in carrying out their work and directly involves people with lived experience in the design of clinical assessment and interventions.  Related to this important development in the health sector, efforts are under way in terms of assessment of autism spectrum disorder, which now forms part of a dedicated service improvement programme aimed at developing supports and services for the autistic community.<\/p><p> These reforms are intended to alleviate the current situation whereby children in some parts of the country may wait a significant length of time before they can access an assessment.  During this waiting period, they often have little or no access to intervention or support.  This is unacceptable.  The changes in the standard operating procedure, and particularly the new assessment format, will facilitate children with disabilities to access assessment in a more timely fashion.  In essence, timely assessment along with ongoing intervention based on presenting need is a central principle guiding our work.<\/p><p> In conclusion, health policy, particularly the progressing disability services, PDS, project, has supported a move towards the provision of services based on need rather than diagnosis.  This aligns with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The HSE is committed to ensuring that children and young people with disabilities access equitable and timely intervention based on need rather than diagnosis.  The Disability Act 2005 in its current format can create barriers in this regard as a result of its focus on assessment rather than intervention.  Our priority is to ensure that people with disabilities can access both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal Morgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Morgan.

I have significant concerns about that, as well as about the fact that thousands of children have been waiting for years for assessment.

In other words, there are certain timeframes that must be met but it gives primacy to intervention.

To give the Deputy an overview of the concept of the preliminary team assessment, as Dr. Morgan stated, the Disability Act provides significant detail in terms of timeframes for assessment.  The associated regulations contain quite comprehensive detail in terms of our legal obligations.  What the Disability Act did not do is it did not define what an assessment of need should look like.  As members will be aware, what the Disability Act confers on people is an entitlement to have an assessment of need.  There is no associated entitlement to intervention.  What has evolved in recent years is that the focus has become exclusively on assessment and children are waiting very significant periods.  As the Deputy stated, some children wait several years for an assessment of need and then find that they go onto another very lengthy waiting list for intervention.  I can think of an example of a little boy of 18 months who was referred for an assessment of need in the context of a diagnostic autism spectrum disorder, ASD, assessment.  As he was waiting for a diagnostic ASD assessment, he was not able to access other services.<\/p><p>When he got his diagnostic assessment three years later, it was found that he did not have ASD.  That child therefore missed out on accessing any interventions in that three-year period.<\/p><p> We want to ensure with the standard operating procedure that children get a streamlined assessment within the timelines of the Disability Act 2005 and then go on to an intervention pathway immediately.  A little child like the one to whom I referred would have been seen and had his assessment commenced within three months, completed within another three months and he would have been on an intervention pathway on which the ASD diagnostic assessment would have evolved over time.  He would have had a period of diagnostic intervention rather than losing a three-year period while he was on a waiting list.  Our goal with this new procedure is to ensure that children are seen for a quick assessment but are also placed on an intervention pathway as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Neill.

I am talking in particular about community healthcare west, which is probably one of the highest achieving CHOs in respect of meeting the requirements.  The HSE rewarded inefficiencies with additional posts.  Has this situation been reviewed in the context of the service plan for 2021?  I am not sure to whom to direct this question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#C00400","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>That is fine, I will speak on those questions, if that is okay.

That is what is going to be done this year.<\/p> <p>  In previous years, such as last year when we had 100 additional posts, we did have regard to the census of staff in disability services, including physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, SLTs, psychology grade staff etc., to determine the quantum of posts being delivered.

I am not differentiating in this regard in respect of the primary care elements.  We see major investment in that area and that is required in the area of earlier diagnostics and avoiding people having to be admitted to our acute hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Disability, however, seems to be lacking the requisite focus and priority regarding investment.  I mean real investment.  Some of the milder developmental issues assessed are sent to primary care centres and assessed in that instance.

I will ask my questions at the start and I will leave time at the end for the witnesses to respond.  I thank the witnesses for attending today's meeting and for making a presentation to the committee.  I had a number of conversations with people who are directly affected by the standard operating procedure and their children's needs not being met.  I will raise some of the cases and I would be grateful if the witnesses could respond to them.<\/p> <p>  I have serious concerns about the replacement of the assessment of need with the new tool, the standard operating procedure, as it does not increase the speed at which children can access meaningful intervention.  It only serves to move them from one waiting list to another and there is no statutory time limit for the second list and therefore little recourse.  The Ombudsman for Children stated to the committee that it was like an old-fashioned three-card trick, moving children from one list to another without getting the developmental treatment they require.  These concerns have been raised by parents and professionals alike.  A parent from Enough is Enough stated to the committee that parents are terrified of their requirement under the standard operating procedure.  It could mean that they could miss something in their child's development that could hinder them accessing services going forward.  Parents are under enough pressure already.  As they said at the committee meeting, they are not therapists themselves.  What is the role of parents in the new process and what supports, if any, will parents be given?  It was raised directly with me that while the HSE talks about reducing the waiting lists that the standard operating procedure is just a box-ticking exercise, as was mentioned earlier.  Therapists involved in providing assessments of need have vigorously and repeatedly opposed the changes and have stated that they will harm children, yet the HSE has proceeded with them regardless.  The Psychological Society of Ireland, the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland and the Irish Association of Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists have stated their clearly articulated concerns that the SOP does not address the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  Is the purpose of the changes to reduce the HSE's legal liability due to breaches of the statutory obligation to assess children in a timely manner?<\/p> <p>  I was informed in response to a parliamentary question I asked in the D&aacute;il that the HSE has spent more than &euro;700,000 in defending the State in its failure to provide assessments of need in a timely manner under the Disability Act.  That money could and should be spent on providing the service the children need instead of defending the indefensible.  Why is the HSE defending the indefensible?<\/p> <p>  In the North, for example in Derry, children identified as having developmental needs are seen by their local intervention team, which includes healthcare and therapy staff, within eight to ten weeks of a referral.  If they are deemed to require an assessment, for example, for autism, this assessment is available within another eight to 12 weeks but, crucially, the child is provided with the intervention in the interim.  That is the main requirement.  Has the HSE considered that approach as a model of treatment?<\/p> <p>  If a child gets an assessment of need in this State, the problems are only beginning.  I recently received three responses from the HSE, which I will read out but I will not identify the children.  Connor, aged seven, was transferred to the school age team from the early intervention team.  The current wait for these services is 40 months.  Tyler was referred to the school age team and was placed on the waiting list for early intervention.  The current wait for the multidisciplinary team is 40 months and the HSE will not offer him a service until 2023.  Luke, aged five, was referred to the early intervention team.  If Luke turns six while he is waiting on services, he will be transferred to a school age team.  The current wait is 40 months and it is estimated that Luke will be offered these services in May 2024.<\/p> <p>  One can understand the concerns of parents given what has been said by the witnesses today.  I welcome some of the initiatives that were outlined.  However, it is only white noise to them.  They are not getting the treatment their children need when they need it.  These are more examples of moving children from one list to another without getting the service they need.<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks the committee discussed the abuse parents and children received in the mother and baby homes.  It was said to me that the State could be complicit in the systemic abuse of children by failing its statutory obligation to provide them with the timely treatment they need in order to reach their developmental milestones.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#D00400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>There is a minute and a half left for Dr. Morgan to respond to some of those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#D00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I will.  I thank Deputy Ward.  I will share the response with my colleague, Professor MacLachlan, because there are some clinical related matters that I would like to have addressed.  First, the very reason we endorsed the ombudsman&rsquo;s report and introduced these reforms such as the progressive disability services is precisely to do what he has quite rightly referred to, which is, that we must intervene quickly to carry out assessments but we must intervene.  Intervention is really the most important thing.  The standard operating procedure, the setting up of the new interdisciplinary network teams and the additional resources that were given to the teams &ndash; another &euro;6 million was provided for a round of new therapy posts this year alone, on top of what we have put in already, and there are more to come &ndash; is precisely to move to a scenario where rapid assessment and intervention takes place but the primacy must be on intervention.  We have looked at other models as well.  Professor MacLachlan will address this, as we have established a new national clinical programme specifically for disabilities.<\/p> <p>  I have two points to make regarding the resources that are expended through the legal channels.  One is that it is important to recognise that people have an entitlement to go to the courts for redress.  That is an important element of our legal infrastructure.  Of course, I much prefer to spend the resources on delivering intervention.  I always say that, and my colleagues say it, but when a case is taken we have to enter into the process, but we want to avoid that as much inasmuch as we can.<\/p> <p>  On the parental involvement in the process, as I referenced in my opening statement, in progressive disability services our model now is much more about child and family-centred practice where interdisciplinary teams will work with parents or carers alongside the children so that it becomes a genuine plan of intervention not just for the child but also for the parents concerned.  That is why we are trying to emphasise the need to shift reform away from silo-driven interventions by singular disciplines to one of an interdisciplinary response.<\/p> <p>  I respect where the Deputy is coming from, from the point of view of the concerns by the professional bodies, which is to be respected.  Professor MacLachlan will address this now.  It is fundamentally important to keep in mind two things: one is that we have done a lot of work with clinicians doing the work on the ground.  That is really important as they are delivering the interventions.  Professor MacLachlan will refer to them in the context of his work as a national clinical lead.  I will ask him to come in on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal Morgan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ward for his questions.  I will start towards the end.  I think there really would be a concern that the State was being complicit in providing poor treatment had we not introduced the standard operating procedure.  As the Deputy is aware, there were lengthy waiting lists and they have dramatically reduced.  I think that is a very important positive action that we have taken.  The national clinical programme for people with disabilities has been set up specifically to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to make it focus in particular on the needs of people with disabilities from an intervention perspective.  Of course, we all appreciate that assessment is important, but it is done for a purpose.  As Deputy Ward said, what people need is an intervention, even if it is only in the interim while they wait for a fuller assessment to take place.  Assessment is not a one-off process.  One does an assessment that indicates a potential intervention, one provides that intervention and that intervention in itself is a form of assessment and is a continuing process.<\/p><p>The standard operating procedure has been specifically introduced to prioritise the importance of intervention, to have it informed by prior assessment but not to have the unfortunate situation we had before, where people were on waiting lists for a long time for an assessment and then in some cases waiting four or five years for an intervention following the assessment.  We could not stand over that and that is why it has been so important to develop a standard operating procedure that is effective, efficient and even more important, is equitable, in order that we do not have huge variations across the country in terms of access to interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank Professor MacLachlan.

One of the ways in which people often talk about this is through clinical risk.  I have heard some commentary about the clinical risk that is involved or mitigated through very lengthy assessments.  As I stated previously, one of the issues in having extremely lengthy assessments and then long waiting lists for interventions is that it ignores the clinical risk that is involved in not intervening.  If one looks at Articles 25 and 26 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, they really emphasise the importance of rapid intervention.  The ethical issue is not alone about assessment, it is about timely intervention and intervention that is appropriate to the needs of the person as soon as possible.

However, in policy terms, if one looks at progressive disability services, in the UN convention that Professor MacLachlan referenced, assessment in and of itself without an interdisciplinary intervention programme is meaningless.  As Deputy Ward outlined, parents are waiting and crying out for intervention.  The additional resources to clear the backlog allow the network teams that are being set up as we speak and that will be fully in place by the end of this quarter, quarter 2.

The subsequent HSE response to me of 17 December was that in respect of community CAMHS services, the waiting times for young people to be seen by the child and adolescent mental health services continue to be an issue in a number of CHOs.  It stated that a renewed focus on improving capacity and throughput was in place in this area and some improvement was being shown.  I cannot say that is the case in CHO 4.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Morgan spoke about silos previously.  In the very short time available, if we are talking about knocking down silos, then CAMHS needs to be put under the microscope.  He can correct me if I am wrong, but my perception is that CAMHS operates as a silo and until that silo is smashed and there is a greater interdisciplinarity about the way in which teams operate at a community level then we are not going to see the throughput in respect of the therapeutic effects based on the assessments of need.

When there is a complex issue it does require that both CAMHS and disability services work together to make sure that the intervention is right at a point in time.

To be fair to the HSE, I always receive comprehensive replies to my questions.  I submitted a parliamentary question in September 2020, which sought the numbers on the initial assessment nationally.  The figure that came back was 13,273.  I tabled the same question in December and the same cohort had risen to 16,466.  That is a 24% increase on the numbers nationally waiting for initial assessment.  The HSE has mapped in &euro;7.8 million but in real terms, the waiting lists are increasing.  That is fact; it is based on the HSE's own figures.  In CHO 4, covering Kerry and Cork, the number of children awaiting initial assessment rose from 930 in September to 1,436 in December.  I tabled two questions, one in September and one in December.  The numbers in CHO 4 indicate 242 additional people are awaiting assessment.  Nationally, the number waiting for an initial intervention has increased by 7%.  Even if Dr. Morgan is talking about changes to community teams &ndash; we take what he is saying in good faith &ndash; in real time, the real figures show there is still an exponential increase in the waiting lists.

Reference was made to a rapid assessment and intervention for children.  To go from 100 hours in some cases to 90 minutes represents an extreme difference in the level of assessment that children are getting.  Clearly, 90 minutes is less than the time the HSE officials will be with us today.  I have four children and I know how difficult it is to get any level of interaction with them if they are feeling uncomfortable or in an unusual situation.  I imagine it would be very difficult for two clinicians to conduct the level of assessment that would be required and have a discussion with the parents in 90 minutes.<\/p><p> I know this has been raised and that other concerns have been raised.  As previously stated, the Ombudsman for Children has said that he believed it would be difficult to do the work in a 90-minute period.

It is not only the representatives of professional bodies who are saying this but the clinicians who are undertaking the work as well.  Some 95% of psychologists believe that the current system is unfit for purpose.  It is the same with occupational therapists.  Some 92% of speech and language therapists who are conducting these assessments believe that is the case as well.<\/p><p> For me, it is difficult to understand where the discrepancies are.  We have clinicians and experts saying this is not working and that it will not work for children.

We are aware of the surveys conducted by the professional organisations that the Deputy mentioned.  We are of course concerned about some of the findings.  The Deputy mentioned that 95% of psychologists responded in a particular way, for example.  Unfortunately, there were small sample sizes used by these organisations.  Also, the way in which the questions were asked were somewhat problematic.  I will be writing to each of the three organisations tomorrow expressing some of these concerns and inviting them to discuss their results because we very much want to learn from them.  If we put the three organisations together, approximately 200 people would have responded to the survey.  Recently, we did a webinar on remote assessment with clinicians from all of those organisations who are conducting assessments and interventions remotely because of the Covid-19 situation.  We had 900 people in attendance at that session and we had 1,300 in total sign up for it.  While that is certainly not a vote for or against any form of standard operating procedure, what is does reflect - this is important - is the great flexibility and willingness to approach the current situation in a creative and flexible way.<\/p><p>There is clear evidence that assessments are being done and followed up with interventions remotely.  It is very important to emphasise that the national clinical programme, which was only established last year, is a venue for all of these professions to have an opportunity to contribute directly to programme design for the first time in any clinical programme within the HSE.  They will be contributing along with service users.  There is strong user representation on our national clinical programme.  <\/p><p> In previous work I did over five years with the UN programme on the rights of people with disability, we looked at promoting structural change across more than 40 countries in terms of how to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

We often also wanted to promote the idea of a standardised approach in order that we could ensure there was an effective, efficient and equitable approach.

I am in my office in the Leinster House complex.  I thank the witnesses for their opening statement and contributions thus far.  I very much welcome the endorsement of the report of the ombudsman and the willingness to so openly embrace its recommendations.  For me, it comes down to the stories I have been told.  I refer to the constituents and others whom I have met who have experienced terrible delays or have given birth to a child with an obvious disability and yet had to go through an application process to get an assessment of needs.  There is no automatic enveloping of that parent and that child with services.  I have difficulty understanding why it is not the case that, from the moment of birth, when it becomes apparent that there is a disability, it does not trigger a system.  In the context of establishing a standard operating procedure from birth onwards, what are the impediments to having a system such as that in place?  Is the difficulty that we do not yet have a database with all of the information on it that would send up flags and trigger particular things?<\/p> <p>  People really need those supports to be pulled in around them at particular life stages, such as at birth or when disabilities become apparent as developmental stages have not been met.  There is a delay in that regard.  Some exasperated parents who have been on waiting lists for quite some time go private but their private assessment does not seem to have any effect.  I do not suggest that anyone should jump queues and not all parents can afford to go private.  However, if a parent does take that initiative, he or she gains no benefit from so doing but is exasperated while trying to get his or her child seen to.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of ensuring there is an assessment of needs with regard to access to school.  I have dealt with another issue involving schools which, bizarrely, are divided into a senior and a junior primary school.  A child may go into junior infants in the school at five years of age but between second class and third classes, the child has to apply to go to a different school that may be just across the playground from the school the child currently attends and will require another assessment of needs for that.  There is also the issue of an assessment of needs that has been carried out within the previous two years but the referral or the internal references are not sufficient.  As autism does not go away or evaporate, why can there not be a continuity of care for such children?  <\/p> <p>  I read all the terminology and the reports.  I have read the report of the previous Oireachtas joint committee on the initiation and the recommendations that arose when this standard operating procedure, SOP, was being designed.  It really about the real-life experience of people.  How should this system operate if it were operating properly?

I welcome the Senator's remarks.  This is precisely what it is we are trying to do.  The first thing to say is that the Disability Act should not be seen as the gateway to services.  That is the most important thing.  It is the very reason we are establishing the children and young people with disability networks.  When a child is born and there is a complex disability need, the mum and dad or the carer should be able to have direct contact with a network team in a defined geographical area where there is rapid intervention that stays with the child and family up to the age of 18, when he or she will move on to adult services.  We always make a distinction regarding the statutory process under the Disability Act, but we would much prefer to emphasise the children's disability network teams which parents in the situation the Senator very well described should be able to access through their GP, a public health nurse or a system of making contact.  Our teams will be up and running fully by the end of this quarter and we will be publicising that from the point of view of that in circumstances where there is a complex disability need, one should be able to make direct contact and get interdisciplinary intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal Morgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>May I cut across Dr. Morgan?

Those to whom I have spoken have told me that they gave birth and there was immediate and beautiful support in the hospital, to be fair, but that there is then silence and one must wait until applying for a medical card, for which there is a six-month delay.

Effectively, that problem originates because we have had services which are hospital-based and other services which are community-based and there has not been a connection between the two.  If a child is identified in hospital, the system should ensure that the child can be discharged from hospital and have immediate access to a community disability network team.  We and people from the paediatric side, such as the paediatric neurodisability team, are working closely together to develop models of integrated care not just between these two programmes but also with community health officers, public health nurses, general practitioners and dieticians, who were mentioned earlier and are one type of a range of various specialties.  There has definitely been a problem but we are addressing it now.

People who should be able to respond to referrals are not able to because there is a disproportionate demand on the time to do assessments.  The assessments have to be done so that they can actually result in interventions rather than just having very nice detailed assessments.  There has to be action coming from them.

She can correct me if I am wrong, but the question was on what level of investment is going into staffing out of the &euro;7.8 million.  The &euro;7.8 million is specifically to address the in excess of 6,000 overdue assessments that need to be completed.  That fund, given on a once-off basis, is specifically to address the need for additional clinicians, clinicians working overtime and accessing, in certain circumstances, private assessments.  However, the key thing is to undertake the assessments.<\/p> <p>  In the service plan in 2019, we put in more than &euro;6 million for an additional 100 posts.  These are therapy grades that have been added to the system and, in this coming year, we will again add more than &euro;6 million for an additional 100 therapy posts.  We will provide administrative support as clinicians often say their time is very caught up in completing administrative tasks.  We want to free them up, so they are focused on intervention and clinical work.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to make two other comments on staffing.  A number of years ago, the National Disability Authority said there was a basis on which we needed an additional 400 therapy posts.  That was some years ago.  We feel that the additional 200 posts, comprising 100 in the system and another 100 coming, are more than just a good start on that.  I am also conscious of the fact that the programme for Government commits to implementing the capacity review report on disability.  That provides a basis for the additional 200 posts because we provided evidence for the year-on-year investment that may be required to keep pace with need and demand, in addition to reform interventions.  The final point on staffing is that we will undertake a workforce plan later in the year on what is the optimum level of resources needed, not just now but into the future, to respond to the need that is out there.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ward made a number of important observations on the experience and involvement of parents.  Professor MacLachlan mentioned that through the establishment of the clinical programme and the work we do in supporting the autistic community, we have parents and people with lived experience on these programmes feeding into how we design better services and interventions to meet the real, lived experience of parents.  Parents, through these disability network teams, will have close contact with the network teams throughout the CHOs.  It is important to emphasise that it is more than just intervention with the child; it is also about what we call family-centred practice.  In other words, the carer or parents should be centrally involved in planning for the supports required for an individual.  That expands beyond therapeutic interventions.  It is also about providing regular access to respite and on occasion, later in life, some people do need residential support.  It is taking a holistic view on the needs of children as they move through the life cycle.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock referenced the growing number of requests for assessments via the PQ responses given to him, and their exponential rise.  Regarding the more than 6,500 that were overdue at a point in time, we are making really good progress with more than 3,000 assessments completed.  I will provide more reports to the committee on the detail of that in terms of preliminary team assessments, PTAs, and so on.  The additional therapy posts now coming into the system will make a difference to these network teams that are being stood up to do intervention work directly with children and parents.  I mentioned the capacity review report, which is referenced in the programme for Government.  That is important to us in making sure we have a plan for the year-on-year investment required.  We provided much data to help central Government and the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, who is extremely engaged, enthusiastic and energetic and was delighted to see that.  She has fought very hard for the resources we need, including the Sl&aacute;intecare reform fund and the additional &euro;100 million we got into our base budget this year.  <\/p> <p>  On the specific needs of people who are deaf or hard of hearing and, in that context, children who are in schools, what the Deputy referenced is the reconfiguration of existing clinicians working on-site within schools on a sessional basis or full time.  Two things should be kept in mind.  The idea is that children and families will be attached to a network providing interdisciplinary supports.  We expect those networks will engage and work closely with the teaching professions and school principals in their given geographical area.  That should always be there as a matter of course.  Ultimately, while keeping in mind there is a need for investment and reform, we need to ensure there is an equitable distribution of resources so we can respond to more need that is out there. <\/p> <p>  I think there was a question from Deputy Whitmore, and Senator Seery Kearney may have raised it as well, on our ICT requirements.  I did not mention it earlier but it is important to say that the reason we are not able to give sufficient granularity on data is the system we are working with is quite outdated.  It is quite an old system but we have gone to tender for a brand new system, which will help network teams.  Referencing what Professor MacLachlan said, an integrated system will help clinicians of all disciplines to work in an integrated way through a shared client database system that will give better and more sufficient granularity of detail.<\/p><p>The reason I mentioned my PQ response is there genuinely is a system.  I asked the CHOs to administratively review their cases and tell me what they are seeing in terms of the PTAs and what the outcomes are so that I can tell the committee how we have moved from assessment to intervention straightaway so I am happy to do that work.  It will mean that the CHOs and the clinicians involved will have to spend some administrative time pulling that together but it is important because we do not want to come away from this session not having instilled some confidence in what it is we are trying to do by way of reform.  I am not sure if I have missed anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal Morgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>That is okay.

Very simply, that means the length of the assessment being undertaken should be matched to the complexity of the challenges the child is presenting with.  Some people will present with challenges that are more easily identified so the priority is to get that person an intervention that can help them.  Other people will present with much more complex challenges and a broader range of assessments will need to be undertaken to identify the intervention that will be most helpful.  It is really important to say that if someone does not get an intervention after the preliminary team assessment but requires a further assessment, that is not in any shape or form a failure.  The initial assessment may result in an intervention.  It may also give the parents or the service user some reassurance, which is extremely important in this context.  Parents are consulted by the initial assessment officer and people conducting preliminary team assessments and should be consulted throughout the process because not only are they key partners in assessment, they see the long-term implications of interventions.  Some parents are extremely prepared for that and become co-therapists in terms of interventions while others have so many other demands on them that this is not realistic.

As a public service, we have a duty of care to do the least harm and the most good for the most people.  We must allocate our resources as equitably as possible.  The figure of 90 minutes is a guide and every clinician uses his or her own clinical judgment to determine what is needed for a particular child.

I will make one or two brief points, which are observations rather than questions.  This is our third meeting on this topic, and all our witnesses have been very passionate about the issue.  I am not sure if the witnesses had the opportunity to view the meeting with parents and representatives from advocacy groups.  What people said was very powerful.  As public representatives, we are all regularly contacted by parents who are trying to do their best by their children and really want to get these services.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, provision is falling down somewhere along the way.  I appreciate that the witnesses have said they accept the report of the Ombudsman for Children and want to work with it.  Reference was made to there being some level of consultation with people with lived experience but consultation must be broadened.  There must be wider consultation with the people affected, perhaps including parents.  The position might differ from CHO to CHO but speaking to people who have used the service is one of the key ways of getting things right.  I say this because the experience can be overwhelming.  Users are given a large amount of documentation.  I cannot even imagine what the situation is like now with Covid-19 but we should not fool ourselves by saying Covid is the issue.  There were issues with resources, funding and staffing before Covid.<\/p> <p>  The committee has no difficulty raising this issue when trying to advocate for additional resources.  We need to know from the HSE that resources are being used adequately, there is good consultation with service users and parents and they are not being fobbed off.  People say the service varies from region to region.  In some areas it is excellent while it is not quite so good in others.  We must try to replicate best practice in the areas where the system is working in other areas.  I hope we will see better and wider consultation processes.  I do not mean once-off consultations but monthly meetings with representative bodies to find out what is and is not working.  It is not possible to beat that type of knowledge.  I hope the witnesses will take that on board or perhaps they will comment on it now.<\/p> <p>  We want to have regular engagement with representatives of the HSE.  I accept that is difficult at the moment because meetings are limited to two hours and witnesses may feel that they are being bombarded with questions.  That is down to the time constraints we face as a result of Covid.  We would welcome regular reports and documentation as it would allow the committee to examine areas where the system is falling down, give credit in areas where it is working and identify where best practice can be replicated.  We cannot allow this situation to continue.  It is failing our children and it is not acceptable in 2021 that we still have children falling through the cracks in this way.  The committee would appreciate ongoing engagement and welcome regular reports.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on broadening feedback and consultation for parents in order to genuinely take their views on board.  The knowledge of people who have children in different services cannot be beaten.  The HSE should welcome that knowledge rather than seeing it as something negative.  I ask the witnesses to respond on any of those points or make any concluding remarks they may wish to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#K00800","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I welcome the remarks from the Chair.  She did an excellent job of summing up the key concerns.  We will provide whatever support, assistance and participation are required by this important committee by way of reports and information.<\/p> <p>  I will close by reflecting on a couple of important issues.  One concerns the involvement of parents and people with lived experience, in other words, people with disabilities.  They will have a central involvement in how we deliver better supports which meet the needs of people's real living situations.  We are already doing that, as I mentioned in regard to Professor MacLachlan's work.  I mentioned some examples regarding the autism community and the improvement programme being developed in that context.  We have parents and people with lived experience on the clinical design programme.  We are committed on a regional basis because we need not only top-down approaches but also bottom-up approaches.<\/p><p>Each of the CHOs has to establish and is committed to establishing forums which allow for participation and ensuring the parents' voice is heard.  It is important to get across that for quite some time the progressing disability service forums do include parental representatives.  We want to ensure it is happening equally and comprehensively in each of the nine regions.  We are committed to doing that and to ensuring that it genuinely allows for parents to have a real role in how we develop services and also to be critical friends.  During Covid, but also before that, parents have been under tremendous strain which is why we are committed to reform, not for its own sake but putting in real investment.  I reiterate the point that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has made huge strides in securing additional investment.  This year's budget will be &euro;2.2 billion; there is an additional &euro;100 million in our base budget, and an additional &euro;28 million once-off funding to deal with the assessment of need backlog but also for the transforming lives scheme, which aims to help services change how they do business, give additional resources in important areas such as access to equipment and also access to intervention programmes.  That is making a real difference.<\/p><p> I mentioned the programme for Government which commits to working towards implementing the capacity report.  That is critical for us in the context of looking at a longer-term approach in investment in disability services insofar as we make sure we do the necessary reforms to meet the conditions of the UN convention.  I cannot emphasise that enough. <\/p><p> We really welcome today, we have been looking forward to it.  We are very much committed to ensuring that the committee gets all the information it needs not only around policy but, as I said in my opening statement, welcoming the Ombudsman's report.

My apologies that I was not here for everything due to the two meetings coinciding.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make one point which I have made before at the committee.  I was a primary school teacher up to 12 months ago.  I am hugely concerned about many children attending primary school, particularly children with special needs, at the moment.  In recent weeks they have been taught via Zoom, Teams, Seesaw and other online platforms, however some of the other supports that would be typically available during the school year, such as the HSE psychological supports and CAMHS, were not available online.  Can someone here respond to that?  If teachers, SNAs and other providers of children's needs were able to sit in front of a laptop with a camera and microphone and engage with them, the support agencies should have been able to do that too.

We have all been struggling with the lack of normal access to services, whether through disability network teams, primary care teams or the CAMHS and mental health services.<\/p> <p>  First, remote working undoubtedly does not work for everyone.  There is specific guidance for clinicians on this - it is on the website - that where on-site therapeutic interventions can be conducted in a safe way, we try to do that.  Second, I understand that the Deputy was attending another committee, but earlier I spoke of how the children's network teams that have been established must continue to work very closely with school principals and educators, teachers, as well as parents in meeting the needs of children who have additional support needs in education settings.  Third, we work closely with the National Council for Special Education.  We have a regular forum and engagement with it to ensure we work in an integrated way.  It is an education initiative, but the programme for Government commits to in-school therapeutic resources and supports.  That is being driven through the Department of Education.  The HSE is concentrating on the establishment and resourcing of children's disability network teams that must and will continue to work closely with our colleagues in the education sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021030200002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal Morgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I will conclude by saying that if Joe Wicks, the YouTuber, was able to go online and do jumping jacks and deliver a physiotherapy programme, if one likes, for young people with difficulties, from his living room in London and reach young Irish people across the country, then surely those on the HSE payroll should have been doing something similar.<\/p> <p>  There is huge frustration, including among parents with whom I would have engaged as a teacher 12 months ago about supports.

As the Chair has outlined, I will share my time with the Minister of State.  We are joined by a number of departmental officials.  With me in Kildare House are Mr. Dalton Tattan, Ms Aoife Conduit, Ms Yvonne Keating, Ms Anne Tansey and Mr. Neville Kenny while, remotely, Ms Deirdre Shanley, Ms Martina Mannion and Mr. Hubert Loftus are joining us from Athlone and Tullamore .<\/p> <p>  The committee in its invitation has set out an ambitious list of topics to discuss today, many of which have seen considerable developments in recent weeks.  These include the return of students to in-person learning as well as arrangements for the State examinations in 2021.  As Deputies and Senators know, yesterday saw the return of approximately 320,000 students to their classrooms, 60,000 of whom are the leaving certificate class of 2021, and approximately 260,000 in the first four years of primary school.  This was a hugely positive day for many students, their families and school staff and one which has been much anticipated.  Importantly, yesterday also saw special schools return to full in-class provision having operated on the basis of 50% attendance since 11 February.  In addition, special classes at primary and post-primary level have been operating at full capacity since 22 February. <\/p> <p>  Over the next number of weeks, we hope to see even more students return to school, including 260,000 primary school students in the more senior classes on 15 March together with fifth year students at post-primary level.  Subject to continued progress in maintaining reduced community transmission levels, the remaining post-primary students will return to school on 12 April following the traditional Easter break.  <\/p> <p>  We have made progress over recent weeks in returning to classrooms.  The phased approach, which has been building on the earlier phases when special schools and special classes reopened, has been possible with the progress made across communities in bringing the community transmission levels of Covid-19 down.  We certainly need to maintain our efforts to contain the virus and I welcome the deputy chief medical officer, CMO's, advice to school communities and, more generally, that we must maintain our vigilance so that we can get all of our students back to in-school person provision.  <\/p> <p>  Yesterday saw the return of the leaving certificate year students to their classrooms.  They return with the clarity and choice that the recent Government decision on the approach to be taken to their leaving certificate examination provided.  The work undertaken by the members of the advisory group on the State examinations in the lead-up to the Government decision was very beneficial in ensuring all voices could be heard and could input into the deliberations.  The work in ensuring that students can choose to sit an examination, or avail of an accredited grade, continues intensively within my Department and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, and will involve continued engagement with the education partners.<\/p> <p>  Deputies and Senators will be aware that a document entitled, A Guide to State Examinations and Accredited Grades for Leaving Certificate 2021, was issued by my Department last week and it provides a useful outline to students, their families and schools as to how the examination process and the accredited grades process will work.  There will be significant further information and guidance issued to students and schools over the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  There are differences to the arrangements in 2021 when compared to last year.  A full suite of examinations operated by the SEC will be run, starting with the oral and practical components in the coming weeks, subject to prevailing public health advice.  The examinations will take place in line with their traditional June timetable and that timetable has been published.  In addition, the accredited grades system this year will be ultimately completed by the SEC with my Department carrying out the preliminary stages of the work pending necessary legislative amendments.  I intend to bring proposals for relevant legislative amendments to Cabinet shortly and to seek to have the relevant provisions drafted as a priority.  I will also seek the assistance of this committee in ensuring the relevant Bill can progress through the required legislative Stages as expeditiously as possible.  <\/p> <p>  Across both Houses, I am sure we are united in the view that we want to see our leaving certificate class of 2021 progress to the next stage of their lives in as normal a fashion as possible, acknowledging the challenges that they and the education system as a whole have faced.  <\/p> <p>  The third principal area that the committee had highlighted for discussion today was in its report, The Impact of Covid-19 on Primary and Secondary Education.  I have read the report, including its recommendations, and to highlight the pace at which events have unfolded since the report was published in January, many of the recommendations in regard to the reopening of schools or the leaving certificate have been, or are being, addressed.  We are also making progress in the other areas which the report focussed on and I am happy to provide any updates on the recommendations committee members may wish to discuss as we work through the session.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I acknowledge the work undertaken across school communities in recent weeks and particularly in the lead-up to yesterday in ensuring many students are now back in their classrooms with their teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and support staff.  I look forward to seeing all students back in their classrooms over the coming weeks.  I invite the Minister of State to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#A00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Is c&uacute;is &aacute;thais dom a bheith anseo inniu.

I recognise the work of all these groups in dealing with the difficulties created by Covid-19.  Our education system, as we know, is built on partnership and when everyone works together then all obstacles can be overcome.<\/p><p>It is well established that remote learning is particularly challenging for students with additional needs and there is a risk of regression and loss of key skills.  While additional supports can make a difference, nothing will replace the effectiveness of in-person, in-school education.  It was for this reason the Government was determined that special education would be given priority in terms of support and school reopening.<\/p><p> Special schools were prioritised to reopen on 11 February on a 50% attendance basis.  All special classes returned to in-school learning on a full-time basis from 22 February.  Special schools returned to full-time in-school education yesterday, 1 March.  It was a significant and welcome development which saw more than one third of primary schools and one quarter of post-primary schools open for children with special education needs in special classes, in advance of any return to mainstream education.<\/p><p> As part of the living with Covid-19 plan, NPHET has recommended a phased and cautious return to school over the coming weeks.  Work will continue to ensure that all students with special education needs in mainstream school can return to the classroom.  It is essential that as a society we continue to make progress in curbing the spread of the disease to allow all of our children to return to school as quickly as possible.  The whole school community is working, including updated public health guidance and a framework document which outlines temporary time bound staffing arrangements, the application of substitution arrangements, time bound temporary arrangements for pupil attendance, information on school transport options, childcare provision and other matters.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Foley, all in government, our officials and I are aware the return to classrooms for students with additional needs and their families is much more than just a return to learning.  We are aware that some families and school staff still have concerns about the return.  All of the decisions made by Government over the past year have been about meeting the twin aims of protecting public health and delivering essential services such as education in the most appropriate way for all students.  In politics, we may not always agree but I know all committee members are united in wanting to see our country emerge from Covid-19 restrictions successfully and as soon as possible.<\/p><p> In recognising that pupils with additional needs can find it harder to engage in remote learning, the Department has also put in place a supplementary support scheme to provide for some home based one-to-one support for such pupils.  The supplementary programme for eligible pupils in third to sixth class will be extended by a further two weeks or an additional ten hours.  Schools have been asked to prioritise deployment of their special education teaching, SET, resources to facilitate the engagement of pupils with special education needs, SEN, in third to sixth class.  This will necessitate further collaboration between the special education teachers, SETs, and class teachers to establish current priority learning needs among those pupils.<\/p><p> I am determined to ensure an enhanced summer programme for children with special educational needs in summer 2021, as successfully happened last year.  This programme provided a strong foundation to support students in advance of their return to in-school learning in September 2020 following the long summer break.  It also allowed schools and staff to identify and address educational regression in students so as to make the transition back to school easier for these students and their families.<\/p><p> Since my appointment, we have successfully run that expanded summer provision programme, secured a record &euro;2 billion budget for special education, opened a new special school, provided the resources for the creation of 1,200 additional special class places next year and worked to put special education first as part of school reopening.  We know that challenges remain and I am determined to tackle these.  As I said, I am happy to be here today to engage with the committee, to hear its perspectives on those issues and provide updates or further information where we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#A00600","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.

One of the key concerns for school staff is that if a Covid-19 case arises, it be dealt with swiftly and decisively and that we rid the school of it as quickly as possibly.  Significantly scaling up testing and tracing is crucial to that.  I refer to a specific element of that.  I noted in an article in yesterday's<i>The Irish Times<\/i>that an expert group reporting to NPHET is likely to recommend the use of antigen testing in school settings, which would be complementary to PCR and not a substitute for it.  Has the Department considered what role antigen testing can play in schools in making them as safe as possible?  If NPHET recommends its use, on foot of the expert report, will antigen testing be used in schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#B00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta as ucht an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite aige &oacute; thaobh na Roinne agus mhuintir na scoile.

I ask that the Minister of State answers as briefly as possible.  Parents of children with additional educational needs in mainstream feel they have been forgotten by the Department.  At a previous meeting, I said that Sinn F&eacute;in wanted a phased return and special education should be the number one priority.  That seemed to be the view of the Department, despite the difficulties.  However, from the Minister of State's statement, and from what is happening, those children do not seem to be a priority.  There does not seem to be any mention of priority for children with additional needs in secondary schools.  Does the Minister of State think it is right that a student in first or second year with additional needs would have to wait until 12 April, almost six weeks from now, before they can get back into the classroom?  There must be some way to get them in-school support in advance of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#B00700","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire might be aware that approximately 1.5% of children internationally have special education needs, SEN.  It is the same in Ireland.  They are the children with the most complex needs.  Approximately 8,500 children with special education needs, SEN, are in primary school and approximately 4,500 of those are back.  Approximately 4,000 who are in third to sixth class are not yet back.  As I said in my opening statement, special education teaching, SET, is prioritising the children in those years.<\/p> <p>  Other children with special education needs, SEN, with less complicated needs, are integrated into a mainstream class.  Many of them are high impact, low incidence, such as dyslexia.  They were never envisaged as the first cohort, as a priority, as they are well integrated into mainstream.<\/p><p>According to the Department and following agreement with education stakeholders, part of the rationale for that is that it is in the best interests of these children to come back as part of mainstream because they are so well integrated into mainstreams.  There are approximately 10,000 children with SENs who will return to full classes in due course with all other students.  The other rationale, of course, is the cautious phased approach that NPHET has recommended.  It remains my absolute intention for all children with SENs to get back to school as soon as possible.  We have the supplementary programme, which I have mentioned, to support these children in the interim and we have extended the supplementary programme for a further two weeks for children in third to sixth classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#B00800","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I am afraid I must interrupt the Minister of State in order to ask my final question.

It is a pity that they have had to wait so long.  Some of them have to wait for six weeks.<\/p> <p>  My final question is for the Minister, Deputy Foley.  There are many issues still to be resolved with the leaving certificate.  Clarity is needed on course work, mock examinations and music practicals.  One thing I cannot understand is if students who decide to sit the exam are, for whatever reason, unable to do so, they will not get a second chance even though the availability of a paper B in the case of illness or bereavement has been built into the system for many years.  I do not understand that decision.  I refer to replies received to parliamentary questions.  Is it the case that, for example, if Cork or Kildare goes into a localised county lockdown in June, all students in the affected county would lose the option of sitting a written exam?  That seems to me to be removing the choice from students.  If they follow public health advice in the context of having to self-isolate or a localised lockdown, they will not have the chance to sit the exams for which they prepared so hard.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that decision.  Can she confirm whether students will be given a second chance to sit the written exams in the case of a localised county level 5 lockdown?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#C00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>We are running out of time.

Those are the two options that are being provided for students.  In the midst of a pandemic, it is a fair option.  It allows students the opportunity to choose one or both and it makes provision from a public health point of view as well in terms of what may happen going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#C00400","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We are here today to speak in particular about the reopening of schools and that being done in a safe and sustainable manner.  It is great to see that special schools are reopening at full capacity this week and that junior infants, senior infants, first classes and second classes have come back at primary school level.  A clear map has been provided.  An outline has been issued whereby students will return to school on 8 March, 15 March, 29 March and 12 April, by which stage all students will have fully returned to school.  That is a provisional schedule which depends on good public health guidelines being maintained and the numbers coming down.

I welcome the commitment to the summer provision programme.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to the principals of several secondary schools last week.

First year students have not had the opportunities that students would normally have in terms of exploring their schools.

It would also be of assistance on the counselling side of things for first years coming into school.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for the Minister, Deputy Foley.  Does she have any update for schools in respect of air monitors and meters?  On leaving certificate reform, is there any update on the senior cycle review advisory report?  We have a great opportunity to consider the review of the leaving certificate and, potentially, ways to use continuous assessment to better effect. <\/p> <p>  Finally, I was very fortunate to have an opportunity yesterday to raise the issue of a school in my local area.  I represent Roscommon and Galway.  I refer to the DEIS band 1 school in Ballinasloe, which does not meet the current requirements in terms of classroom space and size.  The school is awaiting a new school building.  Will school building projects be accelerated?

In terms of air monitors and the whole question of ventilation and so on, significant guidance was issued to schools when they returned in September.  Updated guidance was provided at the end of November or in early December.  As I stated, there was significant review of all mitigation measures pertaining to schools in advance of the recent return to school.  The advice under the current approved guidelines is that windows should be open before class and at the end of class and, at a minimum, during class.  At very best, school staff should use their best experience.  Having worked in classrooms, I am conscious that there is excellent expertise available within schools in that regard.  However, I acknowledge that a high-level advisory expert group is looking at areas of ventilation not just within the school setting, but in other settings as well.  It is due to make its findings known in the not-too-distant future.  If there is a specific recommendation for any new or additional mitigation measures, then we will certainly adapt, as we always have, in the context of any new issues or new measures that we are asked to put in place.<\/p> <p>  On the senior cycle review, to the best of my information, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently finalising its report.  I look forward to the report insofar as it is likely to form the basis for further discussion, as well as, ultimately, for decision making.  The Senator is correct that there is a new light shining on the senior cycle, given the current environment in which we are living.  I await that report.  <\/p> <p>  On the specific issue she raised of a DEIS band 1 school in her constituency and the schools building programme, we are progressing apace with the school building programme.

It is something we all sought and spoke about within the committee confines.  We sent a request to the Minister indicating that was what was needed.  The outcome is much appreciated, taking on board the views of everyone involved within the education world.  It is certainly the best possible solution.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that the roadmap to schools fully reopening has started.  I have a slight concern for those between first and third years in secondary school because it is still over a month before they will have the opportunity to return to school.  Will the Minister look at those who cannot sit the junior certificate this year and who will be going into a transition year programme?  I think the transition year programme will need to be looked at for the next school year in terms of a little catch-up with the world of academia.  The Minister might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I have some concern for those children who come from more vulnerable backgrounds.  We need to support them in transitioning back into school.  I know in some cases they have not really transitioned from September to Christmas.  I know the Minister is looking at advancing DEIS supports and the school completion programme, which is important work.  I am glad that has come back to the Department of Education.  The Minister might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  The committee is examining the issue of school bullying and the impact on mental health.  Does the Minister have comments on that?  That comes back to mental health supports for students, especially for those coming back into school having had difficult experiences because of bereavement through Covid-19 or having had to mind siblings when parents were working, etc.<\/p> <p>  My last point relates to the schools building programme.  I am delighted to see so much progress.  I am glad one of the schools to benefit will be St. Paul's Secondary School in Monasterevin.  As the Minister knows, I always take the opportunity to ask about the new build that is badly needed at secondary level in the Newbridge and Kildare areas.  They are the particular points I wish to raise.  The Minister said there would be a review of the school transport scheme.  Any update on that from the Minister would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#D00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>In the first instance, I will address the question on students from first year to third year.  In the broader mix, and with the best will in the world, I would love to have all students back in one go, but that is not possible in the current circumstances living with Covid-19.  The recommendation based on the expert advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team is that we would take what the deputy chief medical officer has called a cautious and phased approach to reopening our schools.  For this reason, we are limited to the manner in which we have reopened the schools.  We are hopeful that community transmission can be kept under control.  I acknowledge that there is a burden of responsibility on all of us within the community to ensure we progress positively.  If we continue to progress positively, we will see the successful reopening on the other dates, including 15 March and 12 April, respectively.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referenced the transition year programme.  I acknowledge that reconfigured or new guidelines issued this year for the transition year programme and how it could operate in our schools.  We will be cognisant of the need to look at specific programmes like that.  We will be cognisant of the need for measures to make time for learning that has been lost.  All of that will come in due course.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about DEIS supports and supports for children with particular challenges in that respect.  I am conscious of that and of the importance of supporting children who experience disadvantage.  A total of 887 schools are in the DEIS programme and they cater to more than 185,000 students.  Committee members may be aware that we made an announcement on the 1-point reduction in class size in urban DEIS band 1 primary schools.  Reference was made to the school completion programme.  We have looked at introducing measures whereby we can now extend the school completion programme to include 14 urban primary and 14 post-primary DEIS schools.  There is also a 5% increase in funding for school completion programmes.<\/p> <p>  From the point of view of educational disadvantage, we have introduced a measure to reduce enrolment in DEIS post-primary schools from 700 to 600.  This would allow for qualification for an additional deputy principal within those schools.<\/p> <p>  Tied up with that is the reference made to well-being, which is highly important in the education sector.  We have a strong well-being policy in the Department.  In our most recent budget we made funding available for an additional 110 guidance counsellors and 17 additional National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists.  I confirm that NEPS is continuing to work on a parallel basis with schools.  In addition to its online work, on-site visits have commenced as well.  We are conscious that in the context of well-being at the start of the year a strong emphasis was placed on the return to school and how it would affect the well-being of students as they returned.  That continues as students return.  Throughout the entire school year, there is a strong focus on well-being from that point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#D00600","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to conclude because we have gone well over seven and a half minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#D00700","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>My thanks to the Cathaoirleach, the Minister and the Minister of State for joining us again today.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate all school staff and all those across all schools on ensuring we can have safe reopening of schools and giving some clarity around the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to mention the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, and the amount of work those involved have undertaken.  It is welcome that we have choice available now.  I know it has not been easy so it is important for all of us to recognise the amount of work that has gone into that.  Obviously, there are still questions outstanding in respect of out-of-school learners.  I know that is something the ISSU would like to have clarity around.

I, along with every committee member, made representations for that class size reduction in primary, secondary and vertical schools.  The move is very welcome.  While my constituency might not have DEIS urban band 1 schools, there is still an amount of disadvantage there.  We are going to potentially see an expanding divide.  As Senator O'Loughlin outlined, those children from first year to third and fourth year will have been out of school for a significant amount of time.  There are children with disadvantage across all schools.  Will we be looking at increasing home school liaison, for instance, in order to make sure that over the coming years that the disadvantage these children may be feeling now does not become a problem as they approach the junior and leaving certificates?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#D00800","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I endorse the Senator's remarks about ISSU, the Irish Second-Level Students Union.

They gave so much of their own time, whether they were representatives of parents, teachers, students, managerial bodies or SNAs.<\/p> <p>  There will certainly be an accommodation for out-of-school learners.  A process is being developed with regards to giving access to them to the absolutely maximum extent possible.  That was an issue last year but we are most determined that measures will be put in place to accommodate them.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, due to the fact that exams would have to be run in parallel, from a public health point of view, it would not have been possible to run both junior certificate and leaving certificate exams at the one time.

Those movements were welcomed by all.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the certainty the recent decision on the leaving certificate has given to the 60,000 leaving certificate students impacted by the pandemic, school closures and the lack of in-class tuition.  Three different choices are being offered to those students, and I anticipate that will cause some organisational and management difficulties in our schools.  Has the Department looked at the possibility of recruiting extra teachers temporarily to ensure our students have the optimum benefit in this regard?  I say that because many of these students have been adversely impacted.  They missed five months of in-class teaching last year and then two months of this academic year.  Some level of support must be provided to these students.  Has any planning been done in this area?<\/p> <p>  This development will also create problems by overburdening class teachers who will be trying to deal with three cohorts of students in one classroom.  Some students will sit the traditional leaving certificate, some will avail of accredited grades and others will choose a combination of those two options.  Stress, difficulties and pressures will ensue.

Are there plans in place to address any problems which may result?<\/p> <p>  The report of the joint committee which examined the impact of Covid-19 on primary level education identified a disparity in funding for primary and second level schools and in school leadership posts.

Has an assessment been made of the short-term funding needs of schools at primary and second levels in respect of allowing the safe and continued reopening of those schools?  <\/p> <p>  My final question focuses on the possibility of future school closures and the likelihood of some students being forced to self-isolate or restrict their movements.  Has consideration been given to the development of an online learning programme to include supports for disadvantaged students in accessing digital services and adequate broadband?  That is an issue for many communities throughout the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#J01000","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":531,"content":"<p>On the matter of the provision of additional resources in schools, especially for leaving certificate students, it must be acknowledged that we were more cognisant of that issue as we moved forward in our planning this year.  More than 1,000 additional posts were made available for second level schools.  That has been a major increase in support in our schools.<\/p> <p>  On teachers being overburdened and potentially having to deal with a cohort of students wishing to take the written exams in June and another cohort opting for the accredited grades process, we were mindful of trying to accommodate both those groups within a class.  That is to take nothing away from the superb efforts made by teachers via remote learning and the huge demands now being placed on teachers in person.  Operating in a Covid-19 environment is difficult; I fully accept that.<\/p><p>In an effort to accommodate that, in the case of the accredited grades process, estimated marks and all associated information will not be uploaded by teachers until quite significantly into the month of May.  That will afford students the opportunity to continue their learning, whether they are opting for the written examinations in June or the accredited grades process, and for teachers to continue their teaching.  There will not be a conflict in terms of the need for students to be wholly involved in the learning processes within the classroom.  That accommodation of extending the date for the provision of estimated grades as late as possible is very helpful.<\/p><p> Regarding the issues of funding set out in the committee's report, it is important to acknowledge that significant capitation funding has gone into schools over the past two years or so.  There are two types of capitation funding, namely, funding for the day-to-day running of schools and the ancillary grant.  Last year, there was a 2.5% increase in the capitation budget, which followed a 5% increase in 2019.  In addition to that increase, significant funding was poured into schools to cover all the additional measures that are required this year in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.  That is necessary to ensure that certain schools would not be at a disadvantage and that all of them would be able to meet the challenge of the crisis equally.  It is significant funding, as I said, and includes &euro;56 million made available for PPE, hand sanitiser and so on and &euro;34.7 million for enhanced cleaning in schools.<\/p><p> In terms of the disparity the Deputy mentioned between primary and post-primary schools, it is self-evident that there is a very definite difference between primary schools and second level on a unit base level, in that post-primary school buildings are larger and have a smaller pupil-teacher ratio and more specialist rooms.  There is a higher cost at post-primary for heating, lighting, cleaning etc.  The disparity that exists reflects all of those specific issues.<\/p><p> On the question of the need for additional assistant principal I, AP1, posts, an announcement was made yesterday regarding posts within the DEIS scheme, where the threshold requirement for the appointment of a deputy principal has reduced from 700 pupils to 600.  That is a very positive step forward for DEIS schools.  The provision of leadership posts and posts of responsibility in schools is kept under constant review and is regularly the subject of discussions with school staff and representatives.  We will continue to do that and, as I said, we have made significant strides in regard to DEIS schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#J01100","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":533,"content":"<p>Dearbha&iacute;m go bhfuil m&eacute; i dTeach Laighean faoi l&aacute;thair.

I commend them on the fact that schools have started the process of reopening.  As they know, I share the view of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Muldoon, that all schools should be open, that the policies we are implementing at present are damaging to children and that when we come to look back on this time with the benefit of hindsight, children will say they were let down by adults during this period.  Nevertheless, I commend the fact that the process of reopening has begun.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in respect of children with additional needs, after which I will put a question to the Minister, Deputy Foley.  Last Friday, I met parents of children with additional educational needs who are in mainstream national schools.  Those children, who are in second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes, will not be going back to school until Monday week.  The parents are very concerned that their children with special educational needs have been discriminated against compared with children with similar needs in special schools, who are already back.  I said to them that I would emphasise to both the Minister of State and the Minister the importance of trying to ensure that we get children with special educational needs back to school as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  A question that was raised with me by the parents was whether the supplementary support scheme that is operating can be regarded as appropriate in circumstances where there are special needs assistants going from one house to another.  They made the valid point that this appears to be even more questionable from a public health point of view than what would be happening if children were back in school.  They asked me to emphasise that from their point of view, the supplementary support scheme is not working.  Is there anything the Minister of State can say to alleviate the concerns of these parents regarding the supplementary support scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#K00400","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I share his concern about the possibility of regression for children with special needs.  Fortunately, children in special schools and special classes are now back full time, as well as junior infants up to second class.  On 15 March, the other classes will also be back.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the supplementary programme, it is a voluntary scheme that is open to all students in special schools and classes, including those with the greatest need.  It provides a maximum of five hours per week, for four weeks, of one-to-one teaching and learning in the home outside of school time.  One of the issues we are looking at and on which we are working with the education partners is the fact that the support is provided in the evenings and at weekends.  We hope to be in a position to provide a supplementary programme within the school setting.  We spent &euro;30 million on PPE for teachers last year, and will spend the same this year, and they are working with very small numbers.  Like any decision the Department makes, this arrangement is based on public health advice.  We would not be putting forward a programme in the first instance if we did not have the safety of the children and families involved at the forefront of our consideration.  I hope that has provided some clarity for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#K00500","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Can she offer an assurance to those students and their parents that if things improve, the return date will be kept under review?  The Minister would acknowledge that children have been damaged by not being back at school.  Public health advice is paramount but we also have to take into account the health concerns of children, which include not just physical health concerns but the other health concerns associated with their development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#K00600","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I acknowledge it as an indisputable fact that students are best served when they are in school.  Notwithstanding that, we are living in the reality of a Covid-19 pandemic in which all of society in this country, within reason, is closed down.  It is a significant endorsement of the importance of education in Irish society that education and childcare are the only sectors open during the current restrictions.  When we reopened the schools in September last year and there was uninterrupted learning through to December, we closely followed the public health advice and the input of NPHET.  In this instance, the latter has advised that it is looking for a cautious and phased return to school.  While I would wish that we were in a position to have more children and young people in school, it is on the basis of the advice from NPHET that we are proceeding as we are.<\/p><p>It is worth making the point that when schools were stood down, as I stated earlier, it was because of the mobility of 1.1 million people.  Schools in themselves are seen as places of low transmission, and this has been echoed on a number of occasions and as late as this past weekend by Professor Philip Nolan, the deputy chief medical officer and others.  It is, of course, our absolute agenda that schools would further reopen on 15 March and again on 12 April.  However, there is a burden of responsibility being placed on all of society to ensure that can happen.  The deputy chief medical officer has made it very clear that we must continue to see improvements and numbers coming down.  We must see hospitalisations decreasing and we have seen very good news on that again today.  Society must invest in this instance to ensure our schools can reopen fully and as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#K00700","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I will start with a few questions for the Minister, Deputy Foley.  I heard the word \"equal\" six or seven times from the Minister's notes but it is not a word we should be throwing around when we know it is not true.  I say this with much emotion because there are so many schools in Ireland that do not have equal funding and which are struggling.  These are very disadvantaged schools, one of which is Our Lady of the Wayside in Bluebell, Dublin 12.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the disadvantage experienced by children who have not had equal access to the education system during the pandemic because they have no technology, such as phones.  I know of one case involving a woman who must go to a school every Monday at 1 p.m. to get her children's homework.  There is another family sharing one iPhone.  I have been very vocal about the digital divide for many weeks and it is not something we need to look at during the pandemic.  As we will need to look at it in future, what has the Department done to bridge the digital divide?  I would appreciate an answer on this because it is everything but equal access when children do not have the technology to access school material.  How can the Minister guarantee the calculated grades will not be prejudiced towards marginalised communities or bias against people from ethnic minority groups?  I would appreciate a reply on that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke about research and unless I am wrong, the Minister said that remote learning is easier this time around.

The Senator spoke about the digital divide and I am very conscious of it.  In the past year alone and throughout the pandemic, over &euro;100 million in financial resources have been made available to schools specifically with regard to information, communication and digital technology, etc.  This was to afford schools the opportunity to purchase digital platforms or, as I have seen in the vast majority of schools, necessary equipment.  As late as December 2020, &euro;50 million was expedited to schools so they would have funding available for the purchase of digital equipment, including tablets and laptops.  A variety of schools have purchased equipment that is loaned to students and which students have utilised throughout the pandemic.  I regard this as a very positive use of the funds made available.  If there are specific cases of this not happening or not being possible for whatever reason in different schools, I am keen to be made aware of them.  As I have said, substantial funding has been made available and used in that respect in a variety of schools.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to the accredited grades system and indicated that it should not disadvantage young people from different backgrounds or marginalised or minority backgrounds.  It was the experience in the system last year that it was blind to gender, background etc.<\/p> <p>  I indicated that remote learning is working more successfully this year than it did last year.  The closure of schools was sudden last year and there was a lack of preparedness because it was so unexpected, and one can understand that.  This year considerable work was done with schools, including the publication of guidelines that were worked through with all the partners in education, including teacher representatives, managerial bodies and students.  Everybody was around the table working out the guidelines and platforms to be used by schools, as well as the contact required between parents and schools.  All those guidelines were agreed and the platforms were put in place.  That is exactly what I meant with respect to the preparedness for remote learning working better this year than it did last year.  Is this going to work perfectly in all cases?  That is absolutely not a guarantee that can be given and there will always be difficulties.  As I stated, it is in no way a replacement for in-person teaching and learning.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about funding being made available for catching up.  Again, I have said that I am conscious of particular cohorts of students being especially disadvantaged because of Covid-19.  I have said it is my intention to make enhanced summer schemes available this year, as we had last year, with a focus on numeracy and literacy.  The Senator is aware that yesterday I announced a further expansion of the school completion programme, which is of enormous benefit to many students.  A further 28 schools are to be included in that programme.  There is also to be an increase in funding for school completion programmes and the DEIS schools will see a one point reduction in class sizes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021030200002#L00700","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>Some other members, including me, want to ask some questions as well.

I raised the issue of vice principals in primary schools with the Minister on a previous occasion and I am aware it was also raised with the unions.  I refer in particular to schools which have no permanent deputy principal.  Secondary schools may have 300 or 400 students and a full-time deputy principal.  A primary school could have 700, 800 or 900 pupils but no permanent deputy principal post.  Has the Minister had any time to examine this?

I am joined by the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement and eGovernment, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and a number of our officials.<\/p> <p>  The group comprises a significant number of Votes, as the Chairman outlined, including: Vote 11 - the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances; the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department, including the State Laboratory - Vote 14, the Public Appointments Service - Vote 17, the National Shared Services Office - Vote 18 - and the Office of the Ombudsman - Vote 19; Vote 15 - the Secret Service; Vote 39 - the Office of Government Procurement ; and Vote 43 - the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is happy to address issues relating to the Office of Government Procurement and the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer, and I will address questions regarding the other Votes.<\/p> <p>  I note that a detailed briefing has been supplied by my Department's officials, who were assisted in this task by their colleagues in a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department.  Further detailed material is also contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2021, which was prepared by my Department.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has presented unprecedented challenges to officials, Members of this House and the general public.  Arrangements for business continuity and flexible working have ensured that essential public services can continue to be delivered, while also ensuring that the general principles of safety, health and welfare are adhered to.  Officials from my Department, and in bodies under the Department's aegis, have played a central role in responding to the challenges of this crisis, and I take this opportunity to thank all parties involved for their collective efforts in this regard.<\/p> <p>  In an overall context, the 2021 total gross allocation for the public expenditure and reform, PER, group of Votes comprising of nine distinct Votes shows an increase of 3% on the 2020 allocation.  The overall gross figure for 2021 is approximately &euro;858 million compared with &euro;829 million in 2020.  This is largely driven by an increased Estimate provision to Vote 12, targeted minor increases to enable the delivery of essential services such as additional HSE recruitment, and to meet the additional salary costs associated with the Public Service Stability Agreement.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on the individual Votes in a little more detail.  The structure of Vote 11, the PER Vote, remains unchanged in 2021, with two strategic programmes focused on the two main strategy goals of the Department, namely, to manage public expenditure at sustainable levels in a planned, balanced and evidence informed manner in order to support Ireland's economic, social and climate goals and to drive reform and innovation across the civil and public service to improve services to the public and enhance strategic policymaking and public governance structures.  The Department has kept its overall 2021 budget flat and has reallocated resources across a number of expenditure subheads to meet 2021 priorities.<\/p> <p>  The most significant changes to programme subhead budgets are as follows.  Subhead A9 funding for pensions for bodies under the aegis of the Department increased by &euro;700,000 to &euro;1,150,000.  This will assist with additional pensions costs incurred by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Institute of Public Administration, IPA.  Subhead A3, the ESRI grant subhead, has increased by &euro;225,000 to &euro;3,000,000 to support the institute in carrying out additional social research in 2021.  The allocations for subheads A8 and B5, the programme consultancy subheads, have reduced by &euro;383,000 in total.  Subhead B7, the reform agenda subhead, was reduced by &euro;542,000 to &euro;648,000, which is sufficient to meet its requirements this year.<\/p> <p>  In relation to other Votes, the Estimate for Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances, which is the largest Vote, accounts for the vast majority of the envisaged increase in PER Vote group expenditure in 2021.  Year-to-year variations in the expenditure of this Vote are primarily driven by the number of pensioners on the payroll, the number of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age and whose years of service and grade or pay level are variable and uncertain.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate I am proposing today for Vote 12, involving a gross provision of &euro;666.268 million, represents an increase of just over &euro;26 million, or 4%, on the 2020 gross Estimate.  This increase reflects an increase in the number of pensioners on the payroll and the number of civil servants reaching retirement age in the year.<\/p> <p>  Other bodies under the aegis of the Department, such as the Public Appointments Service, PAS, the National Shared Services Office, NSSO, and the State Laboratory, provide important services to large numbers of clients across the civil and public service.  A modest increase to the State Laboratory's 2021 Estimate will allow the laboratory to meet additional forecasted demand for tariff classification advice in 2021, and also enable the laboratory to provide an analytical service to the HSE in relation to e-cigarettes.  The Public Appointments Service - Vote 17 - has received a modest once-off increase in the current year to assist the HSE with increased recruitment demand arising from the pandemic.  The NSSO has played an important role in the reform of public services in recent years through the delivery of human resource shared services and payroll shared services to clients across the civil and public service.<\/p><p>The 2021 NSSO allocation will enable the continued provision of HR and payroll shared services and also enable the office to progress the roll-out of financial management shared services.<\/p><p> The Estimate provision for the Office of the Ombudsman will allow the various constituent offices to deal with their respective workloads and enable continued investment in ICT modernisation, which will support the office to meet the challenges of delivering essential services to the public remotely at this time.<\/p><p> Procurement is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s public service reform agenda.  The State procures goods and services costing in the region of &euro;8.5 billion each year.  In this context, it is essential that the public service operates in a co-ordinated and efficient way and delivers sustainable savings for the taxpayer.  Some of the key OGP initiatives supported by the 2021 Estimate include: improving procurement capability in the public service; further developing, implementing and actioning a medium-term strategy for construction procurement, including the capital works management framework, CWMF; supporting Future Jobs Ireland and the climate action plan through focused procurement policy initiatives; the development of a new national eTenders system; and the delivery of commercial skills training across the public service.  <\/p><p> Finally, 2021 marks the second year of the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer, OGCIO, as an independent Vote - Vote 43.  It was established in 2020 with an Estimate of &euro;21.7 million net, all of which came from Exchequer neutral funding transfers from other Votes.  The Estimate for 2021 will rise by 5%, which is largely funded via Exchequer neutral transfers of &euro;1.1 million from other public sector bodies.  This Vote serves to drive the digital transformation agenda across Government while providing and developing pan-public service ICT infrastructure, service delivery models and cross-government applications.  The OGCIO is facilitating a sustained and wider spread adoption of the build to share suite of services as set out in the public service ICT strategy and endorsed by the Civil Service Management Board, CSMB, with Departments contributing to the funding of services received.  This approach to Exchequer-neutral funding means that ICT costs can be suppressed across the wider system as a result of labour specialisation, economies of scale and the elimination of duplication.<\/p><p> I am happy to present the 2021 Estimates for the public expenditure and reform group, approval of which will allow the individual Votes to continue to meet their responsibilities and deliver essential services.  The Minister of State and I are both happy to answer any questions that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#A01100","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for coming before the committee and the officials who produced a very comprehensive document on this.  The first thing I wish to focus on is procurement.  There is a lot of concern out there regarding Government spending and buying from companies during this pandemic, particularly where the goods it has bought have then proven to be faulty or not up to scratch.  We saw that with the purchase of faulty ventilators from two separate companies.  One transaction with a company called Shenzhen Prunus, which cost the taxpayer almost &euro;5 million, involved buying 250 units.  After a number of those units failed tests, all 250 units were quarantined.  Can the Minister confirm whether they are still in quarantine or have been destroyed, and whether the taxpayer has received a refund regarding this?<\/p> <p>  In a second transaction, 300 ventilators were bought from Roqu Media International.  That company specialised in entertainment services, not the provision of medical equipment.  That contract cost &euro;14.1 million.  This company organised festivals in Saudi Arabia yet at the same time, it seemed okay to give it &euro;14.1 million to purchase ventilators.  To anyone who has seen the documentary, it is very clear that this is Ireland's answer to Fyre Festival.  This deal was supposed to cost &euro;35 million and we know Roqu Media International was not the actual manufacturer, which was Shenzhen Probe, but it acted as the intermediary.  In actuality, it was an intermediary of another intermediary called Shanghai Lingang Group, an arrangement that was not made clear to the HSE at the outset.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister confirm how many of these ventilators were faulty and were any of them used?  Let us put this into context.  We need to remember that at this time, there were communities in local areas trying to raise enough money to pay for PPE for their local nursing homes or whatever else they felt was necessary, yet at the same time, we see a festival organiser get &euro;14.1 million.  That is simply not good enough.  I would really like to hear the Minister's clarifications regarding that issue.<\/p> <p>  I have also seen an internal document that looks at the risks relating to Roqu Media.  We see that it was red flag after red flag yet the purchase went ahead.  This was done internally in the HSE.  It said that there was a risk that expenditure of this magnitude would be wasted, that the quality of the machines was not to the standard specified or expected by the HSE, that there were no CE marks on the machines and there were issues relating to the variation in standards involving multiple machines being supplied from multiple manufacturing sites.  This was red flag after red flag so I would like to hear the Minister's clarification on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I understand that this same company was also involved in other schemes where the plug had to be pulled.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's views on companies that have continuous issues regarding the quality or standard of what they provide and whether there is any concern regarding them being able to apply for and win more procurement contracts.  Is it the Minister's view that this highlights weaknesses in Ireland's procurement regime and, if so, what is he going to do to ensure that our light touch regulation, which is what it has been called, becomes a bit more hands on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#B00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the question.  The first thing to say is that the Office of Government Procurement is not a policing or regulatory body.  It is a policy body that provides advice on how State money should be spent along with guidelines and suggestions for suppliers that have been vetted to contracting authorities.  I understand that the body that purchased these ventilators is the HSE.  The HSE would have been the contracting authority.  The HSE is responsible for spending its own money.  It has its own Accounting Officer and is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and to being cross examined at the Oireachtas Committee on Health.  Primarily, that would be the method of oversight of the health budget or the HSE spend.<\/p> <p>  I cannot really comment on the particular circumstances of that supplier to that contracting authority because I am not aware of the details but we must acknowledge the extreme urgency of the situation in which we found ourselves last summer.  We were facing a situation where we had a new virus and did not know the extent to which the numbers could increase to a point where they would overload our hospital system.  We could see what was happening in Italy on television and there was a rush to acquire PPE, ventilators and other equipment to prevent a calamity.  In those situations, there is room within the procurement rules for emergency procurement of equipment and supplies so that we do not have to go out to a full tender.  If somebody's house is on fire and one needs a bucket of water, one is not necessarily going to have a tender to obtain buckets.  Of course, there are limits to how emergency procurement can proceed but, generally, it seems to have worked very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#B00300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Regarding the Minister of State's statement that if one's house is on fire, one needs a bucket of water, one actually needs to make sure there is water in that bucket rather than something flammable.  Yes, we were all extremely concerned, as we still are, hence the reason we need to ensure certain things.  As the Minister of State said, the Office of Government Procurement is a policy body.  We need to make sure we have the right policies in place so that when we do have something like this - when our house is on fire - we are not bringing a bucket full of flammables but are actually bringing a bucket full of water.<\/p><p>Let us consider the ventilators, for example.  What if people needed those ventilators?  We spent millions of euro and had ventilators that did not work.  This was in a global pandemic.  This is why we have policies and why we need to make sure that our policies work.  I acknowledge the issue of non-competitive procurement practices and I understand that they can be needed in times such as a pandemic but we need to look at this situation very clearly.  With regard to companies that fail so greatly and so gravely in times of absolute need, we must ensure that they are not going to be used again and again, and that these issues keep arising.  That is definitely something I would be concerned about.<\/p><p> I would also push back on the whole concept of the non-competitive procurement practices.  What kind of data collection is there for these non-competitive practices?  How frequently are they used?  Who are the most frequent users?  What is the value in a given year?  What reasons are cited for going outside a competitive process?  I am aware that the OGP has provided guidance to contracting authorities on purchasing during the pandemic without a competitive process via a so-called \"negotiated procedure\".  That is one of the ways of going about the competitive tendering process but are the Minister and the OGP aware of the total number and value of procurement contracts for Covid-19 related spending in 2020 and 2021 that took place via negotiated procedure and without prior publication?  Is the office aware of anyone who is collecting this data centrally?  This is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#B00400","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":589,"content":"<p>The total volume of goods or services that were obtained outside of a contract or normal procurement rules is known by each of the contracting authorities.  The OGP does not keep track of each individual procurement contract that is taken out.  Even in the case where an emergency procurement is done because the contracting authority is in an emergency situation, they are still required to audit all of those procurement activities.  The Accounting Officer is still required to account for all of them and the Comptroller and Auditor General can investigate all of them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right to be concerned about the probity of public expenditure to make sure that money is not misspent.  That certainly applies.  In an emergency situation, however, the normal checks and balances that take place initially can be delayed or circumvented to deal with a critical situation.  Overall, I believe that it worked remarkably well last summer.  Many organisations contacted the OGP and the State to offer to the HSE equipment and PPE at no cost or at a reduced cost.  The OGP worked to take all of those offers and to go through them all.  It was extremely helpful.  Overall, I feel that we had a successful emergency procurement.  There certainly will be instances where things went wrong, and these must be investigated.  We must find out what happened in those cases and they should be audited.  If there was any wrongdoing, of course that should be punished.  We need an emergency procurement system for emergency situations.

When one sees that this company then went for another tender, it is very concerning.<\/p> <p>  I have one final question on expenditure for the Minister because I know other members need to get in.  Previously the Government put &euro;4.7 billion into Bank of Ireland and, as a result, now has a 14% shareholding in that bank on behalf of the people.  We have seen the news, which I am sure we can all agree is very disturbing, that 103 branches will be closing, North and South.  This affects mainly isolated and rural areas.  The national recovery plan is based on balanced, regional development.  With these bank branches closing in the more isolated and rural areas such as Oughterard, County Galway, surely this is not good for balanced regional development.

I acknowledge the significant public concern as a result of the Bank of Ireland announcement.  None of us want to see bank branches closing because we realise just how important they are for the communities they serve, for personal customers and for business customers.  On the role of the Government, as the Deputy has pointed out, the Government is a minority shareholder in Bank of Ireland, with a 14% shareholding.  A relationship framework agreement is in place that governs that relationship.  As a result of that agreement, the Government does not interfere in the day-to-day commercial decisions made by the bank.  We want to ensure that financial services are provided in communities around the country.  In that regard, we welcome the new partnership agreement being entered into by Bank of Ireland and An Post.  Arising from the bad news on the closure of branches is an opportunity for the post office network, some of which is under strain as the Deputy and colleagues on the committee will be well aware.  I also believe there are opportunities in this regard for credit unions to continue to expand the range of services they offer.  The Government will do all it can to provide a supportive environment and a framework for the continued provision of services.  It would be wrong of me, on behalf of the Government to say that we can control the decisions made by the Bank of Ireland on individual branches because we simply cannot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#C00400","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I apologise that I was not available for the start of the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Apropos of the previous discussion on procurement, we must recognise that in an emergency we need to have an emergency procurement process.  Whether it has operated effectively or efficiently remains to be seen, but it needs to be in existence.  Inevitably, emergencies occur and in an emergency it is not possible to go through a two-month or three-month tendering process.  In fact, it could be found that the procurers were negligent if they put people's lives at risk and the public would not tolerate it.  I would, however, like to know a little bit more about the extent to which emergency procedures are available and what covers the procurers in the process in that event. <\/p> <p>  On the banking system, particular challenges arise now.  I am not certain that they will be resolved easily.  At a time one bank is withdrawing completely from the market, another bank is closing down more than 100 of its counter services.  This is a big challenge and a disadvantage to many people who are dependent on the banking system.  We need to make sure that we have something to offer.  I will come back to some comments I have made in the past at our meetings.  I am not so sure that we have any influence at all as a committee, and I believe that we should.  Our views should be taken into account but they are not.  They were not taken into account when it was decided to close one banking establishment altogether.  We were told after the event, the same as the employees.  I do not believe this is good practice, especially in the aftermath of the bailout of the banking system, some by this jurisdiction and some by other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>The fact remains that either the finance committee or an appropriate committee has a function and a valid commentary in these situations or it has not.  If we have not, that is fine.  We may have to deal with it in another way.  Likewise, with regard to the Bank of Ireland, the employees were not warned beforehand and the appropriate committee was not warned beforehand, as far as I am aware.  We did not know anything about this.  The decision is taken arbitrarily.  I believe we must examine the basis on which these arbitrary decisions are taken.<\/p><p> The banks will say it is on the basis of the need to look after the shareholders and so forth.  We have to raise a red flag and say that while we are not shareholders, we represent shareholders and constituents alike, and some constituents may be shareholders.

We have an interest, of course, in the services they provide and the impact of any changes in those services on the economy and the communities that are supported by those services.<\/p> <p>  The banks are operating in a very challenging environment at present, as the Deputy would acknowledge, given the interest rate environment and the lack of returns that are available at this point.  We need to ask ourselves why a bank such as Ulster Bank, which has been in this country for 160 years, or its parent company NatWest Group would make the decision to depart from the Irish market.  We must think very carefully about the issues which led to that decision, because it has been a difficult and bad week for the customers and staff of Irish banks, given the combination of the Ulster Bank announcement.  It was devastating that the third largest bank operating in the Irish market would signal its departure, albeit over a period of a number of years.  The Government will do all it can to manage the fallout from that.  We welcome the ongoing engagement with Permanent TSB and AIB regarding what role they may play.  Notwithstanding that, it is still a very serious and adverse development.<\/p> <p>  The closure of bank branches is a recognition of a number of factors which the bank outlined yesterday.  However, it means we must do all we can to support the post office network and the credit unions to ensure that where services being provided by one institution are lost to a community, those services are replaced by another institution.  That is the key issue.  There are many businesses in communities that require cash services.  They require the service of going to a bank branch and lodging cash.  They cannot afford to travel 15 or 20 miles or further to do that because of the cost involved, the time and the security issues that are raised as a result.  I welcome the announcement by An Post, and we need to see the full detail of that over time.  That will be important to reassure customers that those essential services can continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#D00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as teacht isteach chun an m&eacute;id at&aacute; laistigh den tuarasc&aacute;il sin a phl&eacute;.  The country finds itself in a new banking crisis at present.  My major frustration with this is the fact that Bank of Ireland and AIB can function in the manner in which they are functioning because they operate in an unbelievably uncompetitive banking market.  The major threat to customers, small businesses, farmers and regional and rural Ireland is the wholesale absence of competition in the Irish market.  That has happened largely because previous Governments and the former Minister, Michael Noonan, created a two-pillar banking system, in part to protect the value of those banks.  What that has done is create a duopoly.  As anybody who does leaving certificate economics can explain, that duopoly means there is enormous supplier power in the hands of those two banks.  As a result, they can control all aspects of engagement between themselves and the customers.  They can do what they like to the customers because the customers have absolutely nowhere else to go.  One must either do business with those two banks or start bartering.  That is the market that exists.<\/p> <p>  I listened to the Minister and Deputy Durkan with regard to not wanting to direct these banks to take particular actions.  If I was in government, I would not want to direct those banks in certain actions.  What I would do is create a competitive market, a market in which those banks lose their supplier power and there are competitor banks put into place, such as a stakeholder public banking system, and in which far more banking power is given to the post offices and the credit unions.  My worry with regard to credit unions is that I have listened to ten years of platitudes in Leinster House when it comes to credit unions, how wonderful they are and how they should be doing more, but very little extra support is being given to them to enable them to achieve more.  Indeed, I met the regulator of the credit unions a number of years ago, who basically communicated to me that the Government did not trust the credit unions to have the management infrastructure to be able to provide a proper banking alternative in this country.  The thing to do in that scenario is to buttress that management infrastructure so they can provide that system within the banking market.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is moving into an uncompetitive space for banks.  That is the reason Ulster Bank left.  It left on the basis of a financial decision.  It was as pure and simple as that.  The reason is that banks in Ireland have to hold two and a half times as much capital on mortgages as their European peers, and interest rates are not providing income streams to banks.  Does the Government have a significant plan to introduce competition in the banking sector to make it attractive for a stakeholder public banking system?  Does it have a plan for the post offices and the credit unions and to make them more attractive to European competitors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#D00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>It is important to acknowledge that there is competition in the Irish market.  We have the pillar banks, obviously, but Permanent TSB is playing an increasing role in the SME market.  It has significant ambition in that space.  On the personal banking side, we have a foreign-owned bank, KBC Bank, in the Irish market.  It has restated its commitment to remaining in this market, which is important.<\/p> <p>  When we emerged from the financial crisis, the Irish market lost many foreign-owned banks.  They departed because of the level of losses they incurred.  The Deputy made an important point.  Ulster Bank left the Irish market for financial reasons.  It is a bank that makes commercial decisions and if it does not see a pathway to a sustainable return on equity, it will not remain in the market.  Unfortunately, to our cost, that is the decision it made.  We have seen some entrants in the mortgage area.  We have Avantcard, for example.  Although it targets a particular part of the market, it is offering a rate as low as 1.95%.  I very much welcome seeing that level of competition in the market.  An increasing role is now being played in the provision of financial services by non-bank lenders across a range of platforms.  A number of fintech operators have entered the Irish market.  They are lean, have a very low cost base and operate within the regulatory environment.<\/p><p>As a former member of this committee, I spent a lot of time engaging with credit unions.  In the previous Oireachtas, this committee compiled a very good report on the key challenges that credit unions face.  The Government is determined to work with credit unions in developing a strategy that provides a sustainable basis for the expansion of their services in communities.  From my engagement with them, it is clear they are expanding their services and investing in technology.  While they have issues with certain aspects of regulation, regulation is carried out in an independent manner and must be done.<\/p><p> I touched on the issue of post offices.  I am liaising with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, on the future of the post office network and how we can support An Post.  However, we must also acknowledge hard realities.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n touched on the level of capital provision that is required under the risk-rated assets system for Irish banks.  That is determined by regulation and is not determined by the Government in any way.  The truth is that the system ascribes an additional premium to lending in Ireland because it is seen as more risky.  That reality is related to the requirement to hold additional capital.  Those are the issues we need to consider and work our way through to make sure we hold on to the competition we have and try to find new ways of bringing in additional competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#D00400","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I understand the two pillar banks account for roughly 80% of the Irish banking market but I am open to correction.

It is a protection for the pillar banks - the duopoly that is now in place.  If we are really serious about post offices, it would be quite easy to give them public service obligation payments, and I think they have suggested &euro;17 million in that regard.  It is also quite easy to involve the post offices and the credit unions relative to community banking and public banking, similar to the Sparkassen model.  I think the Minister was actually in that bank, as part of a committee, examining the possibilities of that bank coming to Ireland, or at least its model being supported here in Ireland.  I would like to hear more about that.<\/p> <p>  When we dealt with Ulster Bank, the concern for many members was, naturally, the staff, the customer base and the question of the ownership of the various buildings that housed the branches.  In Kilkenny, as well as in Carlow, similar to many other parts of the country, there are buildings that are central to the landscape of the city.  We have failed to get information on that.  Now, Bank of Ireland comes along and it does exactly the same thing, with 88 branches closing down.<\/p> <p>  The post offices are asking for support.  The credit unions, in my opinion, are over-regulated when they could be used positively in terms of the funds they have.  However, it requires a radical overhaul of Government policy in regard to banking.  I have not seen a document that outlines a vision for banking in Ireland, what we see as being the banking model and how it is going to operate at community level.  I would like to see that happening.  KBC is fine and Permanent TSB may be a player, but it is going to require further Government funding.  We have to start a conversation with the banks on the basis that they caused the problem too.  They were the ones that had the reckless lending.  They were the ones that pursued individuals and small businesses, and pushed them to the pin of their collar, with suicides relative to individuals and banks.  We cannot ignore that.  They are at fault.  I am not one bit surprised that Ulster Bank pulled out of the country because NatWest made it pull out of the country.  It is as simple as that.  They wanted to get their hands on the grubby money they had.  It is fair to hold the banks to account but it is also fair that the Government should have a published policy as to where it is going in regard to banking.  That is what I would like to see.  I would also like to see within, for example, AIB, where there is the EBS tied agents issue, that we get it to resolve that.  We own the bank.<\/p> <p>  I am going to keep coming back to these issues because I believe the banks, by and large, have blackguarded their customers and are taking advantage of Covid by closing down branches and making big decisions that affect our economic well-being.

While we are on the subject of the banks, I want to remind myself and everybody else that a major issue was tracker mortgages.  The banks held the view for a long time that they could not afford tracker mortgages because they were losing money on them, which, of course, was untrue.  They were not losing money but, potentially, they could have charged more if they did not have tracker mortgages, so they could make more profits.  Other European banks right across the European Union did not seem to have a problem and they were acceptable.  We need to find out more information in regard to why we are so different.  Is it because we are a small country or because we are not full members of the European Union, which, of course, we know is not true?  We should be entitled to the full entitlements that go with membership of the European Union.  If they have tracker mortgages throughout Europe, I do not see any reason we should not accept them here.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the question of reserves and risk, I acknowledge what the Minister says about that, but the risk was created, as the Chairman rightly said, by the banks themselves.  They encouraged people to borrow wildly and indiscriminately.  It was not necessarily the customer who looked for this.  The banks offered them facilities that were above and beyond their ability to discharge.<\/p> <p>  We are in a situation where, as we proceed into the future, we need to get clarity as to where we are going.  Incidentally, given the previous conversation on procurement and how some contracts are filled from inside the State and some from outside the State, I remember having the temerity to inquire into that some years ago and I was treated with absolute disdain.  I was asked how anybody could ask a question like that.  That is as it may be.  We have to do things in the future in a way that is not in accord with what happened in the past.  As the Chairman said, we have to account for our activities and what we are doing to protect our constituents throughout the length and breadth of the country.<\/p> <p>  I am not certain how good-hearted the banking system is going to be towards the credit unions or the post offices.  Previously, the post offices needed an extra revenue-generating avenue and, presumably, it will come in the course of the changes that are taking place.  I am not 100% certain but I would like to be certain.  Similarly, if a third banking force is required, how is it going to come about?<\/p><p>Do we wait for it to happen at the behest of the banks or do we suggest to the Minister and the banking system how they might construct a realistic competitive third banking force in the country upon which the Government and the public can rely?

The Chairman has always been consistent and forceful in raising these issues related to the banking sector.  He has also been very effective as Chairman of this committee for some time.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the staff of the banks was mentioned.  First and foremost, they are the people we think of at this time.  Different banks have made various announcements of redundancies, primarily voluntary in nature, over a period of time.  I hope they will all be voluntary but, nonetheless that will mean a major upheaval for many people.  Some people are late in their careers, others are not so far into their careers and, for many, it is a huge setback.  We need to acknowledge that and hope the banks fulfil the promises they made in finding alternative employment, redeploying people and ensuring that lay-offs are voluntary in nature.<\/p> <p>  It should be acknowledged that during the Covid crisis the Government made very significant interventions in the lending market through the SBCI.  We have the credit guarantee scheme whereby the State guarantees 80% of each individual loan.  The uptake on that has been limited, largely because the demand among businesses to take on additional debt at this time is muted for understandable reasons.  They are trying to survive.  The State has done the best it can in the form of the employment wage subsidy scheme and restart grants and we will continue to support businesses in that way.  We have also provided considerable support through Microfinance Ireland in the context of small and micro businesses getting support on attractive terms.  Those schemes have proven to be particularly popular and successful.  That should also be acknowledged.  My understanding is that the Minister for Finance will be before the D&aacute;il on banking issues this week.  I am sure he would welcome the opportunity to come before this committee also but, having said that, I am more than happy to answer any question put to me on the wider issues affecting the banking sector, the people working in it and the customers being served.  <\/p> <p>  The post office network and the credit unions have a major role to play.  There has been much talk for many years about setting up new banks in the form of new public banking.  The credit unions are a form of community banking.  With the right support and strategy, I believe that is a role they can very successfully fulfil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#G00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Does Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n want to come in again?

It feels like the Government is a spectator in a market at the moment.  The Government nearly has an ideological feeling that it does not have a right to engage and fix this particular issue, which is strange because at least one of the parties of Government sees itself as a party of the free market.  This is not a free market; this is a dysfunctional market.  The Minister mentioned the credit unions but it is long past the time we should have a concrete proposal from Government on how the credit unions will get into a position where they can be an additional force.  This is not about looking into or considering this issue.  This is the time for that plan to crystallise in terms of this discussion, rather than being in the future.  The Minister mentioned interventions in the banking market with extra funding but that extra funding has gone through the pillar banks in the main, other than Microfinance Ireland, which provided approximately 1,000 loans last year, and that is small fry compared to the needs of small businesses throughout the country.  This is having a significant effect on regional and rural Ireland.  If we do not fix the dysfunction in the banking market right now, this will lead to further problems down the road.  It will mean two pillar banks will harvest greater profits from their customers and provide fewer services to them for that profit.

That offers very significant potential for credit unions to gain a foothold in that market.  The Minister for Finance has a credit union advisory committee, which advises him on the strategic issues affecting the credit union sector.  There is ongoing engagement with the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Managers Association on all those issues.

As part of that, we follow the recommendations in the Ernst and Young report on the national children's hospital, which recommended there be some form of monitoring of capital spend outside of the contracting authority.

However, we can use the levers we have, including our role as a shareholder in An Post, our role as a supporter of the credit union movement and our role generally in banking policy to try to ensure that services are provided.  It is a very difficult time for any community relying on the services of branches that will close later this year or in the future in the case of Ulster Bank.

In terms of reform, are there plans to reform the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General to the extent that it might be amalgamated with the Local Government Audit Service, such that we would have one audit office for the country?  The spend on local government does not get the same scrutiny as Departments and agencies.  Given the amount of money that is now going through local government, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be improved to allow for that audit and also to allow for the possibility of auditing any body that would get a significant amount of funding from Government.  I am not suggesting that office would audit every body but that if the occasion arose, as it did in the past, there would not be any legal obstacle to the Comptroller and Auditor General following the money.<\/p> <p>  My second question is also on reform.  This morning, the ESRI was mentioned.  I refer now to the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  In organisations that have a bearing on Government policy there is little input from the private sector and so each one of those organisations is heavily weighted towards public sector involvement.  I believe they would benefit from an appropriate level of private sector involvement.  Similar to the gender quota, there should be a minimum of 30% representation on these agencies and boards by people from the private sector in order that we would have a dynamic working between public and private and, perhaps, an influence on policy that would be more positive and business driven than is the case now.  I believe there is a lack of diversity in this area.  I ask the Minister to comment on the fact that of all of the people recruited from the public sector to the higher level within the Civil Service, only 8% have been successful.  In other words, only 8% of those coming from the interview process are from the private sector.  The issue here is the level of pay.  A person from within the service receives a level of pay that is equal to his or her current standing within the organisation but a person coming in from the outside must start at the bottom level of the scale.  I think the Minister needs to look at that.<\/p> <p>  Staying with the issue of reform, we continually refer to the relationship framework with the banks.  I accept the following is probably a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, but I suggest to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, as I will also suggest to the Minister for Finance, that the relationship framework should be reviewed and a clause inserted therein that allows the Minister to intervene where it is in the interests of the community, society and the State so that we need not always put forward the excuse that it is not within the relationship framework to do this or that.  Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned the banking framework for the future.  We need to examine that closely.  We should stop the branch closures.  This committee should be saying to the Government that it too should be insisting that there be no branch closures by Bank of Ireland.  The public banking model report was produced and discussed at this committee and the Government at that time, which introduced vulture funds to the country, did not support the public banking model.  It was in the previous programme for Government and it is mentioned in the current programme for Government, as are so many other issues it is hard to believe anything has been left out.  I would like to see that coming forward.<\/p> <p>  There are two final issues I want to raise.  There are employees of a semi-State company based in Shannon waiting to be redeployed to various parts of the public service.  They have been waiting a considerable length of time but no move has been made in regard to the numbers.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this matter.  A number of the employees want to deploy to civil or public service jobs.  This process has been stalled for some time.  It now needs to be revisited in order that the employees' case is settled.<\/p> <p>  On the whistleblower legislation, I understand the Minister does not have authority in respect of each disclosure but that legislation needs to be reviewed.  The committee has decided to do its best in the context of the restrictions in place on committee work to take that into consideration.  Looking across the disclosures that have been made, is the Minister concerned by the actions of the State in terms of how disclosures have been handled?  One whistleblower was named at the Committee of Public Accounts and that is illegal.  The arm of the State with which whistleblowers are dealing is using a significant amount of taxpayers' money to beat them down.  In some cases, what the whistleblower or protected disclosure has disclosed has been a help to the State and it has been acknowledged that it is, rightfully, a protected disclosure yet, particularly in the education sector, there is a refusal to sort out the problem.  It is similar to the question on the procurement side raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth.<\/p><p>The legislation and policymaking are there but where a perceived wrongdoing to a person who has made a protected disclosure is identified, nobody will intervene.  The matter is left locked between the Department concerned and the law, with the weight being on the side of the Department because it has access freely to taxpayers' money to defend something that really cannot be defended.  Surely the Minister must be concerned that aspects of this law are not working, particularly the aspect that is costing the taxpayer so much money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#K00800","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":684,"content":"<p>The Chairman raised a lot of queries and I will do my best to respond to as many of them as I can.

I will shortly be setting out my proposals in that area and it is my view that we need to bring in more private sector expertise to the oversight and management of projects.  There are opportunities in the case of the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, for example, which is, in effect, made up of Secretaries General, one external person and the chairperson of the OPW.  We need people with a wider pool of skills serving on a board like that, given the really important role it plays in overseeing the implementation of the national planning framework and the NDP.

A review is needed and some changes are required.  An EU directive on whistleblowing was adopted in October 2019 and we have until December of this year to transpose it into our national laws.  A public consultation on the areas of the directive where Ireland has discretion took place last year, closing in July.  A total of 24 submissions were received as part of that process and they will inform the approach to be taken in the transposition of the directive.  My intention is to bring forward the legislation as early as I possibly can in order that we can engage in pre-legislative scrutiny.  There are important issues around protected disclosures that we need to look at afresh.  The legislation is seven years old and we must learn from our experience over that period of time to see how we can improve and strengthen it.

In many ways, this is an economic elephant in the room that we will be faced with when, God willing, the pandemic is subsiding.  Has the Government developed any plan to reduce the budget deficit and the timescales that might apply for that reduction?  Has the EU been in contact and have there been any discussions with it regarding the timescales to meet the fiscal rules?  Has there been any discussion with the ECB in this regard?  Can the Minister give us any information as to whether the reduction will be done through tax hikes, public spending cuts or economic growth?  My preference would be economic growth.  There is a massive train coming around the corner and I want to know the Minister's thinking on how we are going to avoid it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#L01200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  It is absolutely the case that the pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the public finances, first and foremost on the people we serve, including the 470,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, many of whom have remained out of work for almost a year since they lost their jobs in March 2020.  Our number one priority and challenge will be to rebuild the economy and bring about a recovery that is focused on helping people to get back to work.<\/p><p>There was a question on the deficit.  The preliminary estimate for last year, as committee members know, is of a deficit of &euro;19 billion and a forecast we made in the budget for 2021 is of a deficit of a similar order or slightly higher at over &euro;20 billion.  The truth is that we are in a period of such uncertainty that it is difficult to make predictions.<\/p><p> We need to consider in the coming weeks how we approach the stability programme update.  As committee members know, we must prepare and submit that statement to the European Commission by the end of April.  I imagine there will be engagement with the committee as part of that process.  We will have the summer economic statement in the summer as well.  We made provision in the budget for the contingency fund and for the recovery fund.  Those two are being used currently to sustain the supports currently in place in the form of the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme and so on.  Those funds will come under strain as we move through the coming months depending on the level of the public health restrictions.<\/p><p> In overall terms, last year we spent &euro;85 billion.  The forecast this year that we set out in the budget was for expenditure of approximately &euro;88 billion over the course of the year.  The commitment we have given is that we will maintain the supports as long as is necessary and there will not be a cliff edge.  We are not going to allow them to end abruptly.<\/p><p> Recently, I had a good meeting with the National Treasury Management Agency to get an overall handle on the work officials there are doing in managing the national debt.  I was convinced following the engagement that they are taking maximum advantage of the current borrowing conditions, which are extraordinary because of the support of the European Central Bank.  As committee members know, the ECB has committed to continuing with the exceptional bond buying programme up to March 2022.<\/p><p> At this point the focus of the Government is on supporting people and businesses and getting everyone through this in the best way possible.  Our assessment is that the bulk of the heavy lifting in respect of the deficit can be achieved through growth, trying to repair the economy and bringing about that recovery.  I am not going to suggest for one moment that it will be plain sailing right through the full term of Government.  It would be foolish to make such a commitment.  Anyway, our focus is on continuing with the supports and bringing about the recovery.  A reduction of the deficit will be done gradually.  It will be led by growth and by helping people to get back to work.<\/p><p> I believe the Irish economy has the capacity to rebound strongly when we consider the level of savings.  Over &euro;15 billion in extra savings has been amassed in our financial institutions in the past year.  I believe the economy will start to recover in the second half of this year.  All the forecasts from the main bodies internationally and domestically are for growth of between 4% and 5% next year.  Now, we cannot take anything for granted but I believe if we can help to ensure that businesses get through this period, then that money is well spent in general terms.  We will keep the supports under review.  We are doing a good deal and we will see what further work we can do or need to do.  When it comes to the reopening phase of the economy there will be a need to try to give extra help to businesses, some of which may have been unable to open their doors for the past 12 months or more by that time.  There will be damage and legacy issues will need careful consideration.  We will work with people on that basis, but the commitment I can give is that our focus will be on bringing about recovery.  That is the best way to address the deficit, which will need to be addressed over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#L01300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy McGrath, the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and all their officials for their attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#M00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1614643200,"counter":698,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#M00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":699,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has considered the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/blockquote> <p>Under Standing Order 100(2), the message is deemed to be the report of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021030200002#M00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1614643200,"counter":700,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 2.55 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement","time":1614643200,"counter":701},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 10:00<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 10:00<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Rose Conway-Walsh, Frances Black, P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn, Niall Blaney, Brendan Smith, Emer Currie, Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn.

Ar an drochuair, faoin am a th&aacute;inig an toghch&aacute;n Tion&oacute;il in 2016, bh&iacute; tr&iacute; iarracht caillte sa tr&eacute;imhse deich mbliana sin Acht Gaeilge a thabhairt isteach.

Le teacht Ean&aacute;ir 2020, baineadh amach coimitmint nua do reachta&iacute;ocht Gaeilge sa chomhaont&uacute; R&eacute; Nua, Cur Chuige Nua.

Ar an drochuair, is rud &eacute; sin n&aacute;r tharla.  Gealladh fosta go mbeadh an strait&eacute;is Ghaeilge a gealladh mar chuid de Chomhaont&uacute; Chill R&iacute;mhinn 2006 i bhfeidhm laistigh de s&eacute; mh&iacute;, rud eile n&aacute;r tharla.  Breis agus bliain ar aghaidh &oacute;n chomhaont&uacute; sin anuraidh, t&aacute; pobal na Gaeilge f&oacute;s ag fanacht ar chomhl&iacute;onadh coimitmint&iacute;.  Is iad Rialtas na h&Eacute;ireann agus Rialtas na Breataine comhscr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; agus comhsh&iacute;nitheoir&iacute; an chomhaontaithe seo, agus c&eacute; go dtiteann s&eacute; ar an Fheidhmeannas f&eacute;in &eacute; seo a chur i bhfeidhm, t&aacute; r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach ag an d&aacute; Rialtas i bhf&iacute;or&uacute; na f&iacute;se seo gan a thuilleadh moille.  Mura nd&eacute;antar beart de r&eacute;ir briathair go f&iacute;orluath, t&aacute; deis mh&oacute;r ann go gcaillfear amach ar a reachta&iacute;ocht teanga sa mhand&aacute;id reatha ina bhfuil muid.

Dh&eacute;anfadh sin dochar ollmh&oacute;r don Ghaeilge agus do phobal a labhartha.  Is mian linn &eacute; sin a sheachaint.

The legislation was promised within 100 days and the strategy was time-bound within six months.  Neither of those has been realised in terms their legislative passage through the Assembly or the Executive.  We are not naive, we are aware Covid has happened and that this global pandemic has impacted on some of the processes in Stormont.  That said, normal legislative procedures are up and running, Stormont is up and running, the Assembly and the Executive are up and running.  These were two cornerstone components of the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  They are very much the main issues of the 2017 to 2020 impasse and we believe there would be a huge crisis in confidence if this current mandate finished and those cornerstone issues were not implemented.  We were told 100 days and six months.  We are now well past both those deadlines and our frustration is growing.  There is no real reason that those could not be implemented almost instantaneously.<\/p> <p>  We are anxious that this not be allowed run into another election.  We are very anxious that the Irish language not be used or misused as an election issue.  We believe it would be to the benefit of all - everyone in this committee and everyone North and South - to adhere to the promises made in the Good Friday Agreement and as an extension of that the promises made in the New Decade, New Approach agreement, to get that legislation and the strategy over the line as soon as possible.  I remind the committee we had a successful High Court case in terms of the Irish language strategy in 2017.  The judge put a legal impetus on the Executive to get that strategy through as soon as possible.  Therefore, not only do we have the commitments from the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrew's Agreement and the New Decade, New Approach deal, we also have a legal direction on the Executive to get that through as soon as possible.  We do not see any reason for stalling any longer.  The only impasse would be a political one, at this stage.  The legislation is predetermined, it is pre-written.  As Dr. Comer said, it is not the best legislation by any means but we must get what was promised in the bank now, start rolling it out and see how it impacts communities on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Tiarnaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":722,"content":"<p>Deir t&uacute; go bhfuil an Bille ann ach nach bhfuil s&eacute; curtha faoi bhr&aacute;id na polaiteoir&iacute; sa Tuaisceart.

During the negotiations and the talks that led up to the 2020 New Decade, New Approach agreement, we were very clear that the legislation had to be predetermined because our faith and trust, after three public consultations and about 15 years of going round the houses to get legislation through was always going to be a struggle so we wanted the legislation pre-agreed, we wanted it published and that happened.  The legislation was published the same night as Mr. Julian Smith MP and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, stood outside Stormont and delivered the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  We are, therefore, very clear that the legislation that has been published must go through as soon as possible but there does seem to be that political barrier and where there is a political barrier there needs to be political pressure.  Thus the motion we are asking the committee to pass today is to apply pressure on the two joint authors of that agreement, namely, the Irish Government and the British Government and then also the Executive office which ultimately has to make the final call in triggering the legislation and getting it moving.  The three parties I listed all have a stake in getting this over the line and it must happen as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Tiarnaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Glaoim ar Theachta &oacute; Shinn F&eacute;in.

As the representatives from Conradh na Gaeilge have said, it is not radical legislation; it is a reflection of the arduous journey we have all been on to get to this point and we just need to get it over the line.

As we move forward, and this is a clear priority for the community, it is important that there is an opportunity for the committee to continue to engage with Conradh na Gaeilge and with other Irish language groups and organisations about their experiences and why this legislation is so important.  It allows us to deal with this issue outside the realm of the very welcome and very important Seachtain na Gaeilge events going forward.<\/p><p> In terms of the work suggested for us today by Conradh na Gaeilge, it is very important that we take that forward.

Twenty years ago, my son was one of the first of eight pupils who were put together to form a na&iacute;scoil.<\/p><p>Twenty years later, as he is getting ready to go to university, the school is oversubscribed.  It is another example, if one was needed, of how much the language is flourishing, not just in north Belfast and the rest of Belfast but across the Six Counties.  Such has been the growth in numbers that Col&aacute;iste Feirste will, I hope, get its second campus in north Belfast so that we can provide that platform for those who wish to carry on their secondary education in north Belfast through the medium of Irish.<\/p><p> This issue goes to the heart of faith and trust in previous agreements.  The St. Andrews Agreement was referenced as was New Decade, New Approach.  With respect, this is not just another issue whereby we have a group before us today that is lobbying.  This is something the committee needs to take very seriously.  In respect of the representatives of Conradh na Gaeilge, how important is this for those children with whom they and I marched in Belfast city centre?  What is their personal sense of how important the implementation of this agreement is for those children who continue to be taught through the medium of Irish, those parents who send their children to Irish medium schools and those who want the same rights as everybody else across these islands?  It is important that the committee gets that personal sense from those with whom Conradh na Gaeilge talk on a daily basis as to how important this remains as an issue and a litmus test as we go forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#D01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finucane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":742,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid ag fanacht ar freagra &oacute; Chonradh na Gaeilge ar cheist Mr. Finucane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#E00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":743,"content":"<p>S&iacute;lim go raibh Conch&uacute;r &Oacute; Muadaigh ag iarraidh an cheist sin ach n&iacute;l a fhuaim ag obair.  I think Mr. &Oacute; Muadaigh is looking to answer that question but I do not think his sound is coming through.  To pick up on what Mr. Finucane said, of course, the An Dream Dearg campaign and the campaign for an Irish language Act were among the real high points of social organising in the North since 2016.  When we look at the demographics of those campaigns, we can see that this really was a grassroots community-led revival that tried to drive its own issue to the heart of the political discourse.  It succeeded after being pushed to the margins for so long and having been disenfranchised by this roundabout, where we have an agreement followed by a lack of implementation and then another agreement followed by a lack of implementation, and by going round the houses and having public consultation after public consultation, draft Bill after draft Bill and proposals blocked and blocked again.  This really was a road to nowhere until the An Dream Dearg campaign took it by the scruff of the neck.  Everything seemed to change in 2017 when we succeeded in having a majority - a very historic majority - in the new assembly for the first time for Irish language rights.  Obviously, given the cross-community nature of the assembly, we were unable to get that through.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the impact of this legislation on communities and the strategy, this is about young people being afforded the same rights as their Celtic counterparts in Wales, Scotland or indeed in the South.  We are the only jurisdiction anywhere in these islands that does not afford legislative protection for our native language.  This is outrageous in 2021, 23 years after the Good Friday Agreement that was supposed to herald a new era of equality.  It is hugely disappointing and frustrating for the generations of schoolchildren who are coming through Irish medium schools, many of which are inadequate and in accommodation that is not good enough.  Much of the progress mentioned by Mr. Finucane happened in spite of the state and in spite of legislation.  Communities have had to do that themselves.  They have had to shake buckets, collect money and build schools.  This has not been done without a struggle and those communities need to be applauded and commended for the work they have done to keep the Irish language going in their own communities and schools.  This legislation is supposed to protect them first and foremost.  It is supposed to take their language, schools and community centres out of the hands of political attacks, insulate them legally and give them a framework through which we can avail of services from the state.  It is mediocre legislation.  It is a starting point.  We want to strengthen it.  We want to be in a place five or ten years down the line where the same rights are afforded to us as to Welsh-speaking children in Wales.  We are not there yet - we are not even close - but it is an historic moment.  The most pressing point is getting this over the line so we can let the language commissioner come in, get this moving and working, see how it works and point out how fragile it may be in certain places.<\/p> <p>  One of the main problems we foresee is that rather than removing the language from that sort of vexed confrontational party political environment in which the language sometimes get bogged down, it re-embeds it because it re-embeds the legislation into the office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister, which is essentially a political veto over some of the works of the language commissioner.  We are very keen to get this up and running.  We are very keen to let those children see the impact of the changes they fought to bring about.  Hopefully, that can happen as soon as possible because people are getting hugely frustrated.  As I said, we are going down the road of a complete crisis of confidence in agreements so this could just be another agreement that is never implemented and we will be back here in five years arguing about the same thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Tiarnaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":744,"content":"<p>Teasta&iacute;onn uaidh Dr. Niall Comer as Conradh na Gaeilge freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist sin.

In answer to Mr. Finucane, I support the answer given by Dr. &Oacute; Tiarnaigh.  Mr. Finucane mentioned that his eldest son is now 20 and is preparing to go to university.  He referred to the journey in north Belfast.  We can empathise with that.  In particular, I can empathise with that because I have a daughter of the same age.  In respect of when he started his journey with the Irish language and people's huge personal commitment to the language in the North, over decades, people have made very brave choices with very little support.  When I grew up in Newry, there was a small number of Irish language speakers who kept the language to the forefront but there was not even a question of there being any legislative support at the time and it was something we could only dream of.  It is only in recent years that there has been a sense within the Irish language speaking community that this is possible and is something we can achieve with the correct political pressure.<\/p> <p>  I must pay tribute to the support from the Department for Communities and others for different initiatives to promote the language.  We talk about language rights and the future protection and promotion of the language.  We must also look at the reasons why the language found itself in that situation as a minority language.  There are many reasons but one of the main reasons was the removal of the language from any political sphere or legislative area.  This can be traced back centuries but it can also be traced back decades.  I support the points made by Mr. Finucane about a journey.  Hearts and minds and enthusiasm for the language are great and people can champion that but it involves us reaching a stage where people can live their lives through the language they choose, which is like every other right.  People have the right to choose the language they speak, particularly an indigenous language that should have official recognition.  This is not a pastime or part-time pursuit.  It is vital that this is finally nailed and put to bed and as Dr. &Oacute; Tiarnaigh correctly pointed out, the legislation is there.  It is still not sufficient but it is a starting point and is something on which we can build.<\/p> <p>  I thank everyone for their contributions to this so far.

I would like him to take us through what real advantages we can hope for from this legislation.  Thinking about the constant delays and obstacles in getting progress from the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and New Decade, New Approach, is this political or about the reluctance of unionists?  We spoke at this committee last week about the fact that we are rather one-sided as a committee and do not have that buy-in to the work of this committee.  When I look at how inadequate, inconsistent and sometimes insincere the political and official commitment to the promotion and the defence of the rights of Irish language speakers here in the South is, I wonder if it is only about political reluctance rooted in the constitutional question.  I know that is a little open but I am interested in what people have to say on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#F00100","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":747,"content":"<p>Tabharfaidh m&eacute; roinnt freagra&iacute; don Seanad&oacute;ir Mullen agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh P&aacute;draig n&oacute; Niall ag iarraidh teacht isteach.

We have protections, services and means of using the language officially on the islands, apart from in the North of Ireland.  That is essentially what we want to do.  For young people learning or interested in the language, who may not have the hang-ups of the past, caithfear a chur in i&uacute;l d&oacute;ibh agus a chur trasna d&oacute;ibh go bhfuil st&aacute;das ann ag an teanga.  The first thing is status for the language so that it is official and they can officially use it.  The legislation will help with status and with service provision.<\/p> <p>  The second part of c&eacute;ard at&aacute; ag taiste&aacute;l uainn and what we are looking for is the strategy.  The strategy will be key in providing those services and promoting the language more in the future.  That needs to be taken on board as well.  It is not just a matter of legislation but strategy too.  We have strategies to promote Irish in the South as is done for Welsh in Wales.  Wales has a target to meet 1 million speakers at present.  One can see proactive and worthwhile things happening.  Young people are enthused about the language.  The authorities, young people and schools are all working together to promote the language and making sure that everybody who wants to use the language gets an opportunity to.  In the North at the moment, there is no official recognition with the legislation and there is no strategy, but both have been promised for over 15 years.  One can imagine why anybody in the community, at&aacute; ar scoil n&oacute; at&aacute; ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id, can become cynical about the operation of politics when that cannot be achieved after 15 years of promise.

We should also mention the point about, unfortunately, the politicisation of the language by opponents of the language.  That has to be mentioned, whether it is an elephant in the room or not.  Accusations of politicisation may well be true but it has been largely been done by those opponents to Irish language legislation who see this as submission or giving in to something.  We know that this is not the case.  Those who are supportive of Irish language legislation have presented, <i>ad nauseam,<\/i>the benefits of this and shown the benefits not only of Irish-medium legislation but also the benefits of bilingualism and the cognitive benefits of raising children in a bilingual society.  All of this is research-based.  I refer back to the idea of hearts and minds and part-time language.

I am not a native speaker of the Irish language and my knowledge is limited.  I had a go in my maiden speech in the House of Commons.  I used that primarily as a platform to stress the point that the Irish language is very much part of a shared heritage on the island of Ireland, cutting across a range of different traditions.  It is important that we constantly acknowledge and recognise that.  In doing so, it is important to pay tribute to people like Linda Ervine who are raising the profile of the language in non-traditional communities.  That is playing an important role in trying to break down barriers and overcoming some preconceptions about the language.<\/p> <p>  I want to comment on the politics of what happens with taking this forward and ask our guests to maybe respond to some of this.  I am conscious that we have the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  I may not have agreed with everything that Conradh na Gaeilge proposed about the content but it was a difficult negotiation over a two or three-year period.  Thankfully we reached a positive outcome.  As we meet today, in March 2021, it is over a year since New Decade, New Approach was agreed.<\/p><p>There is only about a year left in the current term of the Northern Ireland Assembly, after which there will be elections.  No legislation has gone to the Northern Ireland Executive at this stage, as far as I am aware.  In practice, therefore, there is less than a year in which to legislate to take this forward.  I appreciate that people are somewhat frustrated over some aspects of what was agreed or not agreed last year but it is important that we stay true to what was agreed and that all parties operate on the basis of faithfully translating New Decade, New Approach into legislation - nothing more and nothing less - given that it was very difficult to strike a balance.  I am very fearful, especially with an election coming up and with the very febrile nature of politics in Northern Ireland, that attempts will be made to unpick what was agreed.  The flip side of the coin, therefore, has to be that there will be no attempts to add anything to the legislation beyond what was agreed in New Decade, New Approach.  The best way to get it on the Statute Book is to play with a very straight bat, to use an English analogy.  In that way, anyone trying to unpick it can be called out.  From a practical point of view, I urge both caution and the approach I recommend.  That is the best way to take it forward.<\/p><p> I assure members that while my party might have taken a slightly different approach from others on certain aspects in the negotiations, it will faithfully honour and see through exactly what was agreed last January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Farry for that important contribution.

As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I believe it is essential and appropriate for us to fulfil the delegates' request to write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  He is a co-signatory.  The implementation of the Irish Language Act is not only a symbolic and historic step in promoting a progressive and inclusive Ireland but it will also implement outstanding mechanisms needed for true power-sharing in the North.

We are not going to be seeking to strengthen the legislation between now and getting it through.  We have seen the hard work that went into getting it to where it is at.  We are very aware that if there is an opportunity to strengthen the predefined legislation, there will also be an opportunity to weaken it.  The aim of the negotiations was to pre-agree and predefine legislation, get it into an agreement and get it on the Statute Book.  We are now in a phase in which we are seeking to get exactly what was agreed, for all its foreseeable worth and problems.  Submissions from the human rights commission and others would point out many of the problems with the legislation.  As we said, it is far from perfect but it is a foundation.  We are accepting it in the spirit that it is something we will very much seek to build on in the coming years and decades.  Let us get it into the Statute Book now, however.  Let us get it operating and moving.  What will happen in practice is that the big bad bogeyman that was promised will not appear and the sky will not fall in.  Everyone will not have to speak Irish overnight.  We are going to see very mediocre legislation making some quite necessary changes in normal people's lives.  For those who wish to use the Irish language, it will be meaningful and a step forward.  Members can have our word that we are very much on board to get what was promised onto the books.  That is very much our strategy as we sit here talking to members today.<\/p> <p>  I thank Senator Black, as always, for her support for our campaign.  Ar na ruda&iacute; a d&uacute;irt s&iacute;, our focus at the minute is very much on getting the language legislation and the strategy over the line.  As Mr. de Sp&aacute;inn rightly pointed out, while the legislation offers legal insulation, the strategy is almost every bit as important.  It may not carry the sound bite of the Irish language Act that made the radio headlines but, whereas the legislation gives the legal framework, the strategy provides for the civic and societal interventions allowing people, including families and young people, to use the Irish language in their lives when they choose to do so.<\/p> <p>  We are going to place great emphasis on devising a very strong, practical and useful Irish language strategy.  It is currently in a co-design process involving the Department for Communities.  We are on the expert panel in that regard but, unfortunately, we are very clearly bound to a timeframe of six months in dealing with the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  Potentially, that strategy might not be ready until Christmas.  If anyone at this meeting believes a strong Irish language strategy is going to have a chance of getting through an executive three or four months before an election, we are going to have problems.  Therefore, it is very much in our interest to start fast-tracking some of this work.  If it was possible last year to do this within 100 days in six months, it is possible now to do it within 100 days in six months.  I very much urge that the promises made be honoured in this spirit on the premises where they were made.  It is worth reminding every member of the committee that although we lobbied all parties very heavily and met all parties on this, New Decade, New Approach was signed up to by everyone in the Executive.  That Executive is sitting on the basis or foundation of that agreement.  While there may have been political opposition to this before, it is now time that all the parties who signed up to the agreement and agreed very clearly and specifically to the legislation took ownership of it.  The Irish language belongs to everyone who wishes to use it and to everyone who signed up to the agreement.  It is time for everyone to claim ownership of it and get it moving together.  If we are truly sincere about building a place that is shared and respectful and open to tolerance, diversity and reconciliation, the Irish language has to play part in that.  Twenty-three years after the Good Friday Agreement, we have to move into a space where agreements like the one under discussion can be moved forward without further delay.  I hope that answers some of the points of Dr. Farry and Senator Black.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Tiarnaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":755,"content":"<p>That is very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#G00500","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I thank everyone.

It is an important question because the demand and need for legislation has come from the Irish language community and the broader community.  I think it is important we assess the reaction of that community to legislation that has not been fully implemented or has not been, in some cases, implemented at all.  The first word is there is quite a lot of frustration among the Irish language community.  That frustration can be seen not just in the North.  We see aspects of Irish language legislation that should be implemented in the South that are not fully implemented.  There is a sense of frustration and of being promised certain things for want of votes during election campaigns etc.  There is still a level of cynicism within the community.<\/p> <p>  It makes us feel to a large extent like second-class citizens in our own country.  That is important.  No citizen of Ireland should feel that way because he or she speaks the national language of the country.  Bear in mind that the Irish language should have official recognition in the North under the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  That is unthinkable.  When this is explained to, for example, journalists from other countries, they are aghast and have a sense that it is ludicrous that this should be the case.  There is frustration and, in many cases, anger.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that neither the New Decade, New Approach deal nor the legislation promised previously are perfect but it is a start.  There is a feeling in the Irish language community that we have pushed the door open and are moving to a position to further this.  This is where support from the Irish Government is key.  The Good Friday Agreement was signed by both Governments and is an international agreement.  Therefore, it is incumbent on all signatories to play their part.  Instead of shying away from the provisions within the agreement, the Irish Government should be proactive in seeking this out.  We should not tiptoe around the issue.  While there is no question but that there will be political opposition, that should not stop the Government from pursuing this and from challenging the prejudices that exist against the language.  Many of these prejudices come from an absolute lack of education.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.  It is an important question but frustrachas and frustration is the main thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Comer"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Comer.

I am trying to deal with it quietly.  We have two members of the committee who are Members of the Oireachtas.  They cannot speak here because they are not in the Houses.  That is the problem I have.  It is a reference to the Constitution I have been given which states that if an Oireachtas Member is not in the precincts, he or she cannot contribute, even though those who are not Members of the Oireachtas are welcome and willing to contribute from their offices or outside the precincts.  It is a ruling I have in front of me and it is a difficulty because I would love to hear what they have to say, as I am sure everybody would.  Article 15 of the Constitutions says that we can \"sit in or near the City of Dublin or in such ... place as they may from time to time determine\".  The unambiguous meaning is that hearings must be conducted in a place chosen by both Houses and that Members of the Oireachtas are obliged to be present in the precincts to participate in the meeting.<\/p> <p>  It is high time that constitutional provision was changed because it makes an ass of our proceedings.

We all share that frustration.  The lobbying part of it and this meeting today are an important aspect of all of that.

Regarding the lobbying aspect, will there be a ramp-up?  I take it Covid is restricting what can be done but it is very important.  At the Westminster events Conradh na Gaeilge did in the past, it always got a good hearing and it has gained understanding from other parties across the water in Britain.  Is there a sense of what else Conradh na Gaeilge can be doing with regards to lobbying?  We know what we need to do as committees and governments need to know what they need to do.

I thank him for that question.  I suppose Mr. Maskey, MP, put his finger on it when he said we are a bit hamstrung with Covid.  We have to be aware that it would be irresponsible for us to take 10,000 people into the centre of Belfast for an Irish language march.  As much as I would like to do that and as much as we are raring to go, and we believe the community would support it, now is not the time for that sort of activism or for organising around that.  That does not mean we cannot be creative in what else we do.  We have sought meetings with the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, to advocate.  Through the Secretary of State, Mr. Brandon Lewis, MP, we will be meeting with the Minister of State, Mr. Walker, from the NIO in the coming weeks.  We will definitely be looking to move this campaign to Westminster as well.<\/p> <p>  One of the important things we have not mentioned here in terms of the legal framework behind this is that not only is there the Good Friday Agreement, St. Andrews Agreement and New Decade\/New Approach, but, in 2001, the British Government signed the European Charter for Regional Minority Languages for Irish in the North.  COMEX, which is the committee of experts from the Council of Europe that oversees the implementation of that charter, conducts monitoring rounds on how each member states is implementing its obligations.  Systematically, one can be sure it will be hugely critical of the British Government regarding the implementation of the Irish language part of its obligations in terms of the European charter.  Most recently, in January, COMEX released its fifth monitoring report which made strong recommendations to bring forward a strong Irish language policy, legislation and strategy.  When COMEX seeks a response from the British Government, usually what we get is a blank page on the Irish language.  Where the British Government's report for Welsh, for Gallic in Scotland and for Cornish, Manx and other regional minority languages could span to ten, 15, 20 or 25 pages, we do not even get as much as two paragraphs.<\/p> <p>  It would be remiss of us not to say there are extra duties and commitments that are outstanding that tie in to the Good Friday Agreement, and not only the European Charter but the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.  There is a host of legislation and commitments here that are outstanding.  To be honest, it is hugely frustrating because one constantly feels, from week to week, one is being shafted, one is being treated, as Dr. Comer said, as second-class citizens, and one is being treated with total disrespect in terms of how Welsh speakers and Scots speakers are treated.  We will be moving that campaign forward and bringing those issues to the various stakeholders, whether in Westminster or back to Irish Government.  We will continue our ongoing lobbying with the Executive office and with various Ministers within the Executive.  We have commitments regarding signage and we have an ask around Irish language signage that comes from the European Charter.  We will bring that to the infrastructure Minister.<\/p> <p>  Part of the New Decade\/New Approach was around the repeal of the final penal law in Ireland, the 1737 justice Act which bans Irish speakers from using Irish in the courts.  It is shocking to think that here we are in 2021 and there is a penal law banning me from using Irish in court.  We will have a justice Minister - I am sure Dr. Farry, MP, is listening - who we could lobby.  We would not have to wait on the New Decade\/New Approach legislation going through to repeal the 1737 justice Act.  There is plenty we can be getting on with but, definitely, the main part of our work is getting the legislation on the books and getting a strong strategy through.  We do not want a weak strategy that does not have any impact.  We need to get the best possible provisions through to help an aspiring community reach its full potential here in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Tiarnaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":764,"content":"<p>Teasta&iacute;onn cead cainte &oacute; &Oacute;rfhlaith Begley anois.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021030200002#J00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":765,"content":"<p>It is more to come in with a comment as opposed to a question and to place on record my sincere thanks to Conradh na Gaeilge for all the work it has done in recent years.  I suppose \"frustrating\" is probably the word of the day in terms of us being back here discussing an Irish language Act which should have been implemented.  Unfortunately, it has not been implemented to date.<\/p> <p>  It is important to recognise and to acknowledge that the Irish language belongs to everybody.  It does not belong to one community.  Everyone is free to speak the Irish language.  It is part of our heritage and our culture.<\/p> <p>  We are increasingly seeing a shift in terms of the next generation.  Perhaps that generation is not tied to the legacy of the past and just wants to speak the Irish language.  It is very much attracted to it.  We are seeing more and more people, even from the unionist community, wanting to speak and converse in the language today.<\/p> <p>  If I was to ask a question, it would be to find out what barriers are in place in terms of that engagement between Conradh na Gaeilge and the Irish and British Governments and the Executive and what we can do.  I note a suggestion was put forward today and I very much support and endorse it.  In terms of opening doors or getting that connection to ensure Conradh na Gaeilge has the ear of the Irish and British Governments and those Ministers within the Executive, what can we do as a committee to assist Conradh na Gaeilge?  I note Conradh na Gaeilge has put forward a proposal today.<\/p> <p>  To follow-on from that, it would be helpful if we had these engagements on a more regular basis, that is, that we catch up with Conradh na Gaeilge on a regular basis as opposed to leaving it months and still being in the same situation we were in months previously.  I put forward that proposal, namely, that there is more regular engagement between Conradh na Gaeilge and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  These commitments have been made, and I refer not only the New Decade\/New Approach but to commitments made as far back as the St. Andrews Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement.  It seems that in some instances we are seeing a bit of progress, but we are still in the same situation today where we do not have the implementation of that Act.  That is what we want to happen.  We want to see those commitments delivered on.  This committee has an obligation, as the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure we do all we can to hear from Conradh na Gaeilge, as a key part of the Good Friday Agreement in terms of seeing the implementation of the Irish language.  It is really about seeing what more we, as a committee, can do for Conradh na Gaeilge to support it in the time ahead.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the proposal put forward.  Hopefully, we can have more regular engagement with Conradh na Gaeilge.  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas le Conradh na Gaeilge for all the work it has done to date.

One thing I want to mention on that relates to what more we can do.  We are in regular contact with various Ministers in the Northern Executive, trying to make sure that all that needs to be done in the background is done so that they can go ahead and pass the legislation.  We believe we are at that point now.  Anything the committee can do to bring this forward with the Executive to make sure it is put through would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  The second thing I mention is that we will be meeting with the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Robin Walker, soon on this issue and we will be able to put that forward.

It needs to be tweaked and to be developed a bit because it was put together a few years ago.  That can be done in the process that has been set up.  There is no reason this should drag out.

The first wave of Covid-19 led to an unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity, both in community and acute settings.  While many vital services were maintained or restructured to respond more appropriately to Covid-19 related risks, other services were suspended or delivered on a reduced basis.  In the acute settings, many health services were suspended on the advice of NPHET.  The provision of other health services, particularly in community settings, was also affected.<\/p> <p>  Many steps have been taken within the HSE, over the past number of months, to restore services.  Over the summer of 2020, the HSE prioritised, among other things, communications to advise and encourage the public to seek necessary healthcare and to attend appointments.  Many critical services continued through all stages of the pandemic, including cancer services.  Urgent and time-sensitive treatments are being prioritised, based on clinical considerations.  Innovative use of technology also benefited outpatient appointments in 2020 and between March and December 2020, more than 557,000 patients attended a virtual outpatient appointment.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the significant resumption efforts, the overall effect of this was that less non-Covid healthcare was delivered last year than in previous years.  Waiting lists for care in the country have been too long for many years and this has been exacerbated by Covid.  Our waiting lists have increased over the past year.  There are more than 622,000 people waiting for an outpatient appointment.  There are 81,000 people waiting on our active inpatient or day-case lists - almost 22% more than this time last year.<\/p> <p>  To tackle these waiting lists we are providing an unprecedented level of investment.  The total budget for 2021 represents an increase of around 20% on the 2020 allocation.  While &euro;1.67 billion of this is for Covid-related care and supports, including our vaccination programme, there is significant additional funding for new measures.  This money will be used: to address the known capacity deficits by funding more beds and employing more staff; to replace, insofar as possible, the lost capacity and activity due to Covid-19 with the necessity to operate at reduced levels for clinical and public health reasons; to ensure people can stay at home for as long as possible and be treated as close to home as possible, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  For example, we are providing funding for several million additional hours of home support.  The money will also be used to help alleviate waiting lists with an ambitious access to care fund.<\/p> <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2021 sets out how the funding will be used.  There is an access to care fund, which, together with funding allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, comes to &euro;340 million.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned previously, some services have yet again been reduced or suspended out of necessity to assist in preventing the spread of the virus during the third surge.  Given this, it is the intention of the HSE to keep the planned levels of activity, performance and reform as set out in the national service plan under close review and the chair of the HSE board has committed to updating me formally in April 2021 in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I would like to conclude by acknowledging that we cannot predict with certainty the future trajectory of this disease.  We must continue to ensure that our response is agile and flexible.  Most importantly, we must ensure the public feel safe using our health and social care services, and that everything that can be done, is being done, to maximise the availability and quality of those services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#A00500","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":784,"content":"<p>I welcome the officials from the Department of Health, namely, Mr. Greg Dempsey, deputy secretary general, and Ms Margaret Campbell, principal officer.

Has an assessment been conducted of how to deal with this and give more support to staff?  On a number of previous occasions I raised the issue of planning for retirements so we would know at any time how many people are to retire over a 12 to 18 month time period so we can plan for recruitment.

On the first issue, I wholeheartedly agree.  Many of the HSE staff are exhausted.  Before Covid arrived, they were run off their feet and over the past year they have been asked to step up again and again.  They deserve huge credit for what they have done but we all agree simply thanking people for their work is not enough.  We have to look very seriously at how fatigued people are and whether they are close to burn out.  If what the Deputy is saying is true, and people have had such an experience at least in some parts of the system that they are thinking about retiring, changing career or moving to a health service in a different country, it is something we need to look at very seriously.<\/p> <p>  The good news is the pressure has eased.  Today the number of Covid cases in hospitals has reduced below 500, which is very welcome.  The figures the chief clinical officer has given are very encouraging with regard to the impact the vaccine is having.  It is not just the vaccine, as it reflects lower community transmission also, but, from memory, the chief clinical officer was citing figures that suggested an approximate 95% reduction in Covid infection rates for hospital staff, which is very encouraging.<\/p> <p>  There is no question but that we need to work closely with the HSE, management, the representative bodies and, most importantly, the staff themselves to make sure they have the supports in place that they need.  My view is we need to do something for them and I believe that in the fullness of time we will.  We need a Government decision on this and Government agreement on what it is.  Certainly the HSE, the Department and the Government are taking very seriously the issue the Deputy has raised, which is that staff are exhausted.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the topic we are discussing today, when we successfully manage the resumption of services we will look at ever greater waiting lists and greater pressure.  With respect to planning for retirement, I might ask for a note to be provided to the Deputy on this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the access to care fund, the plan is absolutely as he proposed.  It is for referral and treatment.  The plan is not that people get a referral and are then designated for treatment but the supports stop there; the plan is that people will see the clinician or clinicians they need to see and are treated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#B00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":788,"content":"<p>On the issue of the challenges that staff have faced over the past 12 months, is it proposed that a process will be put in place to assess how they can be assisted?

As members will be aware, I commissioned an independent review by Professor Tom Collins to look at the allowances payable to student nurses and midwives while on clinical placement in the context of Covid.  There are two different reviews.  One is the review by Professor Collins, which is specifically in the context of Covid, while we are starting a second one that I would like to see finished and implemented for the September academic year.  This second review looks more broadly and structurally at the clinical placements themselves.  What we agreed to was an independent review.  Professor Collins provided that.  He was under a lot of time pressure.  I was keen to see that any recommendations if they were to be accepted by all sides could be implemented from 1 January so in fairness to Professor Collins, he did huge work right through Christmas.  He came back with a series of recommendations, which will be available to the committee.  The report on that has been published.  I accepted all of the recommendations on that.<\/p> <p>  His specific recommendation on pay was that there would be a pandemic placement grant of &euro;100 per week supernumerary so it would be a non-taxable amount of &euro;100 per week.  This would be from January.  He also gave me the option to backdate that to the start of the academic year in September should I deem it appropriate.  I did that and I have accepted those recommendations.  I would very much like to be able to pay it but, obviously, we would be paying it as an agreed settlement.  The discussion is ongoing with the representative bodies to see whether or not they want to accept that.  It is fair to say that their reaction to it, which they stated publicly so I am not giving away any secrets here, was that they were disinclined initially to accept the proposal from Professor Collins.

What is important is that under the EU directive, that time cannot count towards their clinical placement and degree.  My understanding is that a lot of work was done to make up that time.  To some extent, what happened last March did happen so the HSE did request that the clinical placements for the first, second and third years be paused and I accepted that request.  They were paused for a short number of weeks.  We wanted to pause them for as short a period of time as possible.  It was at the time when the need for qualified nurses was at its greatest so they were redeployed accordingly.

Between us all, we could not overstate the challenge in terms of the waiting lists, the unmet care and the missed care.  The challenges we face are very significant.  We are responding in various ways but, obviously, within a very challenging Covid context.<\/p> <p>  The first place to look is the national service plan, which is now up online.  We have broken the additional funding into a few different areas.  On increasing capacity, for example, we are looking at an additional 1,146 inpatient beds, increasing the critical care beds - up to 321 is the plan for the end of the year - 135 sub-acute beds and 1,250 community beds, including 600 new rehabilitation beds, and the very significant staffing that has to go with all of that.  There are big capacity increases as well in community care, social care, mental health, disability, wellness, etc.  I am probably out of time but I am happy to send the committee a detailed note and engage further with the committee.<\/p> <p>  Could I end this response by asking something of the committee in return?  The scale of the challenge we face, in terms of the waiting lists we already had coupled with everything that has happened with Covid, is completely unprecedented and nobody has all the right answers.  I would very much value the committee's view.  I do not know if the committee will hold sessions or, indeed, has held sessions on this.

I want to acknowledge the courteous and mild-mannered way he has dealt with everything.  I also welcome the opportunity we get in the committee to tease things out in a little more detail with him, and not in the combative way that is so typical of the D&aacute;il Chamber, even in the Convention Centre.<\/p> <p>  I want to echo the comments made in regard to the student nurses.  I made those points in a parliamentary party meeting and the Minister is familiar with them.  I welcome the comments the Minister has made here so I do not need a response from him.  However, I ask him to always bear in mind that this cohort of student nurses, as I know he knows, never envisaged what they would be thrown into.  Without them, the health system, particularly in regard to Covid, while it would not have collapsed, would certainly have had its foundations seriously shaken.  I ask the Minister to take into account the uniqueness of the circumstances they have faced and how they have risen to the challenge.  The Minister does not need to come back on that.<\/p> <p>  I also thank the Minister's officials and the HSE.  These are unprecedented times and this is an invisible virus, although we often lose sight of that in the midst of our own anger, frustration, anxiety, despair and distress.  When we do not have an outlet at which to direct those feelings, obviously, they get directed at the person who politically carries the can, and that is just part of the job description, I guess.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, review.  A different cohort of people contact politicians every day and we are told, for example, that we dealt with the kidney transplant people and those on dialysis as a result of public representations, which was welcome.  However, each week is going to see new cohorts of people and these have started to come into our inboxes in the last few days, suggesting that different categories need to be prioritised.

We are learning new things all the time, new studies are being published and new decisions are being made.  For example, Professor Butler, who is the chair of NIAC, was referencing with me at a session recently a new study from NHS Scotland.  From memory, she said it showed the performance of AstraZeneca and the MRNA vaccines was quite similar, and more similar than in the clinical trials, so that is relevant.  The data coming out of Israel are highly relevant in terms of reductions in hospitalisations in different age groups, and various reports have been published out of the UK as well.  NIAC is constantly looking at that.  For example, it considers what age groups are appropriate for the AstraZeneca vaccine.  France made a decision either today or yesterday around increasing the age groups for AstraZeneca.  New evidence is being looked at in terms of the timing for Pfizer or the MRNA vaccines, for example.

It appears from the figures that I have been able to put together that there is a substantial gap between the number of vaccines delivered to Ireland, across the three vaccines, and the number actually administered.  This is how it appears to me.  I hope that it is not accurate but we simply do not know.

Like many of her colleagues, she feels she could spare some time for vaccination in addition to her existing work, which is incredible considering the pressure staff are under.<\/p> <p>  Despite being employed by the HSE, working on the front line and being registered with the appropriate medical body, she is being asked by the HSE to do the following: No. 1, supply proof of police clearance for any country resided in for more than a period of six months; No. 2, start a Garda vetting process; No. 3, provide name and contact details of three references; No. 4, provide a notarised copy of two forms of photographic proof of identification; No. 5, provide a notarised statutory declaration; No. 6, provide a verification of service by her current and previous employers; No. 7, fill out an employee set-up form, pension deduction form and section 51 form of the public services pension; No. 8, complete an occupational health assessment; No. 9, provide a copy of registration and qualifications; and No. 10, supply a work permit, if required.<\/p> <p>  I realise how important it is to get this right and ensure staff are appropriately qualified.  This seems unnecessarily bureaucratic, however.  Perhaps we are flush with qualified vaccination staff but my fear is that the vaccine roll-out may be slowed down by a lack of qualified staff.  Does the Minister believe those requirements are onerous and may act as a barrier to the recruitment of volunteer vaccination staff?  Does he feel that we can rationalise that process in any way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#G00600","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":854,"content":"<p>That does not sound right to me at all.

One of the questions I asked related to the use of GPs as the primary referral into the vaccination programme.  I highlighted the fact that many people in Ireland do not have a relationship with, or access to, a GP.  We all know we are relatively short on GPs in this country.  That is particularly relevant in communities where people are experiencing lower incomes.  Those who have chronic conditions, however, might have a closer relationship with a nurse practitioner in an outpatient clinic or with their own consultants.  I believe there was a discussion that, perhaps, the referral system would be broadened to include or allow for referrals from consultants or nurse practitioners in outpatient clinics.  Is there any update on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#G01000","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":858,"content":"<p>If anyone in any of the cohorts being done now or that will be done next, which are the high-risk, very high-risk and underlying condition categories, has any worry about not being contacted by a GP, they or a family member can make a telephone call to 185 024 1850.  As the Deputy quite rightly said, not everyone has a GP and not everyone is on a list.  I know in my constituency in Wicklow, for example, it was impossible for a long time to even get on a list for a GP, such was the shortage of supply.<\/p> <p>  I see no issue why consultants could not refer.  I know at the moment, based on NIAC's latest clinical advice on the very high-risk category, the HSE is working with the consultant body to identify its patients who would meet the various criteria and, therefore, it may well be that the consultants have a role to play with that cohort.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, when we move to bigger population levels, people will be able to essentially sign up online themselves through a portal.

We actually have quite a lot ourselves, however.  For example, the three of which we are all aware, because they are now actively being deployed, are Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.

This week, there is a crucial vote on the suspension of patents and intellectual property rights and if that happens it will give the less developed countries access to vaccines.  I hope that anybody on the health committee would agree with giving as many people as possible access to vaccines.  If the suspension happens then it could free up pharmaceutical companies, particularly in the European Union, to make these vaccines and make them available to as many people as possible.  That is important because the fewer people who are vaccinated then the more chance there is of variants and so forth.  I am talking about a hypothetical situation and I hope that Ireland votes in favour of the suspension.  If it happens would the Minister, as a member of Government, direct the pharmaceutical industry, which is quite wide in this country, to immediately ramp up production of a vaccine that is off patent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#H00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":863,"content":"<p>I would agree with the Deputy on the objective.  This has to be a global vaccination programme.  The reality right now is that the developed or richer world is buying up the global stock, and there is no question about that.  Even if some of the stock was available for some other parts of the world very serious supports will need to be put in place in terms of healthcare supports, logistics, supply chains and a lot of other things.  Yesterday, there was a meeting of EU health ministers.  On behalf of Ireland, one of the calls that I added to that was that Europe would be the leader in terms of global justice on vaccinations and that was for two reasons.  The first is ethical as I think we have a moral obligation to help and, second, is enlightened self-interest.  There is no point in us vaccinating ourselves or Europe or America vaccinating itself if large swathes of the world are unvaccinated.  That simply does not work as a strategy.  For those two reasons we probably share the same end goal.<\/p> <p>  In terms of whether suspending intellectual and patent rights is the right way to go, what would have to be borne in mind is what happens the next time.  Undoubtedly, there are enough vaccines out there right now that if IP was suspended across the world generic producers all over the world could produce a huge amount of vaccine very quickly.  That is my sense of what would happen but here is the other question that we would have to think through.  What happens when there is a mutation that requires very serious investment in an updated vaccine or vaccines, or if an entirely new disease hits us in one year's or three years' time?  We would have to be very clear that if we suspend it at this time, the very same companies that we have relied on to produce all of these vaccines would not just say the next time that they would not do because the previous time we suspended their IP.  That consideration would have to be given very serious thought.        <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#H00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I am sure that the Minister will agree that vast amounts of public money have gone into pharmaceutical companies and it took up to about $8 billion to create these vaccines.

As he will be well aware, there are two avenues to access these particular treatments.  One is the ministerial licence scheme, which been active to date.  Since 2016, when the scheme was brought in, 144 licences have been approved for 55 separate patients.<\/p> <p>  What the Deputy and I have focused on is the medicinal cannabis access programme, MCAP.  It was based on a 2017 Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, scientific review.  The programme was put in place but never funded so it could not be used and I am activating that this year.  My Department has estimated that several million euro will be required but we do not know the exact figure yet.  Covid has complicated things a bit because of exports from Holland.  What the HSE and the Department have done, for which they deserve great credit, is to have deliveries made direct to patients' homes.  What I think we both want to see is for MCAP to be put in place as quickly as possible, and it is funded for this year, so that deliveries are made to local pharmacies for the patients, which will be a gamechanger.  I have no doubt that I, the Deputy and others will debate some of the other products from the Netherlands that, to date, had not been considered for inclusion; Bedrocan is one that we will all be familiar with and I think we need to look at that.  What I am told is that the Dutch authorities do not permit their commercial export at this time but that is something we should continue to engage on.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#H00500","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Health, the Ministers of State and the officials.  In political life one is never thanked for what is done or is positive but one will always be blamed for mistakes or be questioned about them.<\/p> <p>  I have questions on the vaccine roll-out.  Every dose that is administered is a positive.  I know that there is a great vaccination plan that will be rolled out over the next number of weeks and months, including up to 1 million doses in April that will be administered.  People over 85 and, indeed, over 70 in hospitals who await vaccination - and I am sure there are cases all over the country but I hope that it is a small number - were told following inquiries to hospital management that they must wait, that supplies are not available and that vaccination has to be done in the community.  When will people over 85 and, indeed, over 70 in hospitals be vaccinated?<\/p> <p>  The community GP roll-out is going well but I understand that some GP practices have not yet received vaccine supplies.  That might be a small number but I do not know.  Certainly,  I have been made aware of cases.  As a result, their list of patients over 85 and over 70 are not getting calls but I know that neighbouring doctors are currently vaccinating patients in their 60s.<\/p> <p>  I know that at least two offshore islands - Inis Me&aacute;in of the Aran Islands and Inisbofin - have received no vaccines for people who over 75 or 85.  I have advocated that we vaccinate all of the cohorts on the islands because it would be easy to vaccinate these small populations quickly.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the nursing home and healthcare sector, I wish to inquire about healthcare assistant staff.  I know that the occupation list for employment is being reviewed at the moment by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Has the Minister and the Department liaised or engaged about this matter?  The role is notoriously difficult to fill and requires the right candidate with a suitable skill set and caring disposition.  As we know, such people might not always be available even though there is a high number of people on the live register at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I wish to refer to nurses who have left the profession for childcare purposes, etc. and have not returned to the workplace in the past five or ten years.  What engagement would the Minister or the Department advocate to get some of these nurses back into front-line services?  I know it is not always easy to do such work and these nurses as they get older may not be able to perform nursing duties.

The good news is the forecast that by the end of this week we will have administered more than 500,000 vaccine doses.  Great credit goes to our vaccination teams across the country, as well as to the GPs, the practice nurses, the Defence Forces and so on.  There have been so many people involved and it has been a huge effort.  Has it gone flawlessly?  No, of course not, neither here nor in any other country that I can see.  However, it has gone very well and I am told that, by the end of this week, the large majority of 85s and over will have received their first dose.  It is worth acknowledging the efforts across the country.  People are working seven days a week.<\/p> <p>  To the Senator's question on the islands, the Air Corps has been directly involved in delivering vaccines to several islands.  I will check in with the HSE on exactly what the plan is for the islands he referenced.  It is wonderful to see.  It has been a real all-Ireland approach.<\/p> <p>  With regard to GP practices, I am aware of the situation as well.  GPs have been in contact with many Deputies and Senators to say they have not got the vaccine yet.  The majority of the GP practices were scheduled for this week so most of that will be addressed this week.  I have no doubt, given the scale of the programme, there may still be a number who say they did not get it in certain locations.  The HSE is working hard to that end.  It holds regular WebEx sessions for the entire general practice community, with thousands of GPs getting involved.  Part of the frustration some of the GPs have had is, if we look at it another way, due to the fantastic demand.  One thing that has stood out for Ireland is the very high acceptance rate and demand for these vaccines, much higher than some other countries.  It is fantastic to see.<\/p> <p>  On the 85s and over in hospital, logistically I see no reason.  Perhaps there is a reason the HSE has identified.  I wonder if there are clinical reasons for them to say they prefer the patients to be discharged in the community.  I will check in with the HSE and revert to the Senator on that.<\/p> <p>  On nurses who have taken a leave of absence, a career break or who have simply left, it will be part of the considerations for this year because we have ambitious targets in terms of nursing and other clinical grades across the system.  One of my hopes is that, as we scale up and hit the safe staffing levels, some of the awful pressure nurses and midwives have been under will be relieved.  If the pilots are anything to go by in terms of safe staffing, they made a huge difference to the clinicians, nurses and midwives involved.  Absenteeism and sickness fell while job satisfaction went way up.  That might be one of the ways.  We need a public health system that people enjoy working in and that supports our staff.  I have spoken with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about healthcare assistants in nursing homes and she will revert to the Senator with a detailed written reply on that, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#J00100","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

In England, Scotland and Wales, I am told it is approximately 10,000 - it might be pounds - over three years.  The amount paid to the students over four years in Ireland is significantly in excess of the amount currently paid over three years in England, Scotland and Wales.  I do not know about the other jurisdictions but my understanding is that in Scotland that payment or some of it is means tested as well, so for some students it would be significantly less.  However, these are all fair questions and we have to make sure it is possible for people to complete their training.  We want them to have the best possible experience during their training and to be the best graduates they can be.  That creates something of a problem for us because they are highly valued around the world and other countries look to recruit them.

If it is the case that Ireland is paying as much or more than any other country, it does not stack up that the amount paid while doing a degree is the reason students would choose to work in other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#K00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":879,"content":"<p>They are choosing to work in other countries because they get paid better when they leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#K00500","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":880,"content":"<p>That is a separate issue.

It may differ for each vaccine and it may differ based on the intervals between vaccinations.  What I can say is that we have pre-ordered just under 18.5 million doses, as the Deputy mentioned.  If it is the case that boosters are required next winter or at the same time as the flu vaccination, or maybe this time next year, we would certainly have enough to provide them based on our current orders.  However, there is an additional complication, which is that the vaccines may need to be adjusted.  The flu vaccine we take every year is different each year.  It is based on different mutations of the flu coming across from Australia and that part of the world every year.

To an extent, Ireland and the rest of the world will have to wait and see.  The strategy right now is to put in place very robust controls around international travel.  Even before hotel quarantining is introduced, the measures we have in place will put us at the forefront of the EU.  When we introduce hotel quarantining, which will be here very soon as the legislation passed through the Seanad last night, we will have, by quite a stretch, the most robust quarantining and international travel measures anywhere in the EU, very much in line with the UK.  That is one part of the strategy.  At the same time, we need to continue aggressively suppressing the virus here.  Very good progress has been made, thanks to people sticking with level 5.  We got good, heartening evidence from the ESRI to the effect that while people have been finding it really tough, they have understood that we absolutely must keep going.<\/p> <p>  If the vaccines are delivered from April onwards, we will be able to administer in excess of 1 million doses per month.  If the supplies come in, it will have a big effect on case numbers in Ireland.  The chief clinical officer in the HSE gave figures some days ago indicating that the Covid infection rate among hospital staff had reduced by 95%, which must be partly due to the vaccines.

My question focuses on mental health in respect of the HSE national service plan, so it may be for the Minister for State, Deputy Butler.  It pertains to transparency and accountability.  I must say that I am very pleased to see the attention to detail and focus on the Sharing the Vision report.  The report is groundbreaking and the focus is on closing the gaps and filling the multiple cracks that mental health services currently have.  I am very pleased to see that it is the main point of reference for the 2021 national service plan, as well as for Connecting for Life, Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide.  It is most welcome.<\/p> <p>  One of the most fundamental parts of reforming the mental health services is taking on the critical task of driving transparency and accountability in the area of mental health investment and expenditure.  In particular, we must examine how and where the funding is allocated and what outcomes are achieved from this investment.  How should we do that going forward, as we implement these new commitments from the national service plan?  In other words, how do we ensure that these commitments are more than just promising words in a report?  Where will the extra &euro;20 million go in mental health supports?  How do we effectively show transparency when it comes to investment and expenditure going forward?  There is a whole clatter of questions there and I hope the Minister of State was able to catch them all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#L00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":893,"content":"<p>I want to thank the Senator for her interest in mental health.  She chairs the sub-committee on mental health and we have had several conversations in the Seanad and otherwise, and I want to thank her for her continued support.<\/p> <p>  She is quite right about Sharing the Vision, which is the new mental health policy for the next ten years.  It is a whole-of-government approach with strong service user and voluntary and community sector representation.  As the Senator knows, the national implementation monitoring committee was established in November 2020 and it has already at three times.  Various sub-committees will be set up in the next number of months to look specifically at issues in respect of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and minority groups.  For example, we are looking to set up a Travellers group.  We are also setting up another committee to look specifically at the challenges that women face in relation to their mental health.<\/p> <p>  However, the Senator is quite right that we need transparency and accountability.  The most important thing with a budget is ensuring that it is spent correctly.  I will provide some examples.  This week is national eating disorder awareness week.  Yesterday, I met with those involved in the national clinical programme, led by Dr. Michelle Clifford, to discuss eating disorders.  In the past three years, there was criticism that the budget was not spent sufficiently.  Some &euro;3.9 million will be spent this year on specialist eating disorder posts.  The three teams that are already in place, and which have not yet been fully populated, will be populated.  We are also seeking to set up a further two to three teams this year because currently, not all areas of the country are covered.  It is most important that we have that accountability.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;23 million that I secured in the budget with the support of the Minister means that 153 whole-time equivalent new staff will be put in place.  For example, 29 of them will be working with CAMHS to help support the waiting lists.  There are currently 2,500 children on the waiting lists.  Some 39 new posts will be put in place for adult crisis resolution services and there will be six new whole-time equivalent staff places for the clinical programmes for early intervention.  <\/p> <p>  As I said, I have already met representatives of the HSE on this issue, because the recruitment of stuff must happen in parallel with the Covid pandemic.  Last year, for example, many things fell away, because the situation was so new to us that we were learning.  As we know now that we have to live with Covid, the most important thing we can do is to ensure that the staff are recruited and that they are trained up quickly.  For example, the staff recruited to provide CAMHS supports may already be trained in providing adult mental health supports but they will have to be retrained to provide supports for children and adolescents.  It takes two to four months to recruit the staff.  Recruitment for the eating disorder teams and for CAMHS is already under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#L00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I want to ask one more question of the Minister, if there is time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#L00400","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":895,"content":"<p>The Senator has gone over the time allotted, but she may go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030200002#L00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I would appreciate it if I could get a written answer to the question.

For example, information emerged yesterday and today around initial looks at one of the variants that originated in South America in terms of effectiveness of vaccines, higher transmissibility and so forth.  All I can say is that if the vaccines arrive in Ireland to the agreed supplies and if the rest of the vaccines are authorised, by September the population would be largely vaccinated.

I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to speak on this as she has led what is a spectacular success in respect of assessment of need.  I would love her to update the committee on that.  Essentially, there are at least two strands, with one strand building the permanent capacity in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of community-based care and so forth, and that is what the national service plan and winter plan are all about.  The second concerns the access to care fund, which comprises targeted interventions.  Last year, we were able to allocate &euro;7.8 million and the Minister of State has used this to specifically address the very serious backlog for children with assessment of need.

Last September, under Sl&aacute;intecare, we managed to get &euro;7.8 million as a targeted fund to specifically address assessments of need.  A plan was put in place between the Department and the HSE through the nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, with each CHO director of services putting a plan in place for the 6,500 young people under 18 who needed an assessment of need.  From September to date, 50% of that has been achieved, with more than 3,400 young people having an assessment of need delivered.<\/p> <p>  This was down to the initiative between the Department and the HSE in trying to use private providers over time and bringing back some redeployed staff who had been on testing and tracing duties.  Even during the second wave of level 5 restrictions and again in the current wave, we are still managing to get assessments of need done.  It has worked through the use of assisting technologies, as mentioned by the Minister, and there has been combined working between the section 38 and section 39 organisations.  There has also been support from schools when they have been open.  This month has been a little more of a challenge as we need on-school oversight.  It is nevertheless going very well.<\/p> <p>  It is important to finish on this note.  All the assessments of need for CHO 1 have been completed and I hope that in March two more CHOs will achieve the same target.

I thank the committee for its invitation and look forward to assisting it in its pre-legislative scrutiny of the affordable housing Bill.<\/p> <p>  All local authorities, along with approved housing bodies, perform an extensive range of housing services, including a multibillion euro programme of new social housing construction across all parts of the country.  In the ten-year period up to 2008, local authorities delivered more than 26,000 affordable homes and they have extensive experience and knowledge of affordable housing as a result.<\/p> <p>  While the emphasis over the past number of years has been on social housing delivery, local authorities welcome the new affordable housing Bill.  Affordable housing delivers homes to middle-income earners facing housing affordability challenges.  When built along with social housing units, it enhances the sustainability of these communities.  The addition of cost-rental affordable housing to the delivery methods available to local authorities is also welcomed.<\/p> <p>  The majority of the Bill's provisions are amendments to Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  They relate to intended improvements in the areas of assessment of purchaser eligibility, scheme of priority, charging period and the role of the Land Development Agency.  Other key provisions cover cost-rental and the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  The CCMA is of the opinion that measures in the Bill, in particular heads 3 to 8, inclusive, will give greater clarity and certainty to both local authorities and prospective purchasers.<\/p> <p>  The primary delivery mechanism enabling local authorities to deliver affordable housing is the serviced site fund.  To date, funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 38 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 4,000 more affordable homes.  Of these 140 homes will be delivered this year, with an additional 700 in 2022 and a further 1,500 in 2023.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that the serviced site fund is provided to support the cost of infrastructure associated with the construction of new affordable purchase homes on local authority lands.  However, the financial ability of local authorities to deliver affordable housing at scale is dependent upon a simplified serviced site fund bridging the entire gap between the full cost of provision of housing by a local authority and the affordable selling price.  The CCMA and the housing delivery co-ordination office are in discussions with the Department in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The timeframe for the delivery of such projects must accommodate detailed design, the consultation process, planning, procurement and construction.  As with all large projects of this type, the nature and scale of the developments will generally evolve as plans are progressed by local authorities.  The provision of affordable housing by local authorities utilising funding via a simplified serviced site fund will allow local authorities progress development of larger mixed-tenure housing schemes delivering social, affordable purchase and affordable rental housing.<\/p> <p>  However, it should also be pointed out that local authorities are still dealing with the legacy of previous affordable housing programmes before 2011.  Currently local authorities have approximately 2,000 unsold affordable dwellings with associated unfunded costs of approximately &euro;350 million.  While all these dwellings are currently occupied as social housing units, these legacy issues require resolution.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities are currently assessing their remaining housing land banks and will be acquiring land over the next number of years upon which to further deliver social and affordable housing.  Consideration is required on how best to fund these land purchases in order not to disproportionately impact on other local authority general services.<\/p> <p>  The CCMA is of the opinion that local authorities are best placed to assess the level of demand for affordable housing in their functional areas.  It has been working with the Department on setting targets.<\/p> <p>  The CCMA welcomes the measures in the affordable housing Bill.  Coupled with the serviced site fund, it will allow local authorities deliver affordable housing in conjunction with the other suite of measures in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Curran"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":926,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Curran.

Cost-rental is the one that applies mostly for approved housing bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Alliance is a collaboration of six of Ireland&rsquo;s largest approved housing bodies, namely, Circle Voluntary Housing, Cl&uacute;id Housing, Co-operative Housing Ireland, Oaklee Housing, Respond and Tuath Housing.<\/p><p>The Housing Alliance was formed to promote the delivery of social and affordable housing, address barriers and challenges to delivery, and promote strong professional approaches to housing management.<\/p><p> We warmly welcome the cost rental scheme.  We await further clarity on receipt of full details of the conditions and will reflect on those details when received.  We have responded enthusiastically to the expression of interest for funding, which was oversubscribed, demonstrating the commitment of Housing Alliance members to contribute to the new initiative.  It is our contention that, in time, affordable cost rental will be seen as marking a significant and important development in housing policy.  It provides a long-term affordable housing solution for those households that choose to rent, with the advantages that this bestows on the wider economy.  The housing sector has lacked an affordable rental option for some time.  The provision of affordable cost rental homes is an important initiative for those households whose income falls between private and social rental.  It brings Ireland more in line with other European housing systems, which tend to have a cost rental element in their housing provision.<\/p><p> Many households become trapped in the private rented sector, unable to move to a more secure or affordable tenure, yet their incomes are above the threshold to qualify for social housing.  They are not earning sufficient income to purchase a home of their own.  The cost rental equity loan, CREL, represents a remedy at a critical juncture in housing policy.  While the initial 440 homes is a relatively small number, given the proportion of households in need of an affordable rental option, we believe that the success of this initial year will provide the evidence and demonstrate the value of significantly increasing recurring budgetary allocations to allow many more cost rental homes to be provided in future.<\/p><p> As is clear to everyone, housing affordability is an increasing challenge in the Irish context.  Without a secure place to call home, it can be challenging to engage in many aspects of life, including employment, education, training and recreation.  Never has the centrality of the home been more acute than during the Covid-19 crisis, with the call to action to stay home and stay safe.  For many households, having a secure home of their own is out of their reach and unaffordable.  For example, 16% of households spend more than 30% of their net income on housing, with this figure rising to 70% for the lowest quartile of the income distribution, according to ESRI research in 2018.  That study also found a variation in affordability in respect of age group, location and household formation.<\/p><p> In social and economic terms, lack of access to affordable housing impacts on family life, household job prospects, household finances, family formation as well as national competitiveness and growth.  Furthermore, according to most recent figures, the median gross income per household in Ireland was &euro;45,256 while nearly two thirds of Irish households had a gross income of less than &euro;60,000.  Despite marginal reductions in rents in recent months, market rents in Dublin city are still at almost &euro;2,000 per month, comprising more than 69% of the net income of a household on a gross income of &euro;45,000 and just over 56% of the net income of a household on a gross income of &euro;60,000.  Rents in other cities, including Cork and Galway, continue to rise at a rapid pace.<\/p><p> Cost rental housing in Ireland is providing discounted rental housing developed by approved housing bodies, AHBs, and local authorities; guaranteeing long-term security of tenure to tenants; charging rents of at least 25% below prevailing market rents, with affordability likely to increase over time; and assisting tenants with housing assistance payments, HAP, after six months should they temporarily lose employment.  As in other European countries, cost rental properties act to counter the boom and bust cycles that often plague the housing market.  For example, in Austria where two thirds of the population live in subsidised housing-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":929,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt, but we must keep opening statements to approximately five minutes each.

I thank Mr. Curran, Mr. Dunne and their teams for their presentations.  As somebody who has been a long-time advocate of local authority and approved housing body delivery of affordable rental and purchase accommodation, it is good that we are finally having these conversations.  I must say, however, that I do not believe any lack of ambition is on the part of the people who are in this meeting.  If central government does not provide significant funding from AHBs or councils to deliver affordable housing then we will not be able to deliver it.  It is important that committee members know there was no additional funding for the serviced sites fund in budget 2021 above pre-existing commitments.  Only &euro;35 million was allocated to the AHBs for cost rental whereas we need to be spending far greater sums of money over the next five years to meet the level of need that exists.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions, the first of which is for CCMA.  As we know, &euro;300 million was allocated for the serviced sites fund over three years to deliver more than 6,000 affordable homes by the end of 2021.  That obviously has not happened.  As was said, we will only get 140 this year, 700 next year and 1,500 the year after, and those are pre-Covid figures.  What needs to change to allow Mr. Curran to accelerate the drawdown and delivery of homes under that fund?  If the fund were to be increased, what is Mr. Curran's capacity to handle that?  We need thousands of these units every year, not hundreds.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Dunne and his colleagues on the success of the applications, the details of which I know we will get soon when they are announced, for the affordable cost rental scheme.  My concern here, however, is that it is a very small amount of money and a small number of units.  The real concern is the rent levels, however.  This is not a criticism of the Housing Alliance but a whole range of people will not be able to afford those rents, for example, single people or those on a modest dual income who are above the threshold for social housing.  What needs to happen in that scheme to drive the rents down below &euro;900, &euro;800 or &euro;700?  Are we going to see any units in the city centre given the price differential there?

We do not want anybody to spend more than 35% of his or her net income on rent because that just brings people into unaffordability and issues regarding rent arrears, debt and so on.

This affordable housing Bill will provide local authorities, the LDA, approved housing bodies and the private sector with a set of tools they have not had before to try to increase supply of units and bridge that affordability gap for many individuals and households in the State.  I know there has been much public commentary regarding one element of the Bill.  I am glad we are talking about the other two elements of the Bill this morning.  It is quite useful.<\/p> <p>  I will focus first on the cost rental scheme.  The way I see it, the approved housing bodies have been tasked, initially, with proving the concept of cost rental in the Irish context, and the 440 units have been mentioned.

In my opinion, there is no point in developing a scheme in which we will not be able to quickly drive the number of units that will be provided.  I am certain there are funds and organisations that will be willing to provide long-term leases.  The 40-year horizon has been mentioned.  There could be long-term lease arrangements agreed with organisations to provide units and at the end of the 40-year period they revert to the State for a nominal free.

I welcome seeing Mr. Taaffe in this forum.  The representatives of both the CCMA and the Housing Alliance spoke about the benefit of delivering cost rental en masse in the context of rent affordability and to stabilise the housing sector.  I agree with this and the AHBs play a pivotal role in helping to reshape our housing market into one that is affordable and inclusive of all income levels.  In a previous committee meeting on this Bill it was suggested by the Housing Agency and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, that we require at least 2,000 cost rental units per year to stabilise the market and eventually drive down prices.  NESC also cited multiples of that figure, up to 6,000 units per year, as what we really needed.  Have the witnesses engaged with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on multiannual funding and access to local authority land, given that AHBs will have to deliver cost rental units on such a scale?<\/p> <p>  Second, we often cite the success of the Vienna model, which has exemplified the housing model centred on affordability.  In a recent meeting with the Austrian Green Party, which forms part of the Austrian Government with the Social Democratic Party, its members noted that every fourth flat in Vienna is city owned, with up to two thirds of the population in affordable and high-quality public housing.  That includes high-income earners.  Only about 20% of people own their own homes in Vienna.  That is not because house prices are expensive, but because of the significant investment in delivery of public housing as well as the evident rental culture that exists there.  What is the witnesses' perspective on the lease terms and the provisions we need?  Would they support leases of indefinite duration, considering the State's current six-year lease terms?<\/p> <p>  Finally, in order to maintain cost rental as a non-profit driven model, do they agree that cost rental rents should be priced on the construction and maintenance and capped at a profit of 3%, akin to the Vienna model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#D01000","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":957,"content":"<p>The first question was on engagement with the Department to allow AHBs to provide at scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#D01100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":958,"content":"<p>Yes, at scale.

It is interesting to hear about the NESC report with regard to 2,000 per annum.  We also hear about the 440 in the CREL scheme.  Ms Keenan has outlined that the Shanganagh scheme will have 306.  We are quickly approaching at least 50% of that target, and that is encouraging.  However, this is very much the beginning, the initial phase where we all need to prove this model, be satisfied and improve it.  There are opportunities to improve it as we proceed.  Certainly, the Enniskerry Road project was the initial pathfinder project and we have learned from that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of engagement with the Department about the funding and scaling up the model, the Housing Alliance has raised this.  I represent the alliance on the delivery group that the Minister chairs and we have raised two matters.  One is the need for us to get on with this and prove its viability, and then to make the case to the Department for future budget allocations to scale it up.  We have also highlighted the importance of the request for expressions of interest to be made much earlier.  We had expressions of interest late in December and we are delivering most of this in this year, and that is quite a tight timeline.  We believe it is important that it might happen in August and September while there is the parallel process of the Department making its submissions to the Government about budgetary allocations.  There is no doubt that is important.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of classification, we are actively involved in making an effort to reverse classification.  We are optimistic about doing that.  We are having conversations with National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Government about it.  We believe it is entirely possible for us to address it.  The Senator's comments were well made and they must be addressed.  We are working hard to address them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the elements that go into the cost, we agree that the profit element of this must be reduced as much as possible.  The purpose of this is to keep the cost down.  I cannot see how involving private sector actors or investors is going to keep those costs down when they are required and entitled to a make a substantial return on investments in order to get the investments they need.<\/p><p>Between the local authorities, the AHBs and the LDA, we would be optimistic that the State could adequately do this, that we are adequately placed to do it and that we are focused on the lowest possible rents for tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":961,"content":"<p>What about indefinite tenures?

The wonderful thing about the model is that the houses are paid for once and that cost might be repaid over 25 years, and then those homes are available at no additional cost in the remaining 75 years, except for maintenance.

The Minister announced 390 new cost rental units and I see that members of the Housing Alliance, namely, Cl&uacute;id Housing, Respond and Tuath, have been involved in some of those endeavours.  Of those 390 cost rental units, will the witnesses confirm that 50 of those units are already accounted for as part of the Enniskerry Road project?  Mr. Curran mentioned the issue of acquisition.  I am taken aback by that.  We know a number of local authorities have a legacy regarding the land aggregation scheme.  Nothing has happened in that regard.  That legacy needs to be brought into play in respect of affordability.  I accept there is a need for mixed tenure.  I would like to hear what the CCMA is doing in that context because there has been no mention of it.<\/p> <p>  I was somewhat surprised by what I thought was a bland statement from the CCMA this morning.  I had expected it to have been a bit more ambitious.  I am not suggesting the association is not ambitious but I did not see ambition reflected in its statement.

I know for certain from talking to city and county councillors around the country that they have serious concerns about the proposed adjustments to the section 183 disposal system.

Is the CCMA considering that aspect?  Has the possibility of more universal internal design been considered to achieve economies of scale, for example, in procuring internal fittings?  I do not believe universal external design is desirable or a good idea.<\/p> <p>  Is the cost procurement process being examined to see what might be done to lower the costs of construction?  There have been issues with some larger developments, for example.  If they have not been broken up, only a couple of large developers bid in the tender process.  The resultant lack of competition has been driving up costs.  Has consideration been given to breaking up some of the bigger projects so that smaller bidders can make bids?  That would then bring costs down.  Does that form part of the work being done on the serviced sites fund?  That is one way of bridging the affordability gap.

I have a couple of questions for the witnesses from the CCMA.  Mr. Mark Bourke from Dublin City Council told us about the problems local authorities have in comparison with the private sector in delivering housing.  In some cases, the process they have to go through can see construction taking six years.  In the context of the affordable housing Bill, are the witnesses speaking to the Department about the steps and processes that take place between local authorities and the Department in regard to the provision of funding?  Where does the CCMA see the longer delays arising in local authority delivery of social housing?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Curran said that he is talking to the Department about additional funding under the serviced sites fund.  What type of infrastructure is he talking about in this regard?  Is he referring to enhanced infrastructure?  In the case of the Dublin local authorities, for example, when it comes to building anything like playgrounds, parks and other facilities that build communities beyond the bricks and mortar of housing, they often feel that they are forced to sell land in order to get the money to provide that enhanced infrastructure.  Is there any case being made to the Department for funding of enhanced infrastructure, which currently is not covered?<\/p> <p>  How does the CCMA see the issue of guaranteed affordability in regard to purchase prices?  In the case of O'Devaney Gardens, for instance, some of the affordable housing units cost more than &euro;400,000.  What steps can the Department or the CCMA take in terms of the procurement process to bring that price down?  Following on from what Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, where there are one or two builders on large sites, local authorities are often forced to take what those builders say is an affordable unit.  Are there any steps that can be incorporated into the affordable housing Bill to enable direct dealing with small builders in order to reduce the cost of the affordable purchase element of schemes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#F00700","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":977,"content":"<p>In regard to delays, we have had many discussions with the Department down through the years about the approval process.  The Department, like us and every other public body, is subject to the public spending code and the various governance arrangements that are in place.  We previously agreed to bring it down to a four-stage approval process that takes approximately 50 weeks.  In more recent years, we have been working on the design-build process, which has shortened that.  In Wicklow, we are delivering schools through design-build and the initial process is taking 43 to 45 weeks, which is a significant improvement.  The Department now has a single-stage approval process for schools for projects up to &euro;6 million, which speeds up the whole process.  It is very useful for local authorities and we will certainly be taking the Department up on it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the serviced sites fund, it currently deals with large-scale infrastructure projects, including roads, sewerage and so on, that are over and above the norm.  They are covered, which will allow the houses to be more affordable.  The Senator is talking about social infrastructure, such as playgrounds and parks, for which there are various sources of funding.  It would usually come through us, by way of our community development levies, and we provide parks, open spaces and playgrounds all the time.  There are also various grants available such as the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and the urban regeneration and development fund.  We draw on those sources of funding all the time to develop community infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  In terms of guaranteed affordability, as Mr. Taaffe pointed out, we are doing a lot in terms of our procurement process.  We are working with the OGP on design-build and having standard layouts etc. in order to reduce the costs as much as we can.  After that, the serviced sites fund would kick in to provide the subsidy and discount available to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Curran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":978,"content":"<p>On the delivery of associated community infrastructure for housing developments, in the case of a couple of instances, local authorities are making cases for funding for community infrastructure to be tied in with the funding for the housing schemes.

With the legacy issues, is a full write-down of loans required or what must be done to get rid of the burden on local authorities caused by these loans?  The opening statement indicated that in the ten-year period to 2008, local authorities delivered over 26,000 affordable homes but 2,000 of those were unsold.  What lessons can be learned from this?  Has there been an analysis of the 24,000 homes that were sold to see if the tenants felt they had a good or fair deal and what changes would be made if we were in a similar position now?  How would the CCMA envisage the process of determining the price of an affordable home under the proposed scheme?<\/p> <p>  The Housing Alliance statement referenced cost rental prices and the relation to market rates.  Would it consider market rates to determine cost rental rates as appropriate?  There are areas where current market rates are extremely or excessively high.  Should the cost rental affordability calculation be done on the median wage in those areas so as to make these properties affordable for people?  There was an announcement for a proposed cost rental scheme on the St. Kevin's site, with rates between &euro;900 and &euro;1,100, but for most people that is not affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#G01600","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":999,"content":"<p>We are looking at the legacy loans, as I mentioned earlier.  The first step is to look at all those land banks and see what can be developed for social and affordable housing.  That is the best way to deal with it.  At the end of that exercise, there may well be land that is unlikely to be developed for various reasons, and the type of discussion we are having with the Department and the Housing Finance Agency is on how to clear those loans.  There are a number of options.  There could be another scheme.  The loans could be cleared by the Department or paid over time.  There could be an arrangement between ourselves, the local authorities, the Department and the Housing Finance Agency.  That is all up for discussion and we are analysing all those land banks.<\/p> <p>  On the unsold affordable housing units, there were 29,000 units built and the vast majority of people are very happy with the deal they got.  We get that information anecdotally.  Despite the scale of the crash, which was unprecedented in Ireland, only 2,000 remained unsold.  Those that were unsold are now fully occupied by social housing tenants.  They were leased to approved housing bodies and occupied by social housing tenants.  The lease then paid the loan.  We are in a position now where we must look at what to do with those loans.  We are looking at whether we should continue and transfer them to the approved housing body or what is the best way to deal with that.

If there is an affordable housing scheme available, it will be advertised, people will apply, they will be assessed on their length of time living in the area, the suitability of the house and when they applied.  Rather than going into distance from home to work and home to school which is cumbersome and inconsistent around the country, it simplifies it.  The plan is to have 70% of units allocated on those priorities and then 20% through a local scheme which local councils will arrive at.  That is very welcome.  The clarification around the charging period is welcome.  We have been in discussion with the Department on the serviced site fund and expanding it, which would be very useful.  There is a question of what happens to unsold affordable units, whether they transfer to social housing, for instance, as is effectively the case now.  That is something we need to consider.  If there is a change of circumstances while we are building these units, there needs to be consideration of what happens if the houses are not sold.  Acquiring land is a big issue.  It is a big outlay for us.  Currently, we recoup those funds when we start building, which is effectively stage 4 of the four-stage approval process which I mentioned.

I do not think anyone is in doubt about that.<\/p> <p>  I posed a question at the beginning of the meeting.  Affordable rental and purchase must be based on income, not on location.

What is the focus of this entire thing?  It is about providing a housing solution that is affordable for people who find themselves in the situation where the price of private rental is far too high, they cannot afford to buy a house and their income is above the social housing level.  The test of the success of this will be whether or not it provides for those people.  That is our objective and what we are trying to achieve.  My opening statement referred to the challenges faced by a high percentage of people who are unable to rent or buy on average incomes, and who do not have access to social housing.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  Everything we do is done in partnership with local authorities.  Whether it is social or cost rental, our first point of call is the local authority.  We discuss the housing need and demand in the area and what the local authority wants us to do and where we can help.  We do not see ourselves as the primary mover in housing in Ireland.  Local authorities develop the development plan, it is the planning and housing authority in that county, and our role is to assist when invited and when it is helpful for them to have us there.<\/p> <p>  For the people who live in those counties, whose rent we are trying to address, we are trying to match two things, namely what they can afford to pay and how we can drive the cost down as far as we possibly can, through reducing our own costs around housing management, buying at the best price, buying at fixed prices and using modern construction methods.  AHBs have been involved in modular house building in 2D and 3D designs and we are trying to do this.  There is no doubt we can improve on it and that we want to improve on it but we do work with the private sector, and we drive as hard a bargain as we can.  My organisation has 1,366 homes in construction.  That means we have the skill set to be able to tell the private sector that we know what we are doing; we know the costs, we know what we pay and we will only pay the absolute minimum.<\/p><p>The Senator has raised the issue of the real challenge, which is the gap between the cost of housing and land in Ireland and what people can afford to pay.

Unless the Government invests more than &euro;50 million in the serviced sites fund and &euro;35 million in the CREL scheme, we will not see the local authorities or AHBs expand their ambition.

Otherwise, the stuff does not get built.<\/p> <p>  I support Deputy McAuliffe's call for mixed income AHB developments.  Of course, the easiest way to do this is to allow the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, to be used by AHBs for mixed social and affordable rental schemes.

If the Deputy has any influence with his party colleague and he wants to make sure this is delivered, he should use it.  Let us not have two separate funds.  Let us allow the AHBs to have one fund to deliver exactly the kinds of schemes Deputy McAuliffe is rightly calling for.<\/p> <p>  On the target setting, Mr. Curran is being very generous to the Department.  The methodology for the housing needs demand assessment has not actually been produced by the Department yet.  Local authorities are drawing up their development plans without this methodology.  I know from my own local authority, South Dublin, that the development plan will be finished before that methodology is complete and issued.  Again, if we want our local authorities to set targets, the Department should give them the methodology for these exercises before they complete their development plans.  If anybody has any influence on that, it would be very helpful.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to price because ultimately, all of this comes down to what price people are paying.  Let us take the example of a two-bedroom unit renting at &euro;1,200 and a family over the threshold for social housing in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area.  A family with a gross household income of &euro;38,000 or &euro;39,000 paying &euro;1,200 in rent will be left with a weekly income of &euro;490.  Trying to raise two children, for example, on a weekly income of &euro;490 is simply not acceptable so we have to find ways of bringing rents down for those people or raising the social housing threshold.  What can be done to bring rents down further?<\/p> <p>  In terms of house prices, the guide price we are hearing is about &euro;250,000 and that is before the shared equity element of the serviced sites fund is taken into account; it is after that discount.  The average Rebuilding Ireland home loan in Dublin is &euro;200,000, so again, what we can do to bring those costs down in order that the above-average income worker can get the finance to purchase a home, even with the serviced sites equity element built in, at a price that is affordable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#L00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>In terms of bringing the costs down to make units affordable, it goes back to what we said earlier in terms of value for money, using design and build, building units at scale, looking at the design in terms of standard layouts that will drive the costs down while still maintaining good architectural quality, and things like going through frameworks with the Office of Government Procurement.  All of that will help to drive costs down.  Obviously, expanding the serviced sites fund will also help.  There are a number of things that can be done.  The situation is similar with regard to cost rental because the level of rent depends on the cost of construction, operation and maintenance.  If we can lower those costs, we can lower the rent.  People can get a significant discount.  I know that in Dublin, in places like D&uacute;n Laoghaire, rents of &euro;1,700 per month are being paid and if they come down to between &euro;900 and &euro;1,200, that is a very significant reduction.

We are starting from a very low base.  Ideally, we are trying to achieve on the cost rental what housing associations have achieved on the social rental.  Organisations like the Iveagh Trust, for example, which began in the 1890s before the foundation of the State, have properties which were developed and which, if there is a vacancy, are still available to rent more than 100 years later.  We want to see that kind of model into the future, where we build up the stock of rental accommodation which will, over time, as a number of members have said, drive down the cost and bring that stability to the market so that we do not get these huge hikes and falls in rent but rather have much more stability and drive down the cost for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses.

These issues need to be raised at preliminary trial hearings.

Newer Members may not be aware this is happening in any event.  We need a different procedure whereby the legislation, once reviewed, would be somehow notified to the D&aacute;il or, more properly, one of the standing committees.  There might be a requirement to review the review, see how the legislation is being implemented and whether further amendment or tweaking of the legislation is required.  It is an important part of procedures that is probably not followed through with sufficient vigour.  It often transpires that legislation we enact does not do what we want it do or does something we do not expect it to do.  It is useful to have a review.

That will all be dealt with in the preliminary hearing.  The issues we focus on, and this has been raised today and in other forums, are issues relating to cases of rape or sexual abuse, in particular, where a person's character or a person's sexual history would come into it - the clothing a person was wearing on a night out was used in cases in the past - and how that can be dealt with in a preliminary hearing.  We would all suggest, hopefully, that it should not be something that would be taken into a trial.<\/p> <p>  However, I wonder about other aspects of it.  For example, we often see in trials where there is a great deal of evidence of what is called a person's good character, a character reference.  For many people it is a type of suggestion that the accused person in a particular case may be from a particular class rather than from another class, and that is often used in proceedings of that nature.  Most of us would suggest that this is not appropriate.  Is that something that can be dealt with in preliminary hearings to ensure it cannot be brought up in cases, particularly where there are very serious assaults?  The emphasis should be on the action that took place, how it happened, where it happened and whether the person is convicted of it, rather than whether the person was in good standing in the local GAA club or whatever.  That is not the issue.  The issue is the hurt or harm that was done to another individual or to society in general.  Does the Minister have a view on that?<\/p> <p>  In addition, we are going into a situation where the emphasis of the legislation is on speeding up the judicial system to make it more efficient and work better.  However, as I said earlier, the experience in the other jurisdiction north of the Border has been that it has not done that.  In fact, it has created a system almost of double trial and delayed justice, rather than speeded-up justice.  We need to be cognisant of that as we move forward with this and ensure we do not go down that path and that we learn from the lessons north of the Border.  It is a different judicial system.  That must be said.  There are serious differences, and quite major differences in some places, but I believe lessons need to be learned at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021030200002#D00900","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>To return briefly to section 7, I might reserve my position relating to that for Report Stage, if that is all right.

The Minister can set out under section 5(2) to section 5(4) the types of orders that can be set under this legislation that can be addressed in the preliminary trial hearing, the reasons for doing so, the nature of the offence concerned and the complexities that arise in particular offences.  The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act provide important protections to victims here, which is slightly different from the North.  We have seen examples of particular cases where items of clothing were held up and certain things were supposedly brandished in courtrooms.  There are protections here whereby that should not happen and is not allowed.  One cannot always prevent something happening in a courtroom which should not happen, but there are protections under current legislation to prevent something like that happening.  The fact that the Minister can specify orders that are relevant defence or that are indictable under this legislation allows some flexibility that is not specified in the legislation itself.<\/p> <p>  Overall, the implementation of the O'Malley report and the implementation plan supporting a victim's journey are important in that process as well.

It is important that all of these recommendations are implemented as a package.  It is not just this legislation that will support victims who are going through very difficult scenarios and where difficult questions are being asked.  There will sometimes be scenarios where difficult questions are asked and we cannot always prevent that from happening, but we can do everything we can to ensure the support is available and that victims have that support throughout, not just in the court but beyond that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021030200002#D01500","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>As she is responding to comments made on the amendment, is there anything particular the Minister would like to say?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021030200002#E00100","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>I would just like to thank colleagues for the speedy passage of this Stage of the Bill and their support.

I thank committee members most sincerely for the opportunity to speak to them this morning and to discuss the pre-legislative scrutiny of the road traffic Bill and delays in driver licence renewals and driver tests caused by the current Covid-19 pandemic.  I am joined virtually by some of my senior leadership team, which was noted by the Chair, and together we will endeavour to answer committee members' questions.  We have submitted a full briefing note on the issues under discussion.  I do not propose to read it in full but I would like to highlight the main points in the interest of addressing key concerns which committee members may have.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the road traffic Bill, as members know, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced on 1 February the Government's approval to draft legislation which addresses several road traffic and road safety related issues.  The main provisions of the Bill include legislation around the use of e-scooters and e-bikes.  In addition to the legislation relating to e-scooters and e-bikes, the Bill will also include revision of legislation regarding the giving of driver instruction for reward, the introduction of a new power of the Road Safety Authority to revoke a driver licence and legislation for autonomous vehicles on Irish roads.  <\/p> <p>  The RSA welcomes the Bill and its provisions and looks forward to more details being published.  It also goes without saying that we are available to participate in future detailed pre-legislative scrutiny at a time decided by the committee.<\/p> <p>  The following summarises the situation regarding RSA services and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on them.  I will begin with the driver theory test.<\/p><p>The extension of Covid-19 level 5 restrictions by Government, until at least 5 April, means that the driver theory test continues to be suspended.  More than 80,000 driver theory test appointments in place over the coming months are now being rescheduled because the suspension of the service is being extended.  We are very much focused, in line with Government advice, on meeting the demand to restore pre-Covid waiting times when the service reopens.<br\/><br\/>We have plans to significantly increase capacity within the service when it can reopen.  This includes increasing capacity from an average of 15,000 tests per calendar month to 50,000 tests per calendar month when the service resumes.  This increased capacity will be available from mid-April 2021.  In addition to this, we are working on rolling out an online driver theory test service called ProProctor.  This was trialled in December and January for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses.  The pilot is now being evaluated and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is committed to extending the service for all theory test types during 2021. <br\/><br\/>Regarding driver licences and the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, announced details of a further extension to the expiry dates of driver licences on 24 February, as have other EU member states.  The extension will apply to different groups of licence holders, including those who benefited from previous extensions in 2020.  Drivers can see if they qualify for the extension by using the expiry date calculator onthe website <i>ndls.ie<\/i>.  Entering the expiry date printed on a driver licence into the calculator will tell a driver the new expiry date.  The RSA has told Insurance Ireland and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the extension to the driver licences.<br\/><br\/>Processing times for driver licences are taking longer than usual at the moment with standard applications processed within a 12 to 15 day average as opposed to the normal three to five day average.  This is due to higher volumes of applications, inclusion of a postal option for those aged over 70 and more complex Brexit-related cases.  The introduction of the extension to expiry dates of licences will result in reduced applications.  We are undertaking a number of measures with the service provider which will improve the rate of processing and we anticipate that turnaround times will return to normal levels shortly.<br\/><br\/>For those who need to apply for a licence or a learner permit, the NDLS centres remain open for essential workers.  In addition, our online application service <i>ndls.ie<\/i>has been successfully rolled out and those with a public service card and a verified MyGovID account can apply for their licence or permit online.  To date, in 2020, more than 40% of customers have applied online.<br\/><br\/>I know members are anxious about the backlog that is building up in the driver testing service so I will provide an update on this.  From the outset, we should not underestimate the impact Covid-19 has had on the driver test and the challenges faced by RSA driver testers to deliver the driver test safely during this global pandemic.  The RSA's priority is the safety of its staff, test environment and customers.  We have strict public health protocols in place to achieve this and, to date, since reopening in July 2020, we have conducted almost 90,000 driver tests.  The service is being delivered safely and in line with public health advice.  Our driver testers are working to test people in cars, trucks and buses so that supply chains can remain open and those deemed as essential under regulations can continue to provide their essential work.  I must commend our testers on their commitment to road safety and to delivering a vital public service at this time.<br\/><br\/>The waiting time for a driver test, pre-pandemic, was six weeks.  As a result of Covid-19, the suspension of services for more than four months and ongoing restrictions have all generated significant backlogs.  The extension of Covid-19 level 5 restrictions by Government until at least 5 April means that the driver test service can only deliver driver tests to essential workers.  Since we can only test essential workers, we are not able to fill all our available capacity so most recently circa 25% of driver test slots are going unused.  We expect this to persist during level 5 restrictions.<br\/><br\/>It is not possible to provide waiting times for the driver test because the service is not operating as normal.  As tests are only available to essential workers and we have surplus capacity we can offer test slots to essential workers almost on demand.  What we can say is that we have 98,414 applications on hand and of these 5,670 hold a test appointment in the coming weeks while 62,024 are waiting for a test.  The remaining 30,720 are ineligible for a test.  Those who are ineligible are generally customers who have not completed mandatory lessons.<br\/><br\/>If all customers who are eligible to be tested at present, that is, if there were no restrictions, were offered a test appointment in chronological order, we estimate that the average waiting time would be more than 20 weeks.  The RSA is making good progress in recruiting an additional 40 driver testers sanctioned by the Minister of State and our expectation is they will be available to conduct tests by the end of June 2021.  In addition to the existing complement of 138 driver testers, this will add much-needed capacity to the service.<br\/><br\/>However, this will not be enough to get waiting times down to the service level commitment of an average of ten weeks. The RSA is submitting further proposals to the Department of Transport seeking approval for an additional number of driver testers, on a temporary basis, to tackle the backlog.  <br\/><br\/>The RSA launched a new customer portal, <i>MyRoadSafety.ie,<\/i>on 30 November 2020.  It is a one-stop shop for all RSA services.  Initial teething problems with the new system led to issues for our driver test customers, in particular long call waiting times to access our customer care centre, CCC.  This was compounded by the large number of customers contacting us looking for a driver test date.  We have assigned additional resources to our customer call centre and reduced the call waiting times by more than 50%.  However, volumes are continuing at high levels with driver testing wait times being the main query.  We continue to improve this service.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to take questions from the Chair and committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sam Waide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":1295,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Waide.

There are 138 driver testers in place at the moment and there will be another 40 by the end of June to meet the commitment of an average waiting list time of ten weeks.  According to my analysis of the figures, there are roughly 68,000 people awaiting tests, 5,670 of whom have appointments as essential workers.  There are a further 30,720 who are awaiting the approved driver test hours from instructors.  There are just short of 100,000 people in the mix awaiting driver tests.

Clearly, with further level 5 restrictions during October to November, and also from late December to now going on to April, much more fundamental measures are needed.  Over the last month or six weeks, we have engaged with the service provider, Prometric, to see how to bring back the waiting times and meet the demand that is there.  The puzzle that is now signed off on is that the capacity will be doubled over those coming months.  The plan initially had been that if we were back up and running on 5 March, that for the months of April, May and June, potentially, 50,000 tests could be delivered in each of those months.  That is pushed out now obviously because we will not be back up and running until April.  If we look at the number of people who have test appointments at the moment, the number is a little over 82,000.  What that extra capacity will do is generate slots into the system that either new people can apply for or in the case of existing people who have slots up to October and November of this year, they can pull back and apply for another earlier slot during the year.  They are both options that are available to either existing candidates or new people wishing for an appointment.

Many people in rural Ireland, for example, farmers towing cow or horseboxes, use and require such licences.  A farmer from County Clare recently told me that when his licence came up for renewal, he submitted all the paperwork.  Lo and behold, when he got back his licence, the capacity to tow a trailer had been removed from it.  He went to the ends of the earth in trying to get an answer, and was told that there is a minuscule box on the form asking the licence holder if he or she wishes to keep their trailer licence on renewal of the driving licence.  That goes against the whole spirit of licence renewal.  The whole idea of renewing a licence is that the holder of a licence running close to its expiry date applies for it to be renewed and extended.  There are a number of cases, but not many, such as that to which I referred.  Those who have lost their BE licences in such circumstances, should have them reinstated immediately.  It is most unfair on farmers, and those in rural Ireland, in particular.  I ask Mr. Naughton to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#G00900","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":1385,"content":"<p>I am somewhat surprised because when one has a category listed on one's licence and one renews it but fails to renew one particular category, one does not lose it.

Perhaps they did not tick the box when completing the form.  However, that would not prevent them from going back and reinstating it on their licence.  Certainly, in the NDLS, when a person attends the office, the agent behind the counter will tell actually that person that he or she has other categories on the licence and will ask him or her if he or she wishes to renew them as well.

There are currently huge delays in the granting of these licences.  The SPSV licence is a requirement for those who want to gain employment in that sector.  In recent months, we have seen how schools, particularly in rural areas, have been pressurised because of the Covid restrictions in respect of seating limits on buses.  It requires increasing numbers of drivers being able to take on contracts in rural areas.  If the drivers cannot take the test, they cannot drive the buses and play their role in that system.  Can Mr. Naughton tell members anything about how the process can be sped up?  The delays are denying people the opportunity to take up employment and keeping some of them on the live register unnecessarily. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#G01300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":1389,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy talking specifically about the SPSV element of the licence itself, or just the driving test?

This is a huge issue throughout Ireland, and in particular in rural Ireland and my constituency of Tipperary.  Many of the general questions I had wished to ask have been asked and I will not repeat them.  The delays are causing significant problems for young people especially and have implications for jobs, the economy and insurance premiums being levied on young people while they await a test.  As I understand it from the figures, 68,000 people are awaiting a test, 30,000 are in the process of taking lessons, and 80,000 are awaiting the theory test.  It might be too much to ask but do our guests have the figures to hand for the waiting lists in Tipperary?  If not, I would appreciate it if they forwarded them to me.<\/p> <p>  I have a slight concern about the issue of testers.  Additional testers are needed, but given that many of them will work part time, I worry about their commitment to the job.  I am looking at this in the context of standardisation across the system.  It is not unusual for me to be told by a person who has taken a test that he or she had a stickler of a tester.  There seems to be a variation in the reactions of people who have taken a test.  Some of them find the test person to have been very nice and approachable and tell me he or she understood that they were nervous, treated them with care and gave them the kind of attention they deserve, whereas in other cases, people have told me that the tester was not nice to them.  For instance, I know of one tester who failed five people in one week, each of whom had been through lessons and had done the necessary preparation.  How are tests benchmarked within the RSA system?  How does the RSA ensure an equal standard across the system?  I am concerned about that number of people being brought in on a temporary, 18-month contract.  How can it be guaranteed that a temporary tester will be as good or as qualified as someone who is permanent and has been working within the system for years?<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome the submission that Mr. Rowland made in respect of e-scooters.  I am in favour of e-scooters but they must be strictly regulated.  We have all been to countries where e-scooters are licensed.

I support many of the items within the submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#H00200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":1397,"content":"<p>I fully agree that the relationship on the day between the driver tester and the customer is critical.  Everyone is entitled to be treated with integrity, dignity and so on.  We very much emphasise that in our training and when talking to driver testers to ensure that level of quality will be given to every customer who comes in.  Whether it is the first or the 20th time he or she has taken the test, it is essential the customer be treated with dignity and respect.<\/p> <p>  As for the standard, we have a quality assurance policy.  The initial phase of any quality assurance has to be the recruitment process, followed by the training and then the on-the-ground supervision that happens when testers are in their local test centres and assessing driving tests.  They are the individual steps and that is monitored monthly.  Of course there will be variation.  I have examined data from throughout the EU and it is a reality that there are variations in terms of pass rates.  Even in the case of the 2020 leaving certificate, there was a difference between the calculated grades and the exam results of previous years.  Every driving test is different.  There are different road, weather, pedestrian and traffic conditions.  I assure the Deputy, however, that for the RSA, the integrity of the test is really important and we fully agree with him in that regard.  Everything we do is to try to ensure the customer coming in the door will receive a fair, transparent test.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the taking on of driver testers, I would like to think that within the 18-month contract, the combination of training, supervision and so on will lead to a commitment on their behalf to be with us and to want to make a career with us in future if that opportunity arises for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Naughton"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":1398,"content":"<p>Is there a provision for the client to make an observation and to give feedback to the RSA on his or her experience with a tester?

I compliment them on the work they do.  Following on from the questions of Deputy Lowry in respect of testers, is it not time for testers to wear a body camera for their own protection as well as to provide feedback for the organisation with regard to how tests are being run?<\/p> <p>  The year before last, I took to the streets of Dublin on a bicycle purely because I had been critical of cyclists and was challenged to do it.  Cycling around the streets of Dublin was taking my life in my hands. It was absolutely frightening.  I compliment the Government and the various county councils on the greenways that are being put in place around the country.  Cycleways are needed desperately.  Bearing that in mind, is there any prospect of the RSA running cycle training courses in national schools?  I am thinking of a person or a group of people travelling around the country to deliver one-week programmes that would help kids to sort of get into the essentials of cycling.  It is not as simple as putting one's leg over the crossbar of a bicycle and taking off, although far too many people think that is what it is about.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Rowland addressed the issue of e-scooters.  I have serious concerns about them.  In my part of south Dublin, there are three or four people who commute on a single-wheel vehicle without handlebars.  I have no idea how they brake, take corners or anything else.  These vehicles have a single wheel.  The rider stands on a sort of a platform with one foot on either side of the wheel.  What is the legality of such vehicles?  Where do they fit in with regard to road safety?<\/p> <p>  Cars have changed drastically since my day when we had crash gearboxes and God knows what else.  Today, cars are such a gathering of technology that it is not funny.  All cars now have satellite systems, reversing cameras and parking sensors.  Cars have sensors such that the driver is warned of oncoming cars when opening the door and is warned when changing lanes.  When is the driving test going to be brought up to speed to meet the technology?  I sometimes think the technology might have reached a stage whereby it has lulled us into a false sense of security that we can do no wrong while behind the wheel of a car.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the employment of testers, I am aware that several former military people wish to move to the RSA.  They worked as highly skilled driving instructors in the military.  The issue of pension abatement has stopped them taking public service jobs.  Has the issue of pension abatement come across the desks of the witnesses at any stage?  <\/p> <p>  I thank them for their time and appreciate any answers they can give me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#J01800","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":1423,"content":"<p>I will take the questions relating to the driving test.

I am not in favour of bringing in body cameras because there are probably privacy issues to be considered.  It is a little more complex than might be thought at first blush.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of vehicle technology, I fully agree with the Senator that there is a need to look again at the driver test.  In fact, as recently as two weeks ago, this issue came up at an EU licensing committee meeting.  A new licensing directive will be brought into being in the next 18 months.  Some of the conversation at the meeting was certainly around how technology has changed driving and how we can adapt the test or the licensing process to take account of that.  That is certainly part of the thinking and will definitely see the light of day in the next 18 months or so. <\/p> <p>  Pension abatement has not really become an issue.  It may be the case that those who would be affected just did not apply in the first instance.  I am not aware of it as an issue in terms of it prohibiting people from taking up employment with the RSA but there is no doubt that if a person would lose some of their pension as a result of taking up another post, that would certainly be a deterring factor in terms of going for the post.

On the matter of e-scooters, and further to what Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Leddin and others said, where does Mr. Rowland see e-scooters fitting into the overall transport network of first-mile and last-mile solutions in five and ten years' time?  We seem to have been fighting long and hard for improved infrastructure for bikes, but in fairness there have been huge leaps forward on this in the past months.  E-scooter use has exploded in the last few years and months.  When we plan road safety policy and transport infrastructure, to what extend have e-scooters entered the conversation on how we will plan our cycle lanes, our safe lanes and our regional towns?  For example, I live in Swords and we are hoping at some stage to have a MetroLink.  I hope to be able to cycle or get an e-scooter from our home to a MetroLink stop that may be too close to drive to but too far to walk for a daily commute.  What conversations are taking place about five and ten year's down the line, and not just about this legislation?  If the use of e-scooters grows at the current rate, they will be incredibly common in our major towns and cities, as common as the use of bikes if not more so.  I am interested in Mr. Rowland's thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell referred to cycling in Dublin city.  Some 20 years ago I witnessed a cycling fatality in Dublin city.  It was a horrific thing to happen and to have witnessed.  It highlighted to me how unsafe our city is.  It is welcome to see cycle lanes developed but to what extent will they be improved and networked?  As with the pencil bollards, which are necessary for traffic segregation, what is the long-term plan for these lanes which are unsightly.  It would be great to see them replaced with a different type of segregation, perhaps a lower kerb, when other road users and particularly motorists are used to and accept the fact that cyclists have parity and need extra protection on our roads.

What is Mr. Rowland's perspective on where the PPTs should be allowed?  There is talk of them on cycle lanes and bus lanes and not being used on footpaths and not being allowed on national roads or motorways.  Greenways will be looked at separately.  Will Mr. Rowland go through those headings of speed, age limit, the need for a register and where they should be allowed to park and be used?  Mr. Rowland said they should be regulated by local authorities.  Should they be more properly regulated by the RSA or the NTA?

I do not disagree with that, but we suggest that 20 km\/h would be an even better speed limit.<\/p><p> On the age of users of powered vehicles, again, we felt that given that they can achieve quite significant speeds on the roads and that anybody under 16 would not have the necessary skill sets or abilities to use them in a safe manner.

The Deputy will understand if I say that we are not quite sure when we will get back to doing seven or eight tests a day because it depends on the progress of the suppression of the disease.
