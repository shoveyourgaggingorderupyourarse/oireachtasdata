I thank the committee for its invitation and look forward to assisting it in its pre-legislative scrutiny of the affordable housing Bill.<\/p> <p>  All local authorities, along with approved housing bodies, perform an extensive range of housing services, including a multibillion euro programme of new social housing construction across all parts of the country.  In the ten-year period up to 2008, local authorities delivered more than 26,000 affordable homes and they have extensive experience and knowledge of affordable housing as a result.<\/p> <p>  While the emphasis over the past number of years has been on social housing delivery, local authorities welcome the new affordable housing Bill.  Affordable housing delivers homes to middle-income earners facing housing affordability challenges.  When built along with social housing units, it enhances the sustainability of these communities.  The addition of cost-rental affordable housing to the delivery methods available to local authorities is also welcomed.<\/p> <p>  The majority of the Bill's provisions are amendments to Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  They relate to intended improvements in the areas of assessment of purchaser eligibility, scheme of priority, charging period and the role of the Land Development Agency.  Other key provisions cover cost-rental and the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  The CCMA is of the opinion that measures in the Bill, in particular heads 3 to 8, inclusive, will give greater clarity and certainty to both local authorities and prospective purchasers.<\/p> <p>  The primary delivery mechanism enabling local authorities to deliver affordable housing is the serviced site fund.  To date, funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 38 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 4,000 more affordable homes.  Of these 140 homes will be delivered this year, with an additional 700 in 2022 and a further 1,500 in 2023.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that the serviced site fund is provided to support the cost of infrastructure associated with the construction of new affordable purchase homes on local authority lands.  However, the financial ability of local authorities to deliver affordable housing at scale is dependent upon a simplified serviced site fund bridging the entire gap between the full cost of provision of housing by a local authority and the affordable selling price.  The CCMA and the housing delivery co-ordination office are in discussions with the Department in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The timeframe for the delivery of such projects must accommodate detailed design, the consultation process, planning, procurement and construction.  As with all large projects of this type, the nature and scale of the developments will generally evolve as plans are progressed by local authorities.  The provision of affordable housing by local authorities utilising funding via a simplified serviced site fund will allow local authorities progress development of larger mixed-tenure housing schemes delivering social, affordable purchase and affordable rental housing.<\/p> <p>  However, it should also be pointed out that local authorities are still dealing with the legacy of previous affordable housing programmes before 2011.  Currently local authorities have approximately 2,000 unsold affordable dwellings with associated unfunded costs of approximately &euro;350 million.  While all these dwellings are currently occupied as social housing units, these legacy issues require resolution.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities are currently assessing their remaining housing land banks and will be acquiring land over the next number of years upon which to further deliver social and affordable housing.  Consideration is required on how best to fund these land purchases in order not to disproportionately impact on other local authority general services.<\/p> <p>  The CCMA is of the opinion that local authorities are best placed to assess the level of demand for affordable housing in their functional areas.  It has been working with the Department on setting targets.<\/p> <p>  The CCMA welcomes the measures in the affordable housing Bill.  Coupled with the serviced site fund, it will allow local authorities deliver affordable housing in conjunction with the other suite of measures in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Curran"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Curran.

Cost-rental is the one that applies mostly for approved housing bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Alliance is a collaboration of six of Ireland&rsquo;s largest approved housing bodies, namely, Circle Voluntary Housing, Cl&uacute;id Housing, Co-operative Housing Ireland, Oaklee Housing, Respond and Tuath Housing.<\/p><p>The Housing Alliance was formed to promote the delivery of social and affordable housing, address barriers and challenges to delivery, and promote strong professional approaches to housing management.<\/p><p> We warmly welcome the cost rental scheme.  We await further clarity on receipt of full details of the conditions and will reflect on those details when received.  We have responded enthusiastically to the expression of interest for funding, which was oversubscribed, demonstrating the commitment of Housing Alliance members to contribute to the new initiative.  It is our contention that, in time, affordable cost rental will be seen as marking a significant and important development in housing policy.  It provides a long-term affordable housing solution for those households that choose to rent, with the advantages that this bestows on the wider economy.  The housing sector has lacked an affordable rental option for some time.  The provision of affordable cost rental homes is an important initiative for those households whose income falls between private and social rental.  It brings Ireland more in line with other European housing systems, which tend to have a cost rental element in their housing provision.<\/p><p> Many households become trapped in the private rented sector, unable to move to a more secure or affordable tenure, yet their incomes are above the threshold to qualify for social housing.  They are not earning sufficient income to purchase a home of their own.  The cost rental equity loan, CREL, represents a remedy at a critical juncture in housing policy.  While the initial 440 homes is a relatively small number, given the proportion of households in need of an affordable rental option, we believe that the success of this initial year will provide the evidence and demonstrate the value of significantly increasing recurring budgetary allocations to allow many more cost rental homes to be provided in future.<\/p><p> As is clear to everyone, housing affordability is an increasing challenge in the Irish context.  Without a secure place to call home, it can be challenging to engage in many aspects of life, including employment, education, training and recreation.  Never has the centrality of the home been more acute than during the Covid-19 crisis, with the call to action to stay home and stay safe.  For many households, having a secure home of their own is out of their reach and unaffordable.  For example, 16% of households spend more than 30% of their net income on housing, with this figure rising to 70% for the lowest quartile of the income distribution, according to ESRI research in 2018.  That study also found a variation in affordability in respect of age group, location and household formation.<\/p><p> In social and economic terms, lack of access to affordable housing impacts on family life, household job prospects, household finances, family formation as well as national competitiveness and growth.  Furthermore, according to most recent figures, the median gross income per household in Ireland was &euro;45,256 while nearly two thirds of Irish households had a gross income of less than &euro;60,000.  Despite marginal reductions in rents in recent months, market rents in Dublin city are still at almost &euro;2,000 per month, comprising more than 69% of the net income of a household on a gross income of &euro;45,000 and just over 56% of the net income of a household on a gross income of &euro;60,000.  Rents in other cities, including Cork and Galway, continue to rise at a rapid pace.<\/p><p> Cost rental housing in Ireland is providing discounted rental housing developed by approved housing bodies, AHBs, and local authorities; guaranteeing long-term security of tenure to tenants; charging rents of at least 25% below prevailing market rents, with affordability likely to increase over time; and assisting tenants with housing assistance payments, HAP, after six months should they temporarily lose employment.  As in other European countries, cost rental properties act to counter the boom and bust cycles that often plague the housing market.  For example, in Austria where two thirds of the population live in subsidised housing-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt, but we must keep opening statements to approximately five minutes each.

I thank Mr. Curran, Mr. Dunne and their teams for their presentations.  As somebody who has been a long-time advocate of local authority and approved housing body delivery of affordable rental and purchase accommodation, it is good that we are finally having these conversations.  I must say, however, that I do not believe any lack of ambition is on the part of the people who are in this meeting.  If central government does not provide significant funding from AHBs or councils to deliver affordable housing then we will not be able to deliver it.  It is important that committee members know there was no additional funding for the serviced sites fund in budget 2021 above pre-existing commitments.  Only &euro;35 million was allocated to the AHBs for cost rental whereas we need to be spending far greater sums of money over the next five years to meet the level of need that exists.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions, the first of which is for CCMA.  As we know, &euro;300 million was allocated for the serviced sites fund over three years to deliver more than 6,000 affordable homes by the end of 2021.  That obviously has not happened.  As was said, we will only get 140 this year, 700 next year and 1,500 the year after, and those are pre-Covid figures.  What needs to change to allow Mr. Curran to accelerate the drawdown and delivery of homes under that fund?  If the fund were to be increased, what is Mr. Curran's capacity to handle that?  We need thousands of these units every year, not hundreds.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Dunne and his colleagues on the success of the applications, the details of which I know we will get soon when they are announced, for the affordable cost rental scheme.  My concern here, however, is that it is a very small amount of money and a small number of units.  The real concern is the rent levels, however.  This is not a criticism of the Housing Alliance but a whole range of people will not be able to afford those rents, for example, single people or those on a modest dual income who are above the threshold for social housing.  What needs to happen in that scheme to drive the rents down below &euro;900, &euro;800 or &euro;700?  Are we going to see any units in the city centre given the price differential there?  We need to make sure these units get to the people who need them most.  We are hearing figures of &euro;1,100, &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 for rent on Land Development Agency, LDA, cost rental sites.  What does the Housing Alliance need from Government to bring rents down below the &euro;1,000 mark?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#C00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I will make an initial comment and then invite my colleague, Mr. O'Gorman, to answer.

Then there are other factors with regard to land cost and construction costs that feed into it.<\/p> <p>  Our initial responsibility is thinking about those who are in the current situation where they are paying &euro;2,000 per month, which I know all members care about.

We are obviously trying to drive down the rents as low we can.  We realise that the more we can drive those down, the bigger the pool of people that will be available to us.  We have tried to develop the properties in as reasonable and cost-effective a way as we can.  We have applied an affordability measure to our assessment of potential applicants.  We do not want anybody to spend more than 35% of his or her net income on rent because that just brings people into unaffordability and issues regarding rent arrears, debt and so on.  We have managed, therefore, to bring the rents between &euro;900 to approximately &euro;1,100 across the various schemes.<\/p> <p>  We hope the success this year, which we are anticipating, will deliver a permanent budget line in order that this will be something allocated year on year.

We hope to be able to drive that down further.<\/p> <p>  In addition to what Mr. Dunne said, the rents will be indexed to inflation, to consumer price index, CPI, which will be less than the increase in market rent.  Therefore, we expect that affordability will increase over time.  These are 40-year terms.  At the end of that 40 years, when they are available to other households, long after I have left the scene, we hope we can bring down the rents even further because the loans will have been paid back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will bring Mr. Curran in on that question of the serviced sites fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#C01000","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, the serviced sites fund covers infrastructure costs.

I welcome seeing Mr. Taaffe in this forum.  The representatives of both the CCMA and the Housing Alliance spoke about the benefit of delivering cost rental en masse in the context of rent affordability and to stabilise the housing sector.  I agree with this and the AHBs play a pivotal role in helping to reshape our housing market into one that is affordable and inclusive of all income levels.  In a previous committee meeting on this Bill it was suggested by the Housing Agency and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, that we require at least 2,000 cost rental units per year to stabilise the market and eventually drive down prices.  NESC also cited multiples of that figure, up to 6,000 units per year, as what we really needed.  Have the witnesses engaged with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on multiannual funding and access to local authority land, given that AHBs will have to deliver cost rental units on such a scale?<\/p> <p>  Second, we often cite the success of the Vienna model, which has exemplified the housing model centred on affordability.  In a recent meeting with the Austrian Green Party, which forms part of the Austrian Government with the Social Democratic Party, its members noted that every fourth flat in Vienna is city owned, with up to two thirds of the population in affordable and high-quality public housing.  That includes high-income earners.  Only about 20% of people own their own homes in Vienna.  That is not because house prices are expensive, but because of the significant investment in delivery of public housing as well as the evident rental culture that exists there.  What is the witnesses' perspective on the lease terms and the provisions we need?  Would they support leases of indefinite duration, considering the State's current six-year lease terms?<\/p> <p>  Finally, in order to maintain cost rental as a non-profit driven model, do they agree that cost rental rents should be priced on the construction and maintenance and capped at a profit of 3%, akin to the Vienna model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#D01000","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The first question was on engagement with the Department to allow AHBs to provide at scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#D01100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Yes, at scale.

It is interesting to hear about the NESC report with regard to 2,000 per annum.  We also hear about the 440 in the CREL scheme.  Ms Keenan has outlined that the Shanganagh scheme will have 306.  We are quickly approaching at least 50% of that target, and that is encouraging.  However, this is very much the beginning, the initial phase where we all need to prove this model, be satisfied and improve it.  There are opportunities to improve it as we proceed.  Certainly, the Enniskerry Road project was the initial pathfinder project and we have learned from that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of engagement with the Department about the funding and scaling up the model, the Housing Alliance has raised this.  I represent the alliance on the delivery group that the Minister chairs and we have raised two matters.  One is the need for us to get on with this and prove its viability, and then to make the case to the Department for future budget allocations to scale it up.  We have also highlighted the importance of the request for expressions of interest to be made much earlier.  We had expressions of interest late in December and we are delivering most of this in this year, and that is quite a tight timeline.  We believe it is important that it might happen in August and September while there is the parallel process of the Department making its submissions to the Government about budgetary allocations.  There is no doubt that is important.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of classification, we are actively involved in making an effort to reverse classification.  We are optimistic about doing that.  We are having conversations with National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Government about it.  We believe it is entirely possible for us to address it.  The Senator's comments were well made and they must be addressed.  We are working hard to address them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the elements that go into the cost, we agree that the profit element of this must be reduced as much as possible.  The purpose of this is to keep the cost down.  I cannot see how involving private sector actors or investors is going to keep those costs down when they are required and entitled to a make a substantial return on investments in order to get the investments they need.<\/p><p>Between the local authorities, the AHBs and the LDA, we would be optimistic that the State could adequately do this, that we are adequately placed to do it and that we are focused on the lowest possible rents for tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>What about indefinite tenures?

The wonderful thing about the model is that the houses are paid for once and that cost might be repaid over 25 years, and then those homes are available at no additional cost in the remaining 75 years, except for maintenance.

I ask the witnesses to comment on that because it is critical and many people miss it.  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Ms Keenan represents D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and she will be aware of the costs there.  Wherever we go in the country, there is a different impact in respect of affordability and we must address this key issue.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of time and I want to stick to a few questions.  The Minister announced 390 new cost rental units and I see that members of the Housing Alliance, namely, Cl&uacute;id Housing, Respond and Tuath, have been involved in some of those endeavours.  Of those 390 cost rental units, will the witnesses confirm that 50 of those units are already accounted for as part of the Enniskerry Road project?  Mr. Curran mentioned the issue of acquisition.  I am taken aback by that.  We know a number of local authorities have a legacy regarding the land aggregation scheme.  Nothing has happened in that regard.  That legacy needs to be brought into play in respect of affordability.  I accept there is a need for mixed tenure.  I would like to hear what the CCMA is doing in that context because there has been no mention of it.<\/p> <p>  I was somewhat surprised by what I thought was a bland statement from the CCMA this morning.  I had expected it to have been a bit more ambitious.  I am not suggesting the association is not ambitious but I did not see ambition reflected in its statement.  In the greater scheme of things regarding this proposed Bill, the witnesses might also comment on the LDA and how it will interact with the local authorities.  I know for certain from talking to city and county councillors around the country that they have serious concerns about the proposed adjustments to the section 183 disposal system.  The witnesses and anyone who works in the local authorities will know there are many good reasons that elected members may decide not to release land to the LDA, while there are also many other reasons that they would do so.

The LDA has a number of schemes coming through around the country, with some of those deriving from the land aggregation scheme, such as those in Naas and Lusk and also a scheme now coming through in Cork.

If the approach is that of some flexibility, how would that be worked out?  I ask the witnesses for more detail on that.<\/p> <p>  Part of the process of achieving housing affordability must focus on driving down the costs of delivery and construction.  Is the CCMA considering that aspect?  Has the possibility of more universal internal design been considered to achieve economies of scale, for example, in procuring internal fittings?  I do not believe universal external design is desirable or a good idea.<\/p> <p>  Is the cost procurement process being examined to see what might be done to lower the costs of construction?  There have been issues with some larger developments, for example.  If they have not been broken up, only a couple of large developers bid in the tender process.  The resultant lack of competition has been driving up costs.  Has consideration been given to breaking up some of the bigger projects so that smaller bidders can make bids?  That would then bring costs down.  Does that form part of the work being done on the serviced sites fund?  That is one way of bridging the affordability gap.

I have a couple of questions for the witnesses from the CCMA.  Mr. Mark Bourke from Dublin City Council told us about the problems local authorities have in comparison with the private sector in delivering housing.  In some cases, the process they have to go through can see construction taking six years.  In the context of the affordable housing Bill, are the witnesses speaking to the Department about the steps and processes that take place between local authorities and the Department in regard to the provision of funding?  Where does the CCMA see the longer delays arising in local authority delivery of social housing?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Curran said that he is talking to the Department about additional funding under the serviced sites fund.  What type of infrastructure is he talking about in this regard?  Is he referring to enhanced infrastructure?  In the case of the Dublin local authorities, for example, when it comes to building anything like playgrounds, parks and other facilities that build communities beyond the bricks and mortar of housing, they often feel that they are forced to sell land in order to get the money to provide that enhanced infrastructure.  Is there any case being made to the Department for funding of enhanced infrastructure, which currently is not covered?<\/p> <p>  How does the CCMA see the issue of guaranteed affordability in regard to purchase prices?  In the case of O'Devaney Gardens, for instance, some of the affordable housing units cost more than &euro;400,000.  What steps can the Department or the CCMA take in terms of the procurement process to bring that price down?  Following on from what Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, where there are one or two builders on large sites, local authorities are often forced to take what those builders say is an affordable unit.  Are there any steps that can be incorporated into the affordable housing Bill to enable direct dealing with small builders in order to reduce the cost of the affordable purchase element of schemes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#F00700","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>In regard to delays, we have had many discussions with the Department down through the years about the approval process.

In more recent years, we have been working on the design-build process, which has shortened that.  In Wicklow, we are delivering schools through design-build and the initial process is taking 43 to 45 weeks, which is a significant improvement.

We are having ongoing discussions in this regard and there is a recognition from the Department that where there is a community deficit of infrastructure associated with particular housing schemes, a level of funding to address it should be provided under those schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Taaffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Senator Moynihan's time is up but I may be able to bring her back in on the second round.

With the legacy issues, is a full write-down of loans required or what must be done to get rid of the burden on local authorities caused by these loans?  The opening statement indicated that in the ten-year period to 2008, local authorities delivered over 26,000 affordable homes but 2,000 of those were unsold.  What lessons can be learned from this?  Has there been an analysis of the 24,000 homes that were sold to see if the tenants felt they had a good or fair deal and what changes would be made if we were in a similar position now?  How would the CCMA envisage the process of determining the price of an affordable home under the proposed scheme?<\/p> <p>  The Housing Alliance statement referenced cost rental prices and the relation to market rates.  Would it consider market rates to determine cost rental rates as appropriate?  There are areas where current market rates are extremely or excessively high.  Should the cost rental affordability calculation be done on the median wage in those areas so as to make these properties affordable for people?  There was an announcement for a proposed cost rental scheme on the St. Kevin's site, with rates between &euro;900 and &euro;1,100, but for most people that is not affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#G01600","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>We are looking at the legacy loans, as I mentioned earlier.  The first step is to look at all those land banks and see what can be developed for social and affordable housing.  That is the best way to deal with it.  At the end of that exercise, there may well be land that is unlikely to be developed for various reasons, and the type of discussion we are having with the Department and the Housing Finance Agency is on how to clear those loans.  There are a number of options.  There could be another scheme.  The loans could be cleared by the Department or paid over time.  There could be an arrangement between ourselves, the local authorities, the Department and the Housing Finance Agency.  That is all up for discussion and we are analysing all those land banks.<\/p> <p>  On the unsold affordable housing units, there were 29,000 units built and the vast majority of people are very happy with the deal they got.  We get that information anecdotally.  Despite the scale of the crash, which was unprecedented in Ireland, only 2,000 remained unsold.  Those that were unsold are now fully occupied by social housing tenants.  They were leased to approved housing bodies and occupied by social housing tenants.  The lease then paid the loan.  We are in a position now where we must look at what to do with those loans.  We are looking at whether we should continue and transfer them to the approved housing body or what is the best way to deal with that.  There is a working group between the Department and ourselves that is looking to resolve that matter.<\/p><p>On affordability, the way it is set out in the Bill is that if somebody can afford a mortgage to purchase a house on the private market, he or she will not be eligible.

If there is an affordable housing scheme available, it will be advertised, people will apply, they will be assessed on their length of time living in the area, the suitability of the house and when they applied.  Rather than going into distance from home to work and home to school which is cumbersome and inconsistent around the country, it simplifies it.  The plan is to have 70% of units allocated on those priorities and then 20% through a local scheme which local councils will arrive at.  That is very welcome.  The clarification around the charging period is welcome.  We have been in discussion with the Department on the serviced site fund and expanding it, which would be very useful.  There is a question of what happens to unsold affordable units, whether they transfer to social housing, for instance, as is effectively the case now.  That is something we need to consider.  If there is a change of circumstances while we are building these units, there needs to be consideration of what happens if the houses are not sold.  Acquiring land is a big issue.  It is a big outlay for us.  Currently, we recoup those funds when we start building, which is effectively stage 4 of the four-stage approval process which I mentioned.

What is the focus of this entire thing?  It is about providing a housing solution that is affordable for people who find themselves in the situation where the price of private rental is far too high, they cannot afford to buy a house and their income is above the social housing level.  The test of the success of this will be whether or not it provides for those people.  That is our objective and what we are trying to achieve.  My opening statement referred to the challenges faced by a high percentage of people who are unable to rent or buy on average incomes, and who do not have access to social housing.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  Everything we do is done in partnership with local authorities.  Whether it is social or cost rental, our first point of call is the local authority.  We discuss the housing need and demand in the area and what the local authority wants us to do and where we can help.  We do not see ourselves as the primary mover in housing in Ireland.  Local authorities develop the development plan, it is the planning and housing authority in that county, and our role is to assist when invited and when it is helpful for them to have us there.<\/p> <p>  For the people who live in those counties, whose rent we are trying to address, we are trying to match two things, namely what they can afford to pay and how we can drive the cost down as far as we possibly can, through reducing our own costs around housing management, buying at the best price, buying at fixed prices and using modern construction methods.  AHBs have been involved in modular house building in 2D and 3D designs and we are trying to do this.  There is no doubt we can improve on it and that we want to improve on it but we do work with the private sector, and we drive as hard a bargain as we can.  My organisation has 1,366 homes in construction.  That means we have the skill set to be able to tell the private sector that we know what we are doing; we know the costs, we know what we pay and we will only pay the absolute minimum.<\/p><p>The Senator has raised the issue of the real challenge, which is the gap between the cost of housing and land in Ireland and what people can afford to pay.

I wish to make a couple of comments and then pose two specific questions.  There is a lot of talk about ambition and targets, particularly from committee members, which is good, but let us all just remind ourselves that targets will only be set in accordance with the funding provided.  Unless the Government invests more than &euro;50 million in the serviced sites fund and &euro;35 million in the CREL scheme, we will not see the local authorities or AHBs expand their ambition.  We need to be realistic about this.  If we want ambition, it will have to be matched by funding.  Otherwise, the stuff does not get built.<\/p> <p>  I support Deputy McAuliffe's call for mixed income AHB developments.  Of course, the easiest way to do this is to allow the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, to be used by AHBs for mixed social and affordable rental schemes.  They have been calling for that for years and neither the previous Minister nor the current one has agreed to it.  If the Deputy has any influence with his party colleague and he wants to make sure this is delivered, he should use it.  Let us not have two separate funds.  Let us allow the AHBs to have one fund to deliver exactly the kinds of schemes Deputy McAuliffe is rightly calling for.<\/p> <p>  On the target setting, Mr. Curran is being very generous to the Department.  The methodology for the housing needs demand assessment has not actually been produced by the Department yet.  Local authorities are drawing up their development plans without this methodology.  I know from my own local authority, South Dublin, that the development plan will be finished before that methodology is complete and issued.  Again, if we want our local authorities to set targets, the Department should give them the methodology for these exercises before they complete their development plans.  If anybody has any influence on that, it would be very helpful.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to price because ultimately, all of this comes down to what price people are paying.  Let us take the example of a two-bedroom unit renting at &euro;1,200 and a family over the threshold for social housing in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area.  A family with a gross household income of &euro;38,000 or &euro;39,000 paying &euro;1,200 in rent will be left with a weekly income of &euro;490.  Trying to raise two children, for example, on a weekly income of &euro;490 is simply not acceptable so we have to find ways of bringing rents down for those people or raising the social housing threshold.  What can be done to bring rents down further?<\/p> <p>  In terms of house prices, the guide price we are hearing is about &euro;250,000 and that is before the shared equity element of the serviced sites fund is taken into account; it is after that discount.  The average Rebuilding Ireland home loan in Dublin is &euro;200,000, so again, what we can do to bring those costs down in order that the above-average income worker can get the finance to purchase a home, even with the serviced sites equity element built in, at a price that is affordable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#L00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>In terms of bringing the costs down to make units affordable, it goes back to what we said earlier in terms of value for money, using design and build, building units at scale, looking at the design in terms of standard layouts that will drive the costs down while still maintaining good architectural quality, and things like going through frameworks with the Office of Government Procurement.  All of that will help to drive costs down.  Obviously, expanding the serviced sites fund will also help.  There are a number of things that can be done.  The situation is similar with regard to cost rental because the level of rent depends on the cost of construction, operation and maintenance.  If we can lower those costs, we can lower the rent.  People can get a significant discount.  I know that in Dublin, in places like D&uacute;n Laoghaire, rents of &euro;1,700 per month are being paid and if they come down to between &euro;900 and &euro;1,200, that is a very significant reduction.

It is to be hoped that kind of unitary model between social and cost rental will be where we eventually end up.  In some ways, it has been a long time coming.

We are starting from a very low base.  Ideally, we are trying to achieve on the cost rental what housing associations have achieved on the social rental.

We want to see that kind of model into the future, where we build up the stock of rental accommodation which will, over time, as a number of members have said, drive down the cost and bring that stability to the market so that we do not get these huge hikes and falls in rent but rather have much more stability and drive down the cost for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021030200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses.

There is nothing we could do without the support of local authorities.  It is their plans for their counties that determine our role in them.

We are a relatively small player in terms of the State itself, the role of local authorities and the councillors in that area, which we accept.

I thank committee members most sincerely for the opportunity to speak to them this morning and to discuss the pre-legislative scrutiny of the road traffic Bill and delays in driver licence renewals and driver tests caused by the current Covid-19 pandemic.  I am joined virtually by some of my senior leadership team, which was noted by the Chair, and together we will endeavour to answer committee members' questions.  We have submitted a full briefing note on the issues under discussion.  I do not propose to read it in full but I would like to highlight the main points in the interest of addressing key concerns which committee members may have.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the road traffic Bill, as members know, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced on 1 February the Government's approval to draft legislation which addresses several road traffic and road safety related issues.  The main provisions of the Bill include legislation around the use of e-scooters and e-bikes.  In addition to the legislation relating to e-scooters and e-bikes, the Bill will also include revision of legislation regarding the giving of driver instruction for reward, the introduction of a new power of the Road Safety Authority to revoke a driver licence and legislation for autonomous vehicles on Irish roads.  <\/p> <p>  The RSA welcomes the Bill and its provisions and looks forward to more details being published.  It also goes without saying that we are available to participate in future detailed pre-legislative scrutiny at a time decided by the committee.<\/p> <p>  The following summarises the situation regarding RSA services and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on them.  I will begin with the driver theory test.<\/p><p>The extension of Covid-19 level 5 restrictions by Government, until at least 5 April, means that the driver theory test continues to be suspended.  More than 80,000 driver theory test appointments in place over the coming months are now being rescheduled because the suspension of the service is being extended.  We are very much focused, in line with Government advice, on meeting the demand to restore pre-Covid waiting times when the service reopens.<br\/><br\/>We have plans to significantly increase capacity within the service when it can reopen.  This includes increasing capacity from an average of 15,000 tests per calendar month to 50,000 tests per calendar month when the service resumes.  This increased capacity will be available from mid-April 2021.  In addition to this, we are working on rolling out an online driver theory test service called ProProctor.  This was trialled in December and January for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses.  The pilot is now being evaluated and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is committed to extending the service for all theory test types during 2021. <br\/><br\/>Regarding driver licences and the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, announced details of a further extension to the expiry dates of driver licences on 24 February, as have other EU member states.  The extension will apply to different groups of licence holders, including those who benefited from previous extensions in 2020.  Drivers can see if they qualify for the extension by using the expiry date calculator onthe website <i>ndls.ie<\/i>.  Entering the expiry date printed on a driver licence into the calculator will tell a driver the new expiry date.  The RSA has told Insurance Ireland and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the extension to the driver licences.<br\/><br\/>Processing times for driver licences are taking longer than usual at the moment with standard applications processed within a 12 to 15 day average as opposed to the normal three to five day average.  This is due to higher volumes of applications, inclusion of a postal option for those aged over 70 and more complex Brexit-related cases.  The introduction of the extension to expiry dates of licences will result in reduced applications.  We are undertaking a number of measures with the service provider which will improve the rate of processing and we anticipate that turnaround times will return to normal levels shortly.<br\/><br\/>For those who need to apply for a licence or a learner permit, the NDLS centres remain open for essential workers.  In addition, our online application service <i>ndls.ie<\/i>has been successfully rolled out and those with a public service card and a verified MyGovID account can apply for their licence or permit online.  To date, in 2020, more than 40% of customers have applied online.<br\/><br\/>I know members are anxious about the backlog that is building up in the driver testing service so I will provide an update on this.  From the outset, we should not underestimate the impact Covid-19 has had on the driver test and the challenges faced by RSA driver testers to deliver the driver test safely during this global pandemic.  The RSA's priority is the safety of its staff, test environment and customers.  We have strict public health protocols in place to achieve this and, to date, since reopening in July 2020, we have conducted almost 90,000 driver tests.  The service is being delivered safely and in line with public health advice.  Our driver testers are working to test people in cars, trucks and buses so that supply chains can remain open and those deemed as essential under regulations can continue to provide their essential work.  I must commend our testers on their commitment to road safety and to delivering a vital public service at this time.<br\/><br\/>The waiting time for a driver test, pre-pandemic, was six weeks.  As a result of Covid-19, the suspension of services for more than four months and ongoing restrictions have all generated significant backlogs.  The extension of Covid-19 level 5 restrictions by Government until at least 5 April means that the driver test service can only deliver driver tests to essential workers.  Since we can only test essential workers, we are not able to fill all our available capacity so most recently circa 25% of driver test slots are going unused.  We expect this to persist during level 5 restrictions.<br\/><br\/>It is not possible to provide waiting times for the driver test because the service is not operating as normal.  As tests are only available to essential workers and we have surplus capacity we can offer test slots to essential workers almost on demand.  What we can say is that we have 98,414 applications on hand and of these 5,670 hold a test appointment in the coming weeks while 62,024 are waiting for a test.  The remaining 30,720 are ineligible for a test.  Those who are ineligible are generally customers who have not completed mandatory lessons.<br\/><br\/>If all customers who are eligible to be tested at present, that is, if there were no restrictions, were offered a test appointment in chronological order, we estimate that the average waiting time would be more than 20 weeks.  The RSA is making good progress in recruiting an additional 40 driver testers sanctioned by the Minister of State and our expectation is they will be available to conduct tests by the end of June 2021.  In addition to the existing complement of 138 driver testers, this will add much-needed capacity to the service.<br\/><br\/>However, this will not be enough to get waiting times down to the service level commitment of an average of ten weeks. The RSA is submitting further proposals to the Department of Transport seeking approval for an additional number of driver testers, on a temporary basis, to tackle the backlog.  <br\/><br\/>The RSA launched a new customer portal, <i>MyRoadSafety.ie,<\/i>on 30 November 2020.  It is a one-stop shop for all RSA services.  Initial teething problems with the new system led to issues for our driver test customers, in particular long call waiting times to access our customer care centre, CCC.  This was compounded by the large number of customers contacting us looking for a driver test date.  We have assigned additional resources to our customer call centre and reduced the call waiting times by more than 50%.  However, volumes are continuing at high levels with driver testing wait times being the main query.  We continue to improve this service.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to take questions from the Chair and committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sam Waide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Waide.

According to my analysis of the figures, there are roughly 68,000 people awaiting tests, 5,670 of whom have appointments as essential workers.  There are a further 30,720 who are awaiting the approved driver test hours from instructors.  There are just short of 100,000 people in the mix awaiting driver tests.

Clearly, with further level 5 restrictions during October to November, and also from late December to now going on to April, much more fundamental measures are needed.  Over the last month or six weeks, we have engaged with the service provider, Prometric, to see how to bring back the waiting times and meet the demand that is there.  The puzzle that is now signed off on is that the capacity will be doubled over those coming months.  The plan initially had been that if we were back up and running on 5 March, that for the months of April, May and June, potentially, 50,000 tests could be delivered in each of those months.  That is pushed out now obviously because we will not be back up and running until April.  If we look at the number of people who have test appointments at the moment, the number is a little over 82,000.  What that extra capacity will do is generate slots into the system that either new people can apply for or in the case of existing people who have slots up to October and November of this year, they can pull back and apply for another earlier slot during the year.  They are both options that are available to either existing candidates or new people wishing for an appointment.

They do their lessons and are ready to go on the day.  The critical issue is that they have certainty on when a test date will come up for them.

It is a resource issue and a matter for the Government in how we allocate resources to the driving test as against other services.

Consideration needs to be given to the proliferation of these scooters where there are interactions with heavy goods vehicles.  Importantly, we have also highlighted the need for these devices not to be used on footpaths where there are vulnerable road users or pedestrians.  We have also made recommendations on the age limits of who can, and should, use these vehicles.  In line with that, we have recommended that the age limit should be 16 or older.  We have suggested that maximum speed limits of 20 km\/h should be considered for these devices.  We have also made recommendations to the Minister and the Department on the use of personal protection equipment, PPE, and in particular, the use of helmets, considering the differing characteristics that these devices have when compared with the traditional bicycle in respect of the stability of the vehicle and while encountering uneven road surfaces.

He wants to be a paramedic more than anything.  To be a paramedic, one must have a full licence.  It is a requirement of enrolment into college, which is unique for any third level course.  He has applied for a B category theory test, and has a date for the test in May 2021.  Going on current waiting lists, it could be well into August before he could provisionally obtain his full licence.  With such a delay, he will not get his college place.  He is already looking at plan B and the possibility of taking a year out.  It is ludicrous that a delay in obtaining a driving licence would inhibit a 17-year-old who is planning a career as a paramedic in such a way.  It is a front-line health service profession.  The issue must be looked at.  There are a number of students in this predicament, right throughout the country.

It might be desirable and something that their family wants for them, but it is not essential.  It is a requirement for someone who wants to undertake a course to become a paramedic.  That sets them quite apart from other students.  We all want to see young people get their driving licences but this situation sets these students apart from others in their age cohort.<\/p> <p>  The next issue I wish to raise it that of BE licences, which are required for towing dual-axis trailers.  Many people in rural Ireland, for example, farmers towing cow or horseboxes, use and require such licences.  A farmer from County Clare recently told me that when his licence came up for renewal, he submitted all the paperwork.  Lo and behold, when he got back his licence, the capacity to tow a trailer had been removed from it.  He went to the ends of the earth in trying to get an answer, and was told that there is a minuscule box on the form asking the licence holder if he or she wishes to keep their trailer licence on renewal of the driving licence.  That goes against the whole spirit of licence renewal.  The whole idea of renewing a licence is that the holder of a licence running close to its expiry date applies for it to be renewed and extended.  There are a number of cases, but not many, such as that to which I referred.  Those who have lost their BE licences in such circumstances, should have them reinstated immediately.  It is most unfair on farmers, and those in rural Ireland, in particular.

Perhaps they did not tick the box when completing the form.  However, that would not prevent them from going back and reinstating it on their licence.  Certainly, in the NDLS, when a person attends the office, the agent behind the counter will tell actually that person that he or she has other categories on the licence and will ask him or her if he or she wishes to renew them as well.

This is a huge issue throughout Ireland, and in particular in rural Ireland and my constituency of Tipperary.  Many of the general questions I had wished to ask have been asked and I will not repeat them.  The delays are causing significant problems for young people especially and have implications for jobs, the economy and insurance premiums being levied on young people while they await a test.  As I understand it from the figures, 68,000 people are awaiting a test, 30,000 are in the process of taking lessons, and 80,000 are awaiting the theory test.  It might be too much to ask but do our guests have the figures to hand for the waiting lists in Tipperary?  If not, I would appreciate it if they forwarded them to me.<\/p> <p>  I have a slight concern about the issue of testers.  Additional testers are needed, but given that many of them will work part time, I worry about their commitment to the job.  I am looking at this in the context of standardisation across the system.  It is not unusual for me to be told by a person who has taken a test that he or she had a stickler of a tester.  There seems to be a variation in the reactions of people who have taken a test.  Some of them find the test person to have been very nice and approachable and tell me he or she understood that they were nervous, treated them with care and gave them the kind of attention they deserve, whereas in other cases, people have told me that the tester was not nice to them.  For instance, I know of one tester who failed five people in one week, each of whom had been through lessons and had done the necessary preparation.  How are tests benchmarked within the RSA system?  How does the RSA ensure an equal standard across the system?  I am concerned about that number of people being brought in on a temporary, 18-month contract.  How can it be guaranteed that a temporary tester will be as good or as qualified as someone who is permanent and has been working within the system for years?<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome the submission that Mr. Rowland made in respect of e-scooters.

Whether it is the first or the 20th time he or she has taken the test, it is essential the customer be treated with dignity and respect.<\/p> <p>  As for the standard, we have a quality assurance policy.  The initial phase of any quality assurance has to be the recruitment process, followed by the training and then the on-the-ground supervision that happens when testers are in their local test centres and assessing driving tests.  They are the individual steps and that is monitored monthly.  Of course there will be variation.  I have examined data from throughout the EU and it is a reality that there are variations in terms of pass rates.  Even in the case of the 2020 leaving certificate, there was a difference between the calculated grades and the exam results of previous years.  Every driving test is different.  There are different road, weather, pedestrian and traffic conditions.  I assure the Deputy, however, that for the RSA, the integrity of the test is really important and we fully agree with him in that regard.  Everything we do is to try to ensure the customer coming in the door will receive a fair, transparent test.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the taking on of driver testers, I would like to think that within the 18-month contract, the combination of training, supervision and so on will lead to a commitment on their behalf to be with us and to want to make a career with us in future if that opportunity arises for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Naughton"},{"type":"speech","time":1614643200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Is there a provision for the client to make an observation and to give feedback to the RSA on his or her experience with a tester?

I compliment them on the work they do.  Following on from the questions of Deputy Lowry in respect of testers, is it not time for testers to wear a body camera for their own protection as well as to provide feedback for the organisation with regard to how tests are being run?<\/p> <p>  The year before last, I took to the streets of Dublin on a bicycle purely because I had been critical of cyclists and was challenged to do it.  Cycling around the streets of Dublin was taking my life in my hands. It was absolutely frightening.  I compliment the Government and the various county councils on the greenways that are being put in place around the country.  Cycleways are needed desperately.  Bearing that in mind, is there any prospect of the RSA running cycle training courses in national schools?  I am thinking of a person or a group of people travelling around the country to deliver one-week programmes that would help kids to sort of get into the essentials of cycling.  It is not as simple as putting one's leg over the crossbar of a bicycle and taking off, although far too many people think that is what it is about.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Rowland addressed the issue of e-scooters.  I have serious concerns about them.  In my part of south Dublin, there are three or four people who commute on a single-wheel vehicle without handlebars.  I have no idea how they brake, take corners or anything else.  These vehicles have a single wheel.  The rider stands on a sort of a platform with one foot on either side of the wheel.  What is the legality of such vehicles?  Where do they fit in with regard to road safety?<\/p> <p>  Cars have changed drastically since my day when we had crash gearboxes and God knows what else.  Today, cars are such a gathering of technology that it is not funny.  All cars now have satellite systems, reversing cameras and parking sensors.  Cars have sensors such that the driver is warned of oncoming cars when opening the door and is warned when changing lanes.  When is the driving test going to be brought up to speed to meet the technology?  I sometimes think the technology might have reached a stage whereby it has lulled us into a false sense of security that we can do no wrong while behind the wheel of a car.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the employment of testers, I am aware that several former military people wish to move to the RSA.  They worked as highly skilled driving instructors in the military.  The issue of pension abatement has stopped them taking public service jobs.  Has the issue of pension abatement come across the desks of the witnesses at any stage?  <\/p> <p>  I thank them for their time and appreciate any answers they can give me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#J01800","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1614643200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I will take the questions relating to the driving test.  I know there are other questions relating to cycling and e-scooters.<\/p> <p>  The issue when it comes to the usage of body cameras is the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I am not in favour of bringing in body cameras because there are probably privacy issues to be considered.  It is a little more complex than might be thought at first blush.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of vehicle technology, I fully agree with the Senator that there is a need to look again at the driver test.  In fact, as recently as two weeks ago, this issue came up at an EU licensing committee meeting.  A new licensing directive will be brought into being in the next 18 months.  Some of the conversation at the meeting was certainly around how technology has changed driving and how we can adapt the test or the licensing process to take account of that.  That is certainly part of the thinking and will definitely see the light of day in the next 18 months or so. <\/p> <p>  Pension abatement has not really become an issue.  It may be the case that those who would be affected just did not apply in the first instance.  I am not aware of it as an issue in terms of it prohibiting people from taking up employment with the RSA but there is no doubt that if a person would lose some of their pension as a result of taking up another post, that would certainly be a deterring factor in terms of going for the post.

On the matter of e-scooters, and further to what Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Leddin and others said, where does Mr. Rowland see e-scooters fitting into the overall transport network of first-mile and last-mile solutions in five and ten years' time?  We seem to have been fighting long and hard for improved infrastructure for bikes, but in fairness there have been huge leaps forward on this in the past months.  E-scooter use has exploded in the last few years and months.  When we plan road safety policy and transport infrastructure, to what extend have e-scooters entered the conversation on how we will plan our cycle lanes, our safe lanes and our regional towns?  For example, I live in Swords and we are hoping at some stage to have a MetroLink.  I hope to be able to cycle or get an e-scooter from our home to a MetroLink stop that may be too close to drive to but too far to walk for a daily commute.  What conversations are taking place about five and ten year's down the line, and not just about this legislation?  If the use of e-scooters grows at the current rate, they will be incredibly common in our major towns and cities, as common as the use of bikes if not more so.  I am interested in Mr. Rowland's thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell referred to cycling in Dublin city.  Some 20 years ago I witnessed a cycling fatality in Dublin city.  It was a horrific thing to happen and to have witnessed.  It highlighted to me how unsafe our city is.  It is welcome to see cycle lanes developed but to what extent will they be improved and networked?  As with the pencil bollards, which are necessary for traffic segregation, what is the long-term plan for these lanes which are unsightly.  It would be great to see them replaced with a different type of segregation, perhaps a lower kerb, when other road users and particularly motorists are used to and accept the fact that cyclists have parity and need extra protection on our roads.

The Minister has indicated that he will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to deal with the whole issue of e-scooters and e-bikes.  Could I get a summary under a couple of headings?  I understand that a speed of 25 km\/h is being considered.  The RSA has put in 20 km\/h.  It has not yet decided on an age limit.  Will Mr. Rowland elaborate on why the RSA believe the age of 16 and over is important?  It will not be classified in any way.  Is there a need for a register for these types of personal powered transport vehicles, PPTs, that are coming in?  What about the whole area of where they are allowed to be used?<\/p> <p>  I am amazed that more cyclists are not killed in Dublin.  I often get a bus or a taxi to Heuston Station and I am amazed at what I see.  While it is hugely positive to see so many cyclists, it is certainly an area that requires a duty of care from cyclists and from drivers so that nothing happens.  What is Mr. Rowland's perspective on where the PPTs should be allowed?  There is talk of them on cycle lanes and bus lanes and not being used on footpaths and not being allowed on national roads or motorways.  Greenways will be looked at separately.  Will Mr. Rowland go through those headings of speed, age limit, the need for a register and where they should be allowed to park and be used?  Mr. Rowland said they should be regulated by local authorities.  Should they be more properly regulated by the RSA or the NTA?  The rapid growth in the number of these e-scooters and e-bikes, as mentioned by Deputy Smith, is quite amazing.  It is a positive feature but there are elements to their use that cause severe worry with regard to safety.

Given the vulnerability of road users and that these are unprotected vehicles, we felt that a 20 km\/h speed limit was an appropriate one for consideration.  I know the Minister suggested 25 km\/h.  I do not disagree with that, but we suggest that 20 km\/h would be an even better speed limit.<\/p><p> On the age of users of powered vehicles, again, we felt that given that they can achieve quite significant speeds on the roads and that anybody under 16 would not have the necessary skill sets or abilities to use them in a safe manner.  It is important that whoever uses them has the ability to use them and we were concerned that children could get their hands on these vehicles and that they could be seen as a toy when in actual fact they are a means of transport.

In summary, we ask that details of all the test centres and waiting times nationally, broken down by county and centre, be provided to the committee.  Second, we would like to get a copy of the RSA submission to the Minister on the e-scooter legislation.  I also have asked Mr. Naughton to provide details on the number of extra driving testers needed to bring the waiting time down from ten weeks to two weeks.  Finally, the committee will write to the Minister about two issues.  The first is the 40 additional testers that are required to bring the number up to 80 new testers, so that there is a complement of 218 testers.  Second, we will also contact the Minister about the anomaly whereby essential workers can go for tests, but are awaiting the approved driver test hours.  It is a hugely important issue to which we will return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021030200002#N00700","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1614643200,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 12.02 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
