With a significant number of other leaders, I supported an ambitious and balanced approach, capable of meeting the scale of the challenges we are facing and equipping the EU well for the future. That is what was agreed.<\/p>  <p>  In my interventions, in addition to seeking to ensure an ambitious package &ndash; one that enables us to deliver our priorities as a Union &ndash; I made it clear that I would only support an outcome in which Ireland&rsquo;s interests were secured, including in relation to the CAP and Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  That is reflected in the outcome on both MFF and the Next Generation EU recovery fund, which are well aligned with Government priorities as set out in the Programme for Government. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the significant downward pressure on the budget, and the poor starting point as set out in the Commission&rsquo;s original proposal for the MFF, the outcome succeeds in protecting the CAP, including through the provision of a special allocation of &euro;300m for Ireland to reflect the challenges facing the sector here. <\/p>  <p>  In further support for peace and reconciliation, the EU will provide a special allocation of &euro;120 million to the PEACE PLUS programme. Together with funding from the Irish and British Governments this will make a substantial fund available to support valuable projects. <\/p>  <p>  The EU has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ireland during the Brexit process. The package we agreed includes a &euro;5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve, which will help support those Member States and sectors most affected. The Government will now work hard to maximise the benefits available to Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, funding for competitive funds, such as the Horizon Europe research and innovation programme, has been substantially increased.<\/p>  <p>  As I made clear in my interventions at the meeting, the EU is facing the most exceptional challenges as a result of Covid19 and its social and economic impacts. Economic recovery for one Member State, including Ireland, will not be possible, without economic recovery for all. It is therefore essential that the EU works together in solidarity towards that goal. <\/p>  <p>  The outcome of the European Council, is one capable of supporting an EU-wide economic recovery and progress in the climate and digital transformations.

From 1st April 2021 people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment will need to apply for a jobseeker payment.<\/p><p>Those who are not eligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment may apply for Jobseeker's Benefit for the self-employed or the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance.<\/p><p>I have also announced a &euro;112 million expansion in employment services and supports under which 45,500 new places are being made available on schemes and services.\u00a0 This includes a number of supports for those looking to move from Pandemic Unemployment Payment to take up

Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.\u00a0<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy regarding the average waiting times\u00a0for appeals in respect of schemes operated by the Department is contained in the table below.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.\u00a0 In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.\u00a0 Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.\u00a0 It is expected that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.\u00a0 As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes generally improved between 2012 and 2019 from\u00a039.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2012 to 26.9 weeks in 2019, and from 27.8 weeks for a summary decision in 2012 to 22.1 weeks in 2019.\u00a0<\/p><p>Processing performance has in the past number of years been affected by a relatively large number of retirements in the Appeals Office - although these staff have been replaced it takes time for a new Appeals Officer to reach full productivity.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the latest data for the period January to June\u00a02020 shows a further improvement of 25.6 weeks\u00a0for an oral hearing and 17.6 weeks for a summary decision. <\/p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.\u00a0\u00a0If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 1

However, these amounts were overtaken by the European Council agreement of 21 July 2020. <\/p><p>We will need to see the European Commission&rsquo;s official allocation for Member States, but at this point Ireland&rsquo;s estimated grant allocation amounts to &euro;1.278 billion made up of:<\/p><p>- &euro;177 million EAFRD allocation<\/p><p>- &euro;204 million React EU <\/p><p>- &euro;44 million Just Transition Fund<\/p><p>- &euro;853 million Recovery and Resilience Facility (This is only 70% of the total amount available under this facility, with potential additional grant allocation from the remaining 30% of the facility to be allocated in 2023 this could potentially be in the region of an additional &euro;300 million).\u00a0<\/p><p>In terms of loans under the NGEU, we estimate that Ireland could potentially avail of approximately &euro;1.4 billion.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the EU Budget are projected to increase considerably over the coming period in all scenarios as a result of economic growth in recent years.<b><\/b>Irish contributions to the EU budget are expected to rise over the coming MFF period from approximately &euro;3 billion in 2021, to over &euro;4 billion in 2027, an average of &euro;3.5 billion.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Exact contributions to the repayment of NGEU borrowing are yet to be determined (and will depend on whether new Own Resources are agreed) but are expected to be significant. At this time of crisis the Covid recovery funds are needed now, but will be paid back over 30+ years<\/p><p>It is important to remember that Ireland has benefitted greatly from EU membership in economic (single market access), social, environmental, and financial terms (net &euro;40+ billion receipts).

This transitional phase provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to a maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees. The operational phase of the scheme was introduced from 4 May 2020 and included increased subsidy rates of 85% as well as a tapering mechanism that ensures the subsidy payment plus any additional payment by the employer does not exceed the employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;normal&rsquo; average weekly wage. The amount of subsidy due to eligible employees is based on their &lsquo;average net weekly pay&rsquo; (ARNWP), which is calculated using the pay and tax details as reported to Revenue in the employer&rsquo;s payroll submission for each pay date in January and February 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the person in question had two active employments in January and February 2020. One of these employments was ceased on 30 April 2020 and that employer did not avail of the TWSS on behalf of the person. However, in order to calculate the amount of wage subsidy payable to the person, the earnings from both active employments were combined and each employer was provided with details of the Maximum Weekly Wage Subsidy payable and the Maximum Weekly Employer Pay before tapering would apply. <\/p>  <p>  The person&rsquo;s current employer has received TWSS payments on her behalf since 15 April 2020. During the transitional phase of the scheme, i.e. for pay dates between 15 April and 3 May 2020, the employer received a subsidy of &euro;410 per week. In the operational phase of the scheme, i.e. for pay dates from 4 May 2020 onwards, the maximum wage subsidy payable is &euro;247.71. The employer may also pay an additional gross (top-up) payment such that the gross pay plus the temporary wage subsidy for the person does not exceed &euro;299.88 per week. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that for pay dates from 13 May 2020 to 24 June 2020 the employer paid &euro;104.34 per fortnight (&euro;52.17 per week), which is the maximum top-up amount payable under the scheme before tapering of the wage subsidy would apply.\u00a0 The additional fortnightly gross amount paid on 8 July 2020 was reduced by the employer to &euro;52.17. It was reduced further by the employer on 22 July 2020 to &euro;48.<\/p>  <p>  While employers are expected to make best efforts to maintain employees&rsquo; net income as close as possible to their &lsquo;normal&rsquo; wage, there is no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional gross (top-up) payment in order to be eligible for the scheme.

In this context, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Central Bank has also advised that it continues to monitor this situation and the impact of COVID-19 very closely to ensure that lenders are continuing to take a consumer-focused approach and are acting in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times.\u00a0 The BPFI has published a Covid-19 support information document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19.

In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.<\/p><p>Regarding the regulations governing mortgage credit, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, require lenders to\u00a0make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.\u00a0 The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.\u00a0 The Regulations further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.\u00a0 In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.\u00a0 Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.\u00a0 <\/p><p>However, if a consumer if not satisfied with the way a regulated entity is dealing with\u00a0his\/her mortgage application or drawdown then, under the provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code, s\/he can make a\u00a0complaint to the lender.\u00a0\u00a0If the consumer is still\u00a0unhappy with the position following the outcome of the internal complaints process, then s\/he\u00a0can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).\u00a0 Clear information on how to make a complaint to the FSPO may be found at this link:<\/p><p>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900088#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equality Proofing of Budgets","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900088#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[19448\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900088#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way in which the commitment to gender and equality proofing will be reflected in the October financial strategy and budget 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[19449\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900088#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way in which the public sector equality and human rights duty will be reflected in the October financial strategy and budget 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s belief in the importance of gender and equality proofing remains an integral part of our overall commitments in dealing with the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.

A pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. To further guide the roll-out of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland.

The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. This ongoing process is further guided by the work of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group. <\/p><p>As outlined in the &lsquo;Programme for Government - Our Shared Future&rsquo;, the government has committed to developing a set of wellbeing indicators to give a more well-rounded, holistic view of how our society is faring.  Initially focusing on housing, education and health, a set of indicators will be developed to create a broader context for policy-making, to include a balanced scorecard for each area of public policy, focused on outcomes and the impact that those policies have on individuals and communities. The overriding focus is to improve the wellbeing of the Irish people and society. <\/p><p>The development of this work will be informed by the experience of other jurisdictions which have developed similar measures in recent years. Through the Department of the Taoiseach, a group of experts will be convened from the public service, academia, NGOs, and the private sector to guide this work.  Once developed, Government will ensure that it is utilised in a systematic way across government policy-making at local and national levels, in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress. This will be an important complement to existing economic measurement tools that are in place to support well-being and outcomes-based approaches to policy making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900088#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900088#WRF01000"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[19460\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900088#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of PAYE taxpayers issued with a tax refund in each of the past five years; the value of refunds in each year; the measures he is taking to ensure that taxpayers avail of tax reliefs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>Revenue has advised me that the number of PAYE taxpayers who received tax refunds in the last five years is set out in the table below.

The scientific advice provided to my Department at the time and following the issuing of annual licences indicated that the virus was highly contagious and easily spread. Moreover, the Department was advised that catching of hares in nets and keeping them in transportation boxes and confined areas like coursing hare parks could all be considered to increase the risk of disease spread.   <\/p>  <p>  Given my Department&rsquo;s responsibility in relation to the conservation status of the Irish hare, it was decided to suspend the licences issued by my Department to the Irish Coursing Club on 9 August 2019 - until a clearer understanding of the extent, spread and implications of the RHD2 virus emerged.  <\/p>  <p>  A revised more restrictive license was subsequently issued to the Irish Coursing Club in October 2019 effective to the end of February this year.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the granting of revised and more restrictive coursing licences, field studies were undertaken at four coursing clubs, which involved veterinary and virology expertise and input.  These studies were carried out to supplement existing knowledge of the prevalence and nature of RHD2 and were undertaken with co-operation between the NPWS, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and the Irish Coursing Club.    <\/p>  <p>  The field studies involved the microchipping and swabbing of all captured hares and the testing of swabs in DAFM laboratories for RHD2. All the hares from these four field studies which were tested for the RHD2 virus were negative.<\/p>  <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department\u00a0is currently working with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine\u00a0on a national survey of RHD2 in rabbits. This\u00a0involves sampling rabbits from hunting bags at different locations in every county of Ireland. All animals will be tested for RHD2 virus (which will demonstrate the presence of the disease) and RHD2 antibodies (to confirm previous exposure\u00a0to the virus and subsequent recovery). Work on the survey has commenced and is ongoing.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The results of this survey will provide a snapshot of the prevalence of RHD2 nationally and will hopefully highlight any geographical patterns that may be present. The results will also indicate if the prevalence of animals with detectable antibodies provides evidence\u00a0that &lsquo;herd immunity&rsquo; to the disease is developing among the rabbit population.\u00a0It is hoped that an improved knowledge of the disease in rabbits will enhance our understanding of the risks that this disease poses to Irish hares.<\/p>  <p>  Testing for the virus itself can only be conducted in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine\u00a0laboratories in Backweston and I understand that this will take some time\u00a0as those facilities are\u00a0assisting in the Covid-19 testing programme.

To achieve that, we will develop a Cost Rental model for delivery of housing that creates affordability for tenants and a sustainable model for construction and management of homes. Cost Rental is housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. Cost Rental is not intended to overlap with or replace traditional social housing for low-income households.<\/p><p>In 2019 an inter-departmental multi-agency Cost Rental Working Group was convened in order to assess methods for the consistent and sustainable delivery of Cost Rental at scale. The Group brings together representatives of relevant Government Departments, State agencies, and local government. The Group is evaluating potential funding models and operational matters such as tenant eligibility. This work will be assisted by a recently initiated research consultancy sponsored by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on behalf of my Department. The EIB has extensive experience in supporting the delivery of affordable housing across Europe and the Report is scheduled for completion in December.<\/p><p>A number of initial projects are already being progressed. Ireland's first Cost Rental development is currently under construction at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown. The project is being undertaken by the Tuath and Respond Approved Housing Bodies, with the assistance of DLR County Council. A second pilot project sponsored by my Department is under development for a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate). The project is being led by Dublin City Council, which owns the site, and is currently at the design stage.

External validation was a new feedback\/ review process, introduced by the &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo; policy document in 2013. In April 2016, the NDFEM Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Fire Services in Ireland - Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;. The Report is available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>This first EVG report was a welcome benchmark of local authority provision of fire services in Ireland, and reviewed a number of themes. For the first time, it reported on the matching of provision of fire services with assessed fire risk. It reviewed fire safety work and undertook an assessment of the impact of national guidance on safety, health and welfare of staff in fire services. The Report concluded that the public are served well by the locally authority provided fire service arrangements and can retain confidence in the integrity and professionalism of those with responsibility for managing and delivering fire safety and fire services in Ireland. <\/p><p>In May 2019, the Management Board of NDFEM authorised a proposal for a second round of external validation, or EVG II. Stakeholder engagement was undertaken in preparation for a thematic review process, which was scheduled to commence in Q1 2020. However, due to Covid-19, the Board made a decision to postpone this process. <\/p><p>As an alternative, the Board mandated staff in the NDFEM to undertake a review of the impact of Covid-19 on local authority fire service resilience and response, as well as on fire safety work and to look at fire services roles in supporting Covid-related emergency management. The objective is to capture lessons,  issues arising and good practice which worked during the first phase of Covid-19 response, so that essential services can continue to be maintained if there are further surges. <\/p><p>This review is currently under way by means of &lsquo;virtual visits&rsquo; (i.e. by Webex link) to each of the 27 fire services and three Regional Communications Centres. This &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; process is being undertaken by an NDFEM team, working in association with Chief Fire Officers and their staff and local authority executives. Fourteen of the thirty &lsquo;virtual visits&rsquo; will be complete by 31 July 2020, and the remaining virtual visits are scheduled for completion by the end of September 2020. A composite report on themes related to of the impact of Covid-19 on fire services will be compiled and presented to the NDFEM Management Board in Q4 2020. <\/p><p>The position in relation to EVG II will be kept under review by the NDFEM Management Board following completion of this virtual process and in light of the evolving Covid-19 situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900089#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900089#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[19379\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900089#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a list of the 2,000 void social housing units being targeted in the July stimulus package by local authorities will be provided; if the &euro;30 million allocation is in addition to the capital allocation for social housing agreed in budget 2020; and if not, if it is a reprofiling of existing capital funding from new build to void refurbishment in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>Following engagement at sectoral level with local authorities regarding the nationwide voids programme under the July stimulus the call for detailed proposals will issue imminently to individual local authorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900089#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900089#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[19380\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900089#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the shovel-ready projects being funded under the announced &euro;30 million additional funding for Irish Water as part of the July stimulus package.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the July Jobs Stimulus Package, the additional capital funding is to be provided to Irish Water to will allow for an acceleration of the leakage reduction programme.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs.  This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in successive Budgets the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 204 w.t.e.  Some 199 of these posts are currently filled which represents the highest number of psychologists to be employed within NEPS since the inception of the service in 2000.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed the Deputy may be aware that I was pleased to announce this week the provision of an additional 17 NEPS psychologist posts as part of my Department's package to assist schools in the task of reopening in the coming school year.

These posts will bring guidance provision in schools back to the level last seen before the financial crisis in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  This allocation is provided separately and transparently on each school's staffing schedule.\u00a0 These posts have been ring-fenced so they can only be used for guidance activities and to meet the guidance needs of the school.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of a more favourable staffing schedule.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has committed considerable resources towards the restoration of guidance counselling hours to post-primary schools, to the provision of CPD for guidance counsellors and to the provision of a national guidance counselling supervision service for post-primary guidance counsellors.<\/p>  <p>  The wellbeing and mental health of our school communities is a fundamental element of the Department&rsquo;s overall plan to ensure a successful return to school as we continue to manage the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 It is crucial that we support the wellbeing of our students and school management and staff in order to support successful re-engagement with teaching and learning.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Guidance will issue to schools on logistical, curricular arrangements and wellbeing supports to be put in place to facilitate the phased re-opening of schools.  All decisions taken in relation to re-opening schools are based on public health advice. <\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities.  The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities on the return to school requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.\u00a0 This requires a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.\u00a0 This response will be aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.\u00a0 My Department will work in partnership with the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that the wellbeing needs of all members of the school community are met.<\/p>  <p>  Schools can utilise their existing school structures, such as the Student Support Team and internal referral pathways, to identify students who remain more vulnerable and then seek to provide these students with additional support, internally or externally by referral on to the HSE or other appropriate support services. <\/p>  <p>  There may be additional challenges for some students, especially for younger students entering post-primary for the first time and for those entering sixth year. \u00a0When planning for both universal and more targeted support, schools may consider particular groups, such as incoming first and sixth year students as groups who require specific interventions to successfully manage these transitions or cope with the return to school.  By careful deployment of school resources, including guidance counselling, these students can be effectively supported as part of the overall resumption of schooling plans.  The Department has published a number of documents regarding how to support student wellbeing. <\/p>  <p>  The guidance counsellor is not expected to be able to provide individual support to every vulnerable student in their school.  More than ever the Continuum of Support Model should be applied in schools, so students most in need of additional targeted support are identified and resources, such as guidance counselling, are directed and distributed appropriately.  This should be done in consultation with school management and the Student Support Team.<\/p>  <p>  Other supports will be provided to Guidance Counsellors in schools including a series of on-line Continuing Professional Development webinars from the National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE)\u00a0covering topics identified by Guidance Counsellors\u00a0such as: adjusting the Guidance Plan, further skills training for online guidance counselling, Junior Cycle Guidance lesson planning, decision making, wellbeing issues and in particular how guidance counsellors can manage their own self-care.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900091#WRJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Curaclam Scoile","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900091#WRJ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[19387\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900091#WRJ04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"An bhfuil cinneadh d&eacute;anta ag an Aire Oideachais maidir le marcanna b&oacute;nais a thabhairt le haghaidh ch&uacute;rsa Gaeilge nua na hArdteiste","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an Chomhairle N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Curaclaim agus Meas&uacute;nachta (NCCA) ag forbairt sonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; &aacute;bhair nua faoi l&aacute;thair maidir leis an Ardteistim&eacute;ireacht.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs.  This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.\u00a0 This\u00a0reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in successive Budgets the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 204 w.t.e.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.\u00a0 This\u00a0reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-tome equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in successive Budgets the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 204 w.t.e. Some 199 of these posts are currently filled which represents the highest number of psychologists to be employed within NEPS since the inception of the service in 2000.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed the Deputy\u00a0may be aware that I was pleased to announce this week the provision of an additional 17 NEPS psychologist posts as part of my Department's\u00a0package to assist schools in the task of reopening in the coming school year.\u00a0\u00a0The filling of these and the\u00a0remaining posts referred to above\u00a0is being actively pursued by my Department in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service. My Department is and remains committed to the maintenance of a robust and effective educational psychological service.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900092#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900092#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[19482\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900092#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the funding that will be allocated to schools in north-central areas of County Cork to provide the necessary equipment and resources to reopen in September 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1453","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>On Monday, the 27<sup>th<\/sup>July, my Department published the report to Government &ldquo;Reopening Our Schools, The Roadmap for the Full Return to School&rdquo;. <\/p><p>This Roadmap set outs how schools will reopen for all students from the end of August and what the operation of our schools will look like and be sustainable in a COVID-19 context.\u00a0 It has been developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), the Roadmap for Society and Business, and follows comprehensive and intensive engagement with education stakeholders including the school management bodies and staff representatives.<\/p><p>My Department is providing capital and current funding of an additional &euro;377 million to support the safe and sustainable reopening of schools under the Roadmap.<\/p><p>There will be an additional &euro;52 million for schools to put in place enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools.

All decisions taken in relation to re-opening schools are based on public health advice. <\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities on the return to school requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.\u00a0 This requires a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.\u00a0 This response will be aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.\u00a0 My Department will work in partnership with the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that the wellbeing needs of all members of the school community are met.<\/p>  <p>  Schools can utilise their existing school structures, such as the Student Support Team and internal referral pathways, to identify students who remain more vulnerable and then seek to provide these students with additional support, internally or externally by referral on to the HSE or other appropriate support services. <\/p>  <p>  There may be additional challenges for some students, especially for younger students entering post-primary for the first time and for those entering sixth year. \u00a0When planning for both universal and more targeted support, schools may consider particular groups, such as incoming first and sixth year students as groups who require specific interventions to successfully manage these transitions or cope with the return to school. By careful deployment of school resources, including guidance counselling, these students can be effectively supported as part of the overall resumption of schooling plans. The Department has published a number of documents regarding how to support student wellbeing. <\/p>  <p>  The guidance counsellor is not expected to be able to provide individual support to every vulnerable student in their school. More than ever the Continuum of Support Model should be applied in schools, so students most in need of additional targeted support are identified and resources, such as guidance counselling, are directed and distributed appropriately.

My officials have been assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors as the economy improves over the period ahead.  Due to COVID social distancing requirements it was not possible initiate the typical face to face multi-agency response including information sessions in physical venues for the employees of Debenhams who were facing redundancy.  However, in view of the large number of employees and their dispersal across the country, my Department organised a bespoke on-line information session in May 2020 with input from other agencies.  Feedback from employees and their unions has been very positive.<\/p>  <p>  As the company is in liquidation, my Department can provide a safety net for employees and payment of statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements to employees can be made from the Social Insurance Fund.  Officials in the Redundancy &amp;amp; Insolvency section have engaged with the liquidators of Debenhams to ensure that all claims in respect of employees will be dealt with expeditiously.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure you that the Government has committed in the Programme for Government to review whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies effectively protect the rights of workers.<\/p>  <p>  The existing suite of employment rights legislation provides industrial relations and employment rights supports for employees who have concerns or complaints regarding their employment rights.  The WRC is the organisation which is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  The Customer Service section of the WRC, who operate a telephone helpline at 1890 808090 can provide further information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, and how to obtain redress where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the proposal to withdraw the employers&rsquo; right to make employees redundant for a certain period, I fully understand that the proposal is motivated to protect employee rights.  However, this proposal could have far reaching and significant unintended consequences, including interfering with individual contracts of employment and the potential for significant constitutional law issues.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it cannot be said that all employees will want the redundancy provision removed as is suggested.  Employees may have significant service with an employer and be aware that if the business is struggling, redundancy and seeking new employment opportunities may be the better option for them.  <\/p>  <p>  The proposal could also create a risk to an employee's right to a redundancy payment.  The State does not have the power to stop a business closing or to prevent liquidations once the provisions of company law are complied with.  If the right of the employer to make an employee redundant is taken away this could jeopardise an employee&rsquo;s right to compensation by way of a redundancy payment while the liquidation of that company is underway.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to bear in mind why redundancy provisions are used.  If a business is in trading and in financial difficulties very often one of the mechanisms used to save that business (which in turn saves some jobs) is redundancy.  An employer may downsize their business and reduce their workforce by way of redundancies in order to continue to be viable.  If the right of the employer to make employees redundant is removed it could result in more permanent job losses. <\/p>  <p>  Employers have to make decisions on the ongoing viability of their firms in real time and having regard to real circumstances &ndash; particularly in circumstances where revenues have collapsed for many firms.  Under company law provisions directors of firms have very serious and personal responsibilities to ensure that they can continue to trade and not trade whilst insolvent.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, and this is important for employees who may be in a position to negotiate a redundancy package with the many genuine employers in our economy - if a company is restricted from making employees redundant and has to retain them on payroll, the assets of that company will dissipate and mean that any negotiated redundancy package has less chance of success.<\/p>  <p>  By putting in place a wide range of business supports including the temporary wage subsidy scheme which helps affected companies keep paying their employees, maintain the employment relationship and keep businesses viable, the Government has already put in place significant measures which are helping to prevent redundancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900093#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":544,"content":"<p>Question No. 209 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Support Services","counter":545,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900093#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":546,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[18958\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900093#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the way in which she plans to prioritise and protect supports for lone parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":547,"content":"<p>My Department moved swiftly to put in place enhanced and new supports for individuals and families during the public health emergency.

Benefits are intended to replace lost income where a person is, for some reason, not able to engage with the labour force.\u00a0 Where there is no recent history of contributions being paid or credited then there is no entitlement to most benefits.<\/p>  <p>  Invalidity pension is a substantial and long-term payment for persons who are permanently incapable of work and who satisfy the social insurance conditions. A total of 260 weeks contributions paid and 48 weeks contributions paid or credited in the last complete tax year before the relevant date or in the tax year before the last complete tax year are required to satisfy the PRSI conditions for Invalidity Pension. The reckonable contribution classes are A, E, H and S. <\/p>  <p>  A person on reduced working hours may continue to access social insurance. Currently, there is no set number of hours per week that must be worked to access social insurance. Until 1991 the threshold for access to social insurance was based on hours worked &ndash; 18 hours. From April 1991 onwards, a person was insurable at the Class A rate of PRSI if their income equaled or exceeded &pound;25 per week. \u00a0This threshold was increased to &pound;30 per week from April 1994 and upon conversion to Euro the &pound;30 threshold became &euro;38.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, based on the current national minimum wage hourly rate of &euro;10.10, an employee working under 4 hours per week gains access to the full range of social insurance benefits.<\/p>  <p>  A person who is not working may keep up their contribution record in a number of ways. One of these is by credited contributions. A credited contribution is a PRSI contribution awarded to an insured person under certain circumstances, such as proved unemployment. Credited contributions are an integral part of the social insurance system. For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave. The primary purpose of credited contributions is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc. Credits ensure that a person&rsquo;s insurance record is maintained and can be helpful at a later stage to qualify for other social welfare benefits, such as pensions or to increase the rate of pension that may become payable. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Appropriate social insurance contributions paid in another European Union Member-State can count for the purpose of bridging a contribution gap &ndash; provided that one social insurance contribution is made in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Persons who have an insufficient contribution record to qualify for a social insurance benefit may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme. For example persons between the ages of 16 and 66 who are suffering from an illness or disability which is expected to last at least 1 year, may qualify for Disability Allowance. Disability Allowance recipients must be habitually resident in the State. <\/p>  <p>  Given that people can count\u00a0contributions\u00a0in a range of ways as outlined above, and that\u00a0credited contributions are awarded in a wide range of circumstances, I\u00a0do not have plans to change the\u00a0contribution conditions for Invalidity Pension at this time.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to scheme qualifying criteria would have to be considered in a budgetary context.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900094#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900094#WRM03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900094#WRM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[19249\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900094#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if her attention has been drawn to an article in a newspaper (details supplied); if no public funds provided to an organisation by her Department were used to pay the award of &euro;43,470 as outlined in the article; if an audit will be carried out in order to clarify the issue; if programmes at the organisation will continue to receive funding; if not, if a public tender process will be considered; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>My Department has not provided funding to the organisation referred to by the Deputy for the specific purposes of paying the award mentioned. <\/p>  <p>  In the past,\u00a0my Department has provided funding to the organisation to cover a portion of its operational costs.\u00a0 The most recent funding provided in respect of these costs was for the period August 2018 to July 2019. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also provided funding to the organisation to fund an initiative to support the installation of carbon monoxide alarms in the homes of elderly, isolated and vulnerable people throughout rural Ireland.\u00a0 Funding in respect of this initiative was provided on the basis of the vouched costs of the alarms and a small administration fee for the organisation concerned. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has requested financial reports from the organisation in respect of the periods covered by the funding and is awaiting receipt of these reports.\u00a0 My officials will consider whether any further action is necessary when these financial reports are received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900094#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900094#WRM03500"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[19357\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900094#WRM03600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of freedom of information requests being processed by her Department; the number that have had the deadline for reply extended; the number that are at least one week, two weeks, one month and over one month overdue, respectively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>My Department\u00a0is processing one Freedom of Information request at present.

Supporting services as they reopen, and ensuring that capacity is sufficient to meet demand, is a key priority of my Department. The following points are critical:<\/p>  <p>  - The Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2019 demonstrated that, prior to the disruption caused by COVID-19, the sector was running at near capacity, with some capacity issues emerging in certain areas and for certain groups, including children under 3.<\/p>  <p>  - The expert guidance on the safe reopening of ELC and SAC services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on 29 May.\u00a0The Department believes that\u00a0most services should be able to comply with the public health advice with no or little reduction in capacity.<\/p>  <p>  - Recent IPSOS\/MRBI surveys of parents commissioned by my Department indicate a drop in the number of families likely to seek to access ELC and SAC in the initial weeks of reopening.<\/p>  <p>  - Previously, to address emerging capacity issues for younger children, my Department targeted its capital funding towards maintaining and extending the supply of publicly subsidised places. In 2019, for example, 1,321 new places for children under 3 were created at a cost of &euro;4 million.<\/p>  <p>  - Further, in recognition of the higher cost of delivering ELC to young children due to ratio requirements and to remove any disincentives for providers to offer places for babies and toddlers, the National Childcare Scheme provides a progressive system of subsidies starting with the highest subsidy rates for children under 1 with graded rates for those aged from one year and upwards.<\/p>  <p>  - Childminders form a key part of service provision for young children. To support the registration of more childminders with Tusla, so as to allow them access subsidies under the NCS, my Department has recruited a National Childminding Coordinator along with a team of Development Officers around the country.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear, however, that further capacity is required and that is why I am continuing my intensive efforts in this area.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of services reopening and operating in a COVID-19 environment, the funding package I announced on 25 July will enable providers to continue to operate with lower capacity and extra operating costs. This funding package for the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) sector from 24 August to end 2020 includes:<\/p>  <p>  - Continuation of all DCYA ELC and SAC subsidy schemes (NCS, CCSP, TEC) and resumption of the ECCE Programme at existing capitation and subsidy rates, including ECCE Higher Capitation;<\/p>  <p>  - Access to the Revenue-operated EWSS. This will cover an average of 38% of the costs of individual services.<\/p>  <p>  - A sustainability fund will be accessible to providers (not-for-profit and for-profit) who can demonstrate that the other measures are not sufficient by themselves to enable viable operation of their business.<\/p>  <p>  The suite of resources provided to support reopening, which includes training supports, is continually updated. Indeed, the HPSC will host a webinar on Infection Control Guidance for Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare Settings this coming Friday.<\/p>  <p>  In the more medium term, preparations are underway to develop a strategic capital investment plan to ensure effective allocation of &euro;250 million that has been earmarked for ELC and SAC in Project 2040. My Department is also finalising an Action Plan for Childminding that will set out all the steps we will take to improve access to high quality and subsidised childminding services in the coming years for all children.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to advance a range of measures to improve access to childcare places, particularly for younger children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900095#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900095#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[19397\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900095#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities are not taking children under the age of one due to Covid-19, which has resulted in parents being required to take unpaid leave from work to take care of their children; if support will be given to parents in such circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>Expert guidance on the safe reopening of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on Friday, 29 May. \u00a0The guidance recommends use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model which\u00a0restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children.

These supports have aimed to maintain the sustainability of the sector and to maintain the affordability of services for parents.<\/p>  <p>  Following the closure of ELC and SAC services on 12 March 2020, my Department continued to make ELC and SAC programme payments on an ex-gratia basis.\u00a0This temporary arrangement was an immediate response to the closures for the purpose of the sustainability of the sector while more appropriate policy responses were being considered. No special conditions were attached to these payments, and arrangements for the payment of parental fees are a matter between parents and providers. There is therefore no obligation for services to refund parental fees for the two weeks following 17 March. However, subsequent schemes to support the ELC and SAC sector during this period did introduce certain fee controls to maintain affordability for parents.<\/p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS)\u00a0was introduced on\u00a06 April. This supplemented the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme by providing a top up for staff wages and a contribution to ongoing overhead costs.\u00a0One of the conditions of payment under the TWSCS is that services would not charge parents fees for the period of the TWSCS. That period was from 6 April to 28 June.<\/p>  <p>  From 29 June, as services began to reopen,\u00a0my Department provided a major funding package to facilitate the reopening of\u00a0ELC and\u00a0SAC services. This funding package provided a Reopening Support Payment (RSP) to allow providers to operate with potentially less parental income and to assist in meeting the possible costs associated with complying with public health requirements.\u00a0It is a condition of the\u00a0Reopening Support Payment that participating services must apply the Registered Fees List that was in place on 12 March 2020, without amendments, for the duration of the scheme, until 23 August.\u00a0Where possible, services are also\u00a0requested to avoid charging fees, deposits or other measures to hold places.<\/p>  <p>  On 25 July I announced a package of measures to support the ELC and SAC sector as remaining services reopen in late August and early September.

The Unit has also been collecting and checking Public Health Passenger Locator Forms at Dublin Airport, and undertaking follow-up phone calls on arrivals into Dublin Airport and all other ports of entry nationwide on behalf of the health authorities, since 28 April 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The mandatory regime, as set out in the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19 Passenger Locator Form) Regulations 2020, for completion of Public Health Passenger Locator Forms by all arriving passengers into the State (excluding the exempt categories) came into effect on Thursday 28 May 2020. Any passenger refusing to complete the mandatory form at Dublin Airport is referred to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). To date, only 3 passengers at Dublin Airport have been referred to GNIB for refusing to complete a form.<\/p>  <p>  From 28 April 2020 to 30\u00a0June 2020, almost 100% of passenger arrivals into both Dublin Airport and all other ports of entry nationwide who required telephone follow-up were contacted by BMU staff. However, since 1 July 2020, due to a rise in passenger numbers and the requirement to prioritise core immigration work at Dublin Airport, the BMU\u00a0is not operationally positioned to continue follow-up calls at the rate conducted previously and now make a sample of follow-up calls for all ports of entry nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  The BMU\u00a0has new working arrangements in place in line with Public Health advice on managing the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the introduction of the Passenger Locator Form, every member of the Unit has been involved in their collection and checking for completeness.<\/p>  <p>  The follow-up calls are made between the hours of 10am and 7pm. Up to 30 June 2020, dedicated teams were in place to undertake this work. A dedicated team of 8 staff has capacity to progress 960 calls in total covering Dublin Airport and other ports nationwide during the hours outlined.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2020, given the increase in passenger numbers, it is no longer operationally feasible for the BMU to assign dedicated teams to the follow-up work. Therefore, all staff working between the hours of 10am and 7pm undertake the Passenger Locator Form follow-up work in addition to their operational immigration duties.

This arises from the disease itself, as well as from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.<\/p>  <p>  The Government Action Plan in response to Covid-19, published on 16 March 2020, acknowledges the importance of people maintaining their wellbeing and resilience to push through this unprecedented outbreak. The Action Plan aims to reduce the risk of people becoming unwell and for those with a mild mental health issue, access to counselling and other interventions can provide much better positive outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0A psycho-social planning Group (HSE, DoH, NGO sector) has been established to plan for additional current and\/or anticipated needs as post COVID. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the WHO considerations, and the existing HSE guidelines, the Department of Health and HSE proposes a continuum of supports and a &lsquo;stepped care&rsquo; approach to support the mental health and wellbeing needs of the population during and following the COVID 19 outbreak. This includes establishing strategies to ensure youth mental health is protected as schools prepare to re-open and exam results are disseminated. As part of the mental health response to COVID 19, a 4 step health approach is preferred:<\/p>  <p>  1. A whole-population approach to raise awareness and promote mental health and wellbeing that will include additional supports for Junior and Leaving Certificate students. The Department of Health (led by Healthy Ireland team) and the HSE, in collaboration with key cross-Government and cross-sectoral partners, has developed a new mental wellbeing campaign.<\/p>  <p>  2. Provision of life skills supports through Jigsaw online, youthreach and Foroige etc.<\/p>  <p>  3. Provision of additional online supports such as counselling online through MyMind\/Turn2Me etc.<\/p>  <p>  4. Provision of online psychiatry supports for individuals with new\/existing complex mental health needs (referral through primary care GP or Jigsaw).<\/p>  <p>  The support services available for young people and families are listed on www.yourmentalhealth.ie and Gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s June Activity Performance Report indicates that residential and community mental health service activity has returned to close to pre-Covid levels.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE, overseen by Dr Colm Henry (Chief Clinical Officer) and Dean Sullivan (Deputy Director General), is considering how to reintroduce\/recommence services. Public health advice will guide the return to more comprehensive provision. Through its Business Continuity Plan, HSE Mental Health is considering ways to safely improve services in acute units, community residential settings and community teams, including telehealth technologies. Further engagement with NGO partners will maximise delivery through SLAs. <\/p>  <p>  To plan for the ongoing and increasing need for mental health services, and the demand for more holistic person-centred responses across the whole community, the national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, was published on 17th June 2020. The policy sets out a 10-year plan, including education, prevention and early intervention and additional access routes to treatment. The policy takes a lifecycle approach, and consequently includes recommendations for CAMHS services and positive mental health promotion for young people. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The health service already has a range of proactive responses for any rise in service need. The Department and HSE continue to plan for any need surge as it arises and as services return to normal provision and capacity, subject to public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health, with the HSE, will continue to monitor and maximise provision of CAMHS by the 71 CAMHS teams and 4 CAMHS inpatient units nationally for the remainder of the year, including HSE Service Plan activity levels. This ongoing performance monitoring will include full consideration of new approaches at national or local level to address waiting lists in an evolving Covid-19 situation.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has adapted provision of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) supports in Covid-19, and clinically urgent cases continue to be prioritised. CAMHS patients continue to access a comprehensive range of mental health supports specifically for Covid-19 issues, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan has a specific priority to continue to develop CAMHS inpatient and community-based services, and their integration with primary care services, as well as Talk Therapy and Child Mental Health Intellectual Disability teams. <\/p>  <p>  The new HSE National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS) complex at Portrane, recently used for Covid-19 purposes, will become operational early next year. This will involve the opening, on a phased basis, of the main forensic hospital, the Intensive Care Rehabilitation Unit and a forensic CAMHs Unit.<\/p>  <p>  CAMHS Connect is a new e-mental health initiative to modernise mental health care nationally. The need for the potential roll-out of such a system nationally, in planning for some time, has been reinforced by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  CAMHS Connect will improve access, reduce waiting times and address some staff recruitment and retention issues. Overall investment for the initial phase, the new Castlerea Mental Health Hub, is in the region of &euro;2.6m.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside the HSE&rsquo;s YourMentalHealth.ie website, several state funded agencies have developed new ways of working during Covid-19. These include online support, additional telephone support lines and online training and peer support. These agencies are working with the HSE to determine future need based on uptake and are working with the HSE psychosocial response team on flexible responses to identified needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900097#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[19339\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900097#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the provisions that have been made in the regulations which require persons to wear face masks for those persons that for certifiable medical reasons are unable to wear facemasks.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department appreciates the concerns around face coverings with regard to those who may not be in a position to wear them for medical reasons.<\/p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) continues to examine all emerging evidence as it arises and has provided advice relating to face coverings on an ongoing basis. NPHET advises the wearing of a non-medical face covering in a number of circumstances including in retail outlets, by people visiting the homes of those who are cocooning, by people who are being visited in their homes by those who are cocooning, by visitors to residential care facilities and in indoor work environments where it is difficult to maintain a two-metre distance. I would again emphasise that the wearing of face coverings is an additional hygiene measure and should not take the place of good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and other personal protective public health measures. Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and with individuals washing their\u00a0hands before putting them on and taking them off. <\/p>  <p>  On Friday 10 July 2020, having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, I signed the Health Act (Covid-19)(Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 244\/2020). The regulations provide that, from 13 July 2020, members of the public (excluding children under the age of 13) shall not, without reasonable excuse, travel by public transport without wearing a face covering. <\/p>  <p>  Reasonable excuse includes where a person:<\/p>  <p>  -  cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress<\/p>  <p>  -  needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating<\/p>  <p>  -  removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person<\/p>  <p>  -  removes the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury<\/p>  <p>  -  removes the face covering to take medication\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Regulations provide that a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo;, defined as an officer, employee or agent of a public transport operator or of the National Transport Authority, who is responsible for the implementation of the Regulations and it is, therefore, a matter for the public transport operators and the National Transport Authority to make arrangements for what they consider necessary to ensure that such &ldquo;relevant persons&rdquo; are satisfied with the information provided by any individual who is using a public transport service. <\/p>  <p>  As I am sure will be appreciated, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings is constantly evolving. The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), while the Government has now also agreed to the mandatory wearing of face coverings in retail outlets, shops and shopping centres. Retail staff will also be obliged to wear a face covering unless there is a partition between them and members of the public or where there is a distance of 2 metres between them and members of the public.\u00a0The development of Regulations is this regard is underway and it is likely that similar &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; provisions will be included. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the latest public health advice on face coverings is available at the following links and is updated on a regular basis:<\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/facecoverings.<\/p>  <p>  www2.hse.ie\/conditions\/coronavirus\/face-masks-disposable-gloves.html.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900097#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","counter":762,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900097#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":763,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[19341\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900097#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when there will be a resumption of day and respite services for those with special needs and the day services provided by a service (details supplied) in County Cork;

It is fully accepted that admission to an age-appropriate facility is in the best interests of the child. This is reflected in the Programme for Government which commits to work to end the admission of children to adult psychiatric units by increasing in-patient beds, as well as examining the model of assigning these beds. <\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires admission to an in-patient unit, a bed in a\u00a0Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) unit is sought in the first instance. A decision to admit to an adult unit is made only if a CAMHS admission is not feasible. Where such admissions take place, HSE Standard Operating Procedures apply. An admission to an adult unit must be advised to the Mental Health Commission and is generally to a separate area in the adult unit with appropriate supervision. <\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of child admissions to adult units are for children in the 16-17 age bracket.\u00a0The HSE advises\u00a0that admission to an adult unit may often be more appropriate for the individual and to avoid any impact on younger children in CAMHS in-patient units. Children admitted to adult units are provided with special supports by the HSE. \u00a0The HSE Service Plan allows for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements take place.\u00a0 Full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, and geographical factors relating to access or visiting. In this context, the HSE continues to closely monitor on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units with a view to minimising this practice. <\/p>  <p>  Progress in this area has been significant since 2008 when there were 247 such admissions to adult units.\u00a0This\u00a0was reduced to\u00a050 HSE admissions\u00a0in 2019, despite a background of increasing demands overall on CAMHS services. \u00a0In 2008, 25% of admissions were\u00a0to CAMHS inpatient beds whereas in 2019 this had increased to\u00a086%. It is important to note that the number of\u00a0admissions\u00a0does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children admitted in any given year, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, there was a total of 358 HSE\u00a0CAMHS admissions, of which\u00a0308 (86%) were to age-appropriate units and\u00a050 (14%) of admissions of children were to Adult Units. Of the 50 admitted to Adult Approved Centres, 47, or 94%, were 16-17 years old, with 48% (24) of these discharged either the same day or within 3 days, and 82% (41) within a week. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of bed days used, 96% of bed days used in 2019\u00a0were in CAMHS\u00a0In-patient Units. Performance generally continues to be in line with\u00a0the HSE Service Plan target figure of 95%, with\u00a0the length of stay\u00a0being kept to a minimum. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE indicates that there were 12 admissions of those under age 18 to adult units for the period from January to end May, 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0recently met with\u00a0the HSE to review\u00a0various issues relating to mental health, including CAMHS.\u00a0Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied\u00a0that where children have at present\u00a0to be placed short-term in adult mental health units, the\u00a0HSE makes\u00a0the necessary arrangements to protect these young people and aid their recovery.\u00a0I will, however, continue to work with the HSE to continue the decrease in admissions to adult units, including maximising the new care options around mental health for young people highlighted in Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900098#WRQ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":820,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[19413\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900098#WRQ03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"what out-of-hours mental health services are available for children and adults in County Wexford; his plans to expand the services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":821,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900098#WRQ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900098#WRQ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[19414\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900098#WRQ04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons waiting for homecare support in County Wexford; the number of hours allocated in each of the past 12 months in County Wexford; the average number of hours granted to each successful applicant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":824,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900098#WRQ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900098#WRQ04400"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[19415\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900098#WRQ04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons awaiting a colonoscopy in Wexford General Hospital; the number who have been waiting up to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 90 and more than 90 days, respectively, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":827,"content":"<p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020.

This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.

The legislation imposes restrictions on the possession, production, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations were updated and additional controls on benzodiazepines and so-called 'z-drug' sedatives\u00a0were introduced, including import and export controls, stricter prescribing and dispensing controls, as well as an offence of possession, thereby assisting Customs and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting public health and local communities. <\/p>  <p>  The amendments to the Regulations also\u00a0afforded practitioners an opportunity to review patients receiving such medications and allow them to make brief interventions with these patients. Brief interventions have been shown to be of value in reducing prescription usage of these potent medicines.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2017 the Medical Council of Ireland and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland launched joint guidance on the Safe Prescribing and Dispensing of Controlled drugs. The aim of this resource was to facilitate safer prescribing and dispensing of controlled drugs. It should be used by all prescribers and pharmacists in the collaborative, safe and effective care of patients. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In further support of the legislative changes, in February 2018, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP)\u00a0published &ldquo;Guidance on appropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines and z-drugs (BZRA) in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia&rdquo;. It contains information on initiation and review of BZRA, highlighting the potential dangers associated with long-term use and provides examples of resource materials which may support prescribers and pharmacists to manage the withdrawal of patients from these medicines.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  More recently, officials in the Department of Health have been working with stakeholders, including prescribers, pharmacists and the HSE, facilitated by the Medical Council, to further examine the issue of the prescribing of benzodiazepines and other controlled drugs and to build on the changes introduced in 2017. This is providing a platform for key stakeholders to work together to develop initiatives, led by the respective stakeholders,\u00a0to better address the difficulties associated with the prescribing of controlled drugs. <\/p>  <p>  This group, via the HSE MMP, has prepared support materials, including posters for GP waiting rooms and community pharmacies, and patient guides to better inform both prescribers and patients of the potential risks associated with the prescribing of controlled drugs. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Health are continuing to engage with and support the work of this group\u00a0as it considers potential solutions to ensure greater visibility and governance around the prescribing and dispensing of controlled drugs in order to ensure the safe, appropriate and efficacious use of these important but potent medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900100#WRS03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Addiction Treatment Services","counter":907,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900100#WRS03900"},{"type":"question","counter":908,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[19509\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072900100#WRS04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding available to prevent gambling addiction; the amount available to treat gambling addiction; and the number of publicly funded treatment places for those specifically suffering from a gambling addiction.
