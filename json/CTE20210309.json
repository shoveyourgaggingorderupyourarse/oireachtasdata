Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask that committee members confirm their locations before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin our public engagement, we considered the minutes of our meetings of 18, 23 and 25 February and 2 March at our private meeting last week.  Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes are agreed in public session.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s webpage.<\/p> <p>  Today we are engaging with officials from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to examine its financial statements for 2019.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from SBCI: Mr. Ian Black, interim CEO, Ms Suzanne Sweeney, head of lending, and Mr. Ray Mangan, head of risk, finance and operations.  I welcome them to the meeting and thank them and their staff for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask that members and witnesses mute themselves when not contributing in order that we will not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode. <\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister, or of the objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask the witnesses to state their names the first time they contribute.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030900002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615282200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, was established in September 2014 to address difficulties that small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, were perceived to be experiencing in accessing funding from Irish credit institutions, due to lingering effects of the 2008 banking crisis.  Since 2017, SBCI has been tasked to provide assistance to SMEs where access to credit is constrained by specific sectoral or economic market failures, including risks arising due to Brexit.  To the best of my recollection, this is the first occasion on which representatives of SBCI have appeared before the committee.<\/p> <p>  SBCI&rsquo;s operations are financed through a combination of State and European funding.  Its borrowings are guaranteed by the Minster for Finance, as provided for under the governing legislation.  The initial business model adopted by SBCI was based on providing wholesale finance to intermediate financial institutions that act as on-lenders to deliver low-cost funding to SMEs and to introduce competition to the market.  The on-lenders include both mainstream banks and non-bank specialist lenders.<\/p> <p>  SBCI now delivers services in three ways.  It continues to offer long-term, low-cost liquidity facilities to intermediate financial institutions that in turn extend finance to SMEs, provides guarantee and risk-sharing facilities to improve the ability of SMEs to access finance and acts as a service provider to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of the credit guarantee schemes.<\/p> <p>  The risk-sharing model is designed to provide partial credit guarantees to lenders in order to facilitate the advancement of credit to SMEs.  SBCI added to its risk-sharing portfolio in June 2019 when it launched the future growth loan scheme.  This scheme is designed to assist SMEs in making long-term investments in their businesses by providing loans over terms of eight to ten years.  This followed the introduction of other risk-sharing schemes such as the Brexit loan scheme in 2018 and the agriculture cash flow support loan scheme in 2017.  Operationally, all potential on-lenders are required to demonstrate to SBCI that they have the necessary financial strength and capability to provide the required level of service to SMEs.  SBCI carries out reviews on a cyclical basis to gain assurance that on-lenders continue to operate within the accepted risk parameters.<\/p> <p>  During the 2019 financial year, SBCI used credit facilities from two international and two national funders to provide funding products to SMEs through six on-lending partners, namely, three bank and three non-bank on-lenders.  At the end of the year, SBCI had lending of more than &euro;555 million in issue to its six on-lenders.  This represented a net reduction of 11.5% in the level of lending over the year when compared with end 2018 lending of &euro;627 million.  SBCI&rsquo;s operating expenses in the year amounted to &euro;9.4 million.  This included &euro;2.7 million in respect of salaries paid to SBCI staff.  Members may wish to note that the staff are employees of the National Treasury Management Agency seconded to the SBCI.  The agency also provides administration supports to SBCI, including premises, HR functions, procurement and financial management services.  Costs incurred by the National Treasury Management Agency are recovered from SBCI.  Salary costs incurred by SBCI in 2019 include performance-related payments of &euro;103,000 that were awarded to seven SBCI staff members in respect of 2019.  The then CEO of SBCI received performance-related pay of &euro;25,000 for that year.<\/p><p>Income earned by SBCI in 2019 amounted to &euro;9.3 million.  This included net interest\u00a0of just under &euro;5 million and operating expenses recovered from Departments that fund SBCI's various schemes.\u00a0 For 2019, SBCI incurred a loss of nearly &euro;500,000.  I issued an unqualified\u00a0audit opinion on the 2019 financial statements.\u00a0<\/p><p> Finally, during 2019, SBCI commissioned an external consultancy firm to perform a\u00a0strategic review of its operations in the context of the State's range of supports for\u00a0SMEs.  The review noted that the original purpose of SBCI had abated because the\u00a0SME market no longer faced the same challenges of credit availability as was the case\u00a0when SBCI was established.  Nevertheless, the review found that there remained\u00a0challenges to be addressed, including ensuring access for SMEs to appropriate credit\u00a0products promoting competitive credit terms and supporting specific SME sectors.\u00a0 The report went on to make a number of recommendations to be considered as part\u00a0of SBCI's future strategy, including undertaking more detailed appraisal of the specific\u00a0market challenges within the SME credit sector in order to assess SBCI's methods of\u00a0intervention.  The subsequent market disruption brought about as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic will need to be considered as part of such appraisals.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p> The chief executive officer of SBCI will be able to provide an update on the progress\u00a0achieved in regard to the recommendations made in the external review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030900002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615282200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am joined by Ms Suzanne Sweeney, head of\u00a0lending, and Ray Mangan, head of risk, finance and operations.\u00a0 SBCI is Ireland's promotional financial institution for SMEs and has been in business for\u00a0a little over six years.  In that time, we have provided more than &euro;2.3 billion in low-cost, flexible\u00a0funding and more than 35,000 individual facilities to Irish SMEs and farmers.  More than &euro;1.9 billion of\u00a0SBCI-supported facilities have been drawn down by SMEs to date.  We serve SMEs of all sizes and our individual loan facilities have ranged in size from &euro;5,000 to &euro;4 million.  The launch of the Government's Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme has provided an additional &euro;2 billion in\u00a0guarantee capacity to support the SME finance market.  To date, the credit guarantee scheme has provided more than 4,000 SMEs with funding of &euro;264 million.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I would like to ask members of the committee who are aware of\u00a0any constituent who owns or works for an SME and is looking for funding, to please refer them\u00a0to us.  We will point them in the right direction as to the facilities that are most appropriate\u00a0for them and where they can access those facilities through our on-lending partners.  While SME awareness of the supports we offer through our lending partners is relatively high, we\u00a0would welcome members' help in bringing our services to the attention of their constituents\u00a0 wherever possible.<\/p> <p>  To date, we have teamed up with 33 on-lenders, comprising the five retail banks operating in\u00a0Ireland, nine non-bank institutions and 19 credit unions.  Those credit unions are located\u00a0throughout the country.\u00a0 In our early days, we sourced low-cost funding which we lent to partners to allow them to lend to their SME customers at a discount on the prevailing market rate.  This gave SMEs\u00a0access to lower-cost funding that provided both cost savings and cash flow benefits to\u00a0them.\u00a0 In recent years, our role has evolved to reflect changing market conditions.  We began\u00a0offering risk-sharing schemes through partner on-lenders and we now support SME\u00a0borrowers through five separate risk-sharing schemes tailored to meet specific challenges\u00a0facing SMEs.  Risk sharing allows lending partners to provide loans without taking all of the\u00a0credit risk, which facilitates easier access for SMEs to these loans through more attractive\u00a0security requirements, lending criteria or loan pricing.<\/p> <p>  SBCI's countercyclical model has\u00a0allowed it to respond quickly to emerging challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic and\u00a0Brexit.  The value of SBCI as a ready-made conduit for State support was clearly\u00a0evidenced by the delivery of the Covid-19 working capital scheme and the Covid-19 credit\u00a0guarantee scheme as timely responses to the crisis.\u00a0 The provision of risk-sharing schemes was made possible by SBCI acting as Ireland's\u00a0conduit for Government funding and European SME support schemes, initiated by\u00a0institutions including the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund.  These\u00a0schemes aim to make it easier for SMEs to access finance for working capital and\u00a0investment purposes.\u00a0 We also operate the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, launched last year, on behalf of the\u00a0Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We have operated a similar credit guarantee\u00a0scheme to enhance SME access to finance since 2016.<\/p> <p>  I would like to brief the committee on the scheduled strategic review undertaken by\u00a0 SBCI, which concluded last year and resulted in the development of a new strategy for\u00a0the period 2020 to 2025.\u00a0\u00a0This review was informed by an external analysis undertaken by EY and was conducted in accordance with the requirement in the legislation establishing SBCI for a periodic\u00a0review to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.\u00a0\u00a0The key elements of SBCI's strategy for the period 2020 to 2025 include our plans to launch a range of new SME funding options during the period, to be Ireland's conduit for major European SME funding programmes, to explore the potential for supporting new SME energy retrofit schemes, and to explore the potential for supporting new loans to higher-risk, higher-growth\u00a0SMEs, together with new forms of finance such as mezzanine and junior debt.<\/p> <p>  I would like to conclude my opening remarks by acknowledging the contribution to SBCI's development over the past six years of Nick Ashmore, who served as CEO from its inception until last month.  I was appointed interim CEO by the SBCI board\u00a0pending the recruitment of a permanent CEO.  I will step down when that appointment is\u00a0made and return to my role as chief financial and operating officer at the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  As members are aware, the NTMA provides staffing and infrastructure supports for SBCI.  While SBCI is a separate entity with its own board, all SBCI staff are employees of the NTMA.\u00a0 I hope that my opening remarks and the slide presentation we circulated separately have\u00a0given the committee a better understanding of the work of SBCI.  Ms Sweeney, Mr. Mangan and I will\u00a0do our best to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Black"},{"type":"speech","time":1615282200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Black for his statement.

In my analysis, it has been seen as the key bank to go to for small to medium-sized food companies seeking to access lending for productive purposes.  I want to get a sense from Mr. Black as to, first, whether there is now a high level of exposure for that sector, given the decision of Ulster Bank to pull out of the market, and, second, whether SBCI is aware of this and if it is something that is on its agenda.  If we take the two challenges of Covid and Brexit, as well as the importance of the food sector and the recognition of Ulster Bank as being a go-to bank for small to medium-sized food companies that are export driven, is there a consciousness within SBCI of the need to plug that gap in lending?  Is this a conversation that is taking place at present?  I would like to get that perspective from Mr. Black, if I may.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030900002#B00500","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615282200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>We very much regret the phased departure of Ulster Bank from Ireland.

As reported in the media, we are aware of Ulster Bank's discussions and the memorandum of understanding, MOU, signed with AIB, and discussions with Permanent TSB in terms of its commercial and micro-SME loan books.  Ulster Bank will require the consent of the SBCI in advance of any transfer of any and all SBCI-supported products or assets.  I note that Ulster Bank has capacity under the Covid-19 capital loan and credit guarantee schemes and this will be made available to SME's.  It will be there in the short term and will continue to provide those services to SMEs, including those in the food sector.  Obviously, the situation will become clearer over the next period in terms of its discussions with AIB and Permanent TSB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021030900002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Black","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615282200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Is my perception right and is my research solid in saying that there is a strong relationship between food companies and Ulster Bank in particular?

I refer, for example, to small, mainly family-run start-ups or, perhaps, high potential start-up companies that are scaling up and exporting.<\/p> <p>  I am seeking comfort from the SBCI on what Mr. Black said about the MOU.  Is that Mr. Black's view, insofar as he can speak for Ulster Bank and insofar as we are still going through a process here?  I do not want to see a chunk of lending potential slipping off the radar and a chunk of a sector that is vital to Ireland's economic interests finding itself in a position where it has no go-to bank for the type of funding the SBCI provides to the on-lenders.

Apologies have been received from Deputies Stanton and Duffy.<\/p> <p>  We will continue our consideration of the general scheme of the Employment Permits (Consolidation and Amendment) Bill 2019, which has been submitted to the committee by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for pre-legislative scrutiny.  At the previous meeting we received a briefing from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  To discuss the matter today, I am pleased to welcome from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, Dr. Kara McGann and Ms Joanne Redmond, and from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, Mr. Liam Berney.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding reference that may be made to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are to give evidence remotely from a location outside the parliamentary precincts.

IBEC was delighted to contribute to the review of economic migration policy which served to inform many elements of this Bill.  The Bill seeks to build upon the existing employment permits system which has provided a strong framework to supplement skills and labour needs in the State in recent years, and ensure it is future-proof, agile and responsive to the dynamic Irish labour market.  It gives priority, correctly in our view, to the ability of the system to adapt to rapid changes of a positive or negative nature in the needs of the labour market of the future.  This will support the competitiveness of business in Ireland while still prioritising the Irish and EEA labour pool, continuing to safeguard the labour market, and supporting the employment rights of permit holders.  However, its success will be ultimately judged by how it delivers.  This is a complex area that requires collaboration from all stakeholders, including business, if we are to respond to the changing needs of our economy and its citizens.  It is essential that business is supported to remain competitive and agile against a backdrop of the pandemic, Brexit, globalisation, changing demographics and consumer preferences and that we ensure the capacity of business not only to meet existing demands but to grow with the needs of the market.  This will require a combination of workers, including those requiring employment permits.<\/p> <p>  Industry remains committed to enhancing our indigenous skills supply to meet labour market needs through a combination of upskilling and reskilling programmes.  This has been demonstrated through collaborations between industry and education on various Skillnet, Springboard and apprenticeship programmes and the ICT skills action plans aimed at building the domestic supply of high-level ICT graduates.  Employers will also engage fully in the labour market activation measures proposed for the pandemic recovery effort.  Despite this, we know that given the fast-paced, changing global business model, education and training cannot meet all demands in real time.  Developments in infrastructure, increased capacity, innovation and changing skills needs take time.  However, some sectors are simultaneously experiencing levels of growth that are seeing demand far outweigh supply.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme has identified several areas where flexibility and responsiveness can be built into the system.  These include reforming the operational features of the labour market needs test to align with the appropriate job advertising practices used by employers today.  This will also have the effect of being more targeted and focused in reaching Irish and European jobseekers first.  Introducing a seasonal employment permit will bring us in line with other jurisdictions and help alleviate labour market demands during peak production or delivery times in specific sectors.  The introduction of a special circumstances employment permit to deal with occasional exceptional circumstances where an employment permit may be granted for an unusual but important skill set and streamlining the processes for trusted partner and renewal applications.<\/p> <p>  The Bill also retains sensible rules such as the 50:50 rule.  However, there remains an issue with how that rule is administered and this is hampering job growth for some employers that operate multiple businesses in Ireland and results in the loss of jobs and projects to other international jurisdictions.<\/p><p>Due to their group legal structure, they must adhere to the 50:50 rule at multiple levels despite acting as a group in terms of their growth of jobs and employment and contribution to the economy.  Many find a disproportionate number of critical skills vacancies arising in specific teams leading to an imbalance in 50:50 levels despite the overall group being within the requirements.  This issue arises from the administrative decision to use the Revenue Commissioners employer registration number as the identifier for tracking compliance.  To prevent the Irish economy losing out, it is essential that a solution to this be found to help to grow the critical skills roles and the associated jobs in the Irish labour market.  <\/p><p> Despite its many strengths, the general scheme, unfortunately, does not directly tackle the issue of the low-skilled and unskilled workers who are also needed to support the maintenance and growth of industry in certain sectors.  Shortages among lower-skilled workers and subsequent pressure on wages have the potential to be as harmful to the Irish economy as a shortage of skilled labour.  This is particularly the case for indigenous businesses that are predominantly based in sectors that use a high proportion of low-skill labour, such as the care, manufacturing and agrifood sectors.  The absence of this category of worker is not being addressed by the pool of resident workers, and these sectors are not in a position to compete with higher-paying sectors owing to their low margins.  Failing to resolve this crisis is likely to endanger existing business and limit the ability of organisations to take on new business opportunities internationally.  In the longer term, this will also impact their ability to meet Department targets set for certain sectors &ndash; for example, targets under Food Wise 2025.<\/p><p> Many of the impacted workers in the care and food processing sectors remain on the ineligible list, thus stunting the ability of businesses to meet existing needs, let alone grow.  This is also impacting workforce development because some employers struggle to staff a shift, let alone release people for learning and development.  Given our commitments to lifelong learning as a way to remain competitive, this is a worrying trend.  <\/p><p> IBEC believes a model such as the lower-skilled occupations visa used in Canada or the essential skills work visa in New Zealand could offer opportunities and parameters that could suit Ireland's need for lower-skilled general operatives beyond what the general employment permit offers.  The eligibility requirements are for the equivalent of a high-school diploma or two years' job-specific training, and such visas define the duration, wages and conditions for the workers' stay in the country.<\/p><p> One of the challenges in the provision of low-skilled workers that arose during the review of economic migration policy concerned how greater access to low-skilled immigrant workers may stifle innovation and the automation of certain roles.  However, many of the sectors in question are sectors where future automation is not possible or where a transition to automation away from labour will be slow and costly, such as in social care and healthcare.  These jobs require unpredictable, non-routine work involving personal interaction and emotional intelligence rather than artificial intelligence and are not easily replaced by automation.  As such, the repeated reference to conditionality around knowledge transfer and process innovation to be prescribed in regulations is one that many employers may struggle with.<\/p><p> In an increasingly uncertain global environment, policy must continue to innovate and challenge boundaries.  New ways to attract migrants must be adopted to meet the labour market needs that extend beyond our capacity.  Failure to meet the skills and labour market demands will do untold, long-term damage to elements of our economy.<\/p><p> The general scheme reflects a welcome Bill that aims to provide a more responsive and agile employment permit system for Ireland.  In doing so, it will support the economy and its ambitions for growth while future-proofing the system for the expected ebbs and flows of the labour market.

The proposed legislation was considered by this committee in 2019 and, as part of that process, Congress made a written submission.  While much has changed since 2019, the concerns raised in that submission form the basis of my remarks today.  If members would like a copy of the submission of 2019, we can provide it to them later.<br\/><br\/>Before commenting specifically on the proposed legislation, we would question whether this is the appropriate time to be making the proposed changes.  When this legislation was first proposed in 2019, there were very low levels of unemployment.  However, because of the pandemic and the associated public health restrictions, around 500,000 people are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  This is on top of the number receiving the jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  While it is likely that a substantial number of these workers will return to employment following the pandemic, nobody can predict with any certainty how many jobs will be permanently lost.  In our view, it would be prudent not to proceed with this legislation until the end of the pandemic, when a clearer picture will have emerged on the numbers of workers who are unemployed.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Turning to the specific proposals in the proposed legislation, it is important to note that migrant workers have played and continue to play a key role in the Irish economy.  The key issue for Congress and our affiliated unions concerns the rights migrants have when they come to work in Ireland and how these rights can be vindicated.  We have reviewed the proposed legislation from this perspective and we are concerned that some of the proposed changes will further undermine the position of migrant workers in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As Dr. McGann stated, the legislation proposes to introduce a seasonal work permit.  We regard this as particularly problematic.  The problem that arises is ensuring that workers employed on such permits have the appropriate terms and conditions of employment.  However, because the work permit will be issued for a short period, the difficulties with enforcement will multiply and the difficulties for workers in securing redress will increase exponentially.  It has been argued by some that Ireland is an outlier in the EU by not having seasonal work permits.  If alignment with other European countries is to take place, it must be genuine.  This involves aligning all labour standards, including the right to collective bargaining.<br\/><br\/>It is proposed to restructure the labour market test so that it is easier for employers to demonstrate they have sought to fill vacancies within the EU and EEA.  It is a fundamental plank of our labour market policy that where employment vacancies arise, they should be advertised domestically in the first instance and then in the EU and EEA.  It is only when vacancies cannot be filled from these sources that a work permit can be sought.  The changes proposed have the potential to severely undermine this important labour market regulation.  It is also proposed that the rules would be no longer prescribed in primary legislation but in regulations and statutory instruments.  Providing that primary legislation may be replaced by regulations has the potential to undermine the role of the Oireachtas and, in turn, frustrate public scrutiny.  <br\/><br\/>The introduction of a special circumstances work permit is also proposed.  We understand that this new type of work permit would be available in circumstances where a specific niche need has been identified and the normal conditions attaching to the granting of a work permit cannot be fulfilled.  It is proposed that the rules for the granting of such work permits be provided for in regulations.  We suggest that further scrutiny is required to determine the extent to which there is a need for this type of work permit.  If it has been established that there is a genuine need for this, the rules applying to the operation of the scheme should be prescribed in primary legislation.<br\/><br\/>Congress recognises the valuable role that migrant workers play in our country.  They play a crucial role in providing many important public services.  During the pandemic, they have been crucial to the functioning of the health service.  We are concerned that the proposed legislation seems to be addressing the needs of employers only and is aimed at making it easier for employers to obtain work permits.  There are no proposals in the draft legislation to enhance and protect migrant workers or to ensure they are guaranteed their employment rights while working here.<br\/><br\/>Leaving aside the shortcomings in the proposed Bill and the balancing measures that might be put in place, we question whether it is appropriate to make such fundamental changes to the work permits regime when there is great uncertainty over the state of the labour market and the rates of unemployment we will face when the pandemic is over.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to take questions.  I apologise for the notifications that could be heard on my laptop as I was speaking.  I do not know how to turn them off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>That is no bother.

I want to address the issue of the seasonal employment permits in the first instance because I find them to comprise the most troubling aspect of this legislation.  I want to put some questions to the representatives of IBEC.  By way of context, I want to refer to answers that were sent to us by the Department in response to questions I asked last week.<\/p><p>Regarding initiatives undertaken in respect of the meat processing sector, the Department stated that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, had been active in the sector for a number of years carrying out inspections.  I will not read all of the replies, but the important figure is the 46% of inspections that detected breaches of employment law to some extent, for example, adequate records, working time, pay issues and employment permit issues.  The WRC recovered almost &euro;184,000 in outstanding wages.  It is shocking that we are not just discussing bringing more workers into that environment but also shortening the time they are in Ireland.  As ICTU pointed out in its submission, this greatly hinders workers' ability to vindicate their legal rights because it is not possible for people to get organised or become familiar with their legal entitlements if they are only in Ireland for a couple of months.  We see from this information that, in some instances, we cannot trust employers in this regard.  As we found out, 46% of employers were not adhering to the requirements.  In light of this, do the representatives from IBEC believe it is fair to bring workers into that environment?  Clearly, the issues in question have not been addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#B00500","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Regardless of whether a worker is on a permit, the fundamental position that all employees, including those on permits, have the protection of employment rights legislation is not impacted.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned seasonal work permits specifically.

We know from across the range of industries that need seasonal workers that this is a pressing need, one that cannot be met locally.  We are continuing to look locally, though.  For example, Teagasc and the Department of Social Protection initiated the help to harvest programme last year.  It was not very successful, but employers are keen to engage again this year, take the lessons from last year and, it is hoped, increase the number of local workers who join the programme.<\/p> <p>  Regarding breaches of the legislation, from talking to colleagues in other sectors, they welcome the announced and unannounced inspections and those breaches being addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kara McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Dr. McGann referred to the lessons of last year.

The Department's name is too long to say.  At the webinar, the Minister launched his Department's strategy statement for the next three years.  A large emphasis was placed on reskilling and upskilling workers in the economy.  There was a particular emphasis on apprenticeships and ensuring they could address the economy's skills needs.  The statement included an ambitious target of increasing the number of apprenticeships.  That is an initiative I hope will address some of the issues that the Deputy has referenced as well as some of the gaps in employers' workforces.<\/p> <p>  Those present may know that I am a member of the WRC's board.  I imagine what Deputy O'Reilly has pointed out is merely the tip of the iceberg.  In the early 2000s, an agreement was reached between ICTU and the Government to have 90 labour inspectors in the WRC.  That figure has never been reached.  Currently, the WRC has 47 inspectors.  Imagine what would be uncovered if it had its full complement of inspectors.  The Deputy's point is a valid one and there is a great deal of exploitation in some parts of the economy, although not in all.  The statistic would be much more shocking if the WRC had its full complement of inspectors available to it to carry out this work.  Perhaps this is an issue the committee can consider in its consideration of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>It is a very important issue which I hope the committee will consider.  It is an area which we do not often get to shine a light on.  I shudder to think of what happens to those workers when the spotlight goes off them and the inspectors pack their bags and go home.  We have been told repeatedly that this is an issue because we are dealing with companies that operate with a low margin but when we are talking about meat processing, we are talking about companies such as the Goodman Group making &euro;170 million profit in 2018 with assets of more than &euro;3.45 billion.  We are certainly talking about low pay; I am not convinced that we are talking about low margins because it does not seem to me that the profits are not being made.  The push is on to increase the numbers here but it is clear that exploitation is rife in this sector.  Every report that is conducted points to that.  Mr. Berney, by way of his own experience, has advised us of that.  We know if there were more inspectors, they would be uncovering more breaches which should give us pause for thought.<\/p> <p>  I want to reflect for a moment on the submission from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, with regard to the timing of this.  There is a huge amount of uncertainty for workers at the moment.  When and how the economy will restart is somewhat unknowable.  Do the representatives from IBEC have an opinion about the timing of this particular legislation and the call for alignment which in some respects might be welcomed, but it is never alignment when it comes to outlawing low-hour contracts, recognition for trade unions or the right to collective bargaining.  If we are going to talk about alignment, would the representatives from IBEC be happy if we were to align on all fronts with the others and not just pick the minimum or race down to the bottom but that we would actually have the type of alignment that would also benefit workers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#D00100","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>On the timing of the legislation, we are conscious of the current conditions and are also preparing for a post-pandemic labour market, given that the legislation is for the long term.

While the upskilling and reskilling programmes that Mr. Berney referred to are in place with a view to the long term, we are still seeing a need for workers and for employment permits to come through as well.  It is part of a long-term plan, and being cognisant of the situation around labour market activation which we know employers will get behind, there is still a place for this.

Overall, the Bill will make a significant impact by allowing greater flexibility for employment permits and modernising the existing legislation.  Pre-Covid, there was significant feedback from sectors including agriculture about how challenging it was for operators to fill certain positions.  The introduction of seasonal work permits will go some way to addressing this.<\/p> <p>  I take ICTU's point about the uncertainty around what the economy will look like after Covid.  However, my clear understanding is that in all countries which have seasonal work permits, including all our fellow EU member states, there has been a constant need for the permit regardless of the economy.  The most stark example is probably in Greece.  At the height of its crisis, despite extremely high levels of unemployment, evidence shows there was still a need for the seasonal work permit.  I also appreciate ICTU's concerns around enforcement regarding any exploitation of the scheme and the terms and conditions for these workers.  The Department has said workers on a seasonal work permit will have their entitlements upheld which is welcome.  We need to ensure this is the case.  If not, severe penalties should be put in place to deter the minority who may consider exploiting workers on such a scheme, including substantial financial penalties, and that any such exploitation will bar companies from future participation in the scheme.  That would be vital. <\/p> <p>  I have two questions for Dr. McGann.  She outlined valid concerns around the implementation of the 50:50 rule.  Is there any obvious solution to that or is it simply a case that Revenue needs to adjust how it carries out its oversight role?  Will Dr. McGann explain more about IBEC's proposal for Ireland to introduce a programme such as the lower skills occupations visa in Canada or the essential skills work visa in New Zealand?  My knowledge is limited enough but friends have used the essential skills visa in New Zealand, and built up very successful careers and lives there and speak very highly of it.  Will Dr. McGann outline what they offer that the general employment permit does not?  Is IBEC aware of challenges or issues such programmes have presented in Canada or New Zealand?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#D00500","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>The 50:50 rule seems to be down to the decision to use that particular identifier number.  If a cluster identifier number was used instead, then the 50:50 rule as a group would overcome that particular challenge.  What is happening is, say, a company which has four entities in Ireland and, for intellectual property reasons, one is grouped around certain stills, they can find that a particular need for those critical skills falls into one or other of the four entities.<\/p><p>Whereas as a group it is meeting the 50:50 needs completely, one entity may fall out of line.  We are seeing that it is leading to the loss of jobs and substantial projects to other international jurisdictions.  As it is a kind of technical administrative issue, it could totally be overcome by the use of a different identifier, such as a cluster identifier.<\/p><p> On the low-skills occupation visa in Canada and the essential skills work visa in New Zealand, the eligibility around particular visas is around a high-skills diploma or two years of specific training.  People can stay in the country from six to 24 months, with all of this set by the state.  As such, it would fill immediate labour shortage where gaps exist.  The visas would define the duration, wages and the conditions for stay.  What would be different to how we stand currently is that there are still roles on the ineligible lists because they do not meet the criteria around the general permits that would fit within this cohort of permits and allow that flexibility within the system.  In particular, in the care sector, for example, there may be particular needs at a particular time not meeting the criteria but there may be grave demand for them.  What we have heard is that in those countries they can lead a pathway to meeting needs locally and potentially transferring to others if there was a desire to keep them in the country.  There is a capacity to do that if desired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kara McGann","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I welcome our speakers.

Have we seen people with work permits returning?  Will there be an expectation of many renewals coming up?  We know that areas in the caring sector are under very severe pressure but what is happening in other areas of the economy where there is a higher density of low-skill, as opposed to high-skill, personnel?  We know about the story in the high-skills sectors.  As Mr. Berney indicates, there are concerns about high unemployment.  We must also be fair to people who have expectations and so on and we must have a system that works.<\/p><p>A second point concerns apprenticeships and upskilling.  To what extent do IBEC or ICTU have evidence that sectors which are big users of the permit scheme are running apprenticeships and have they stepped up their performance with such apprenticeships?  What is the blockage?  There is a CAO process for going to third level but there is no equivalent clearing house for people who want to opt into apprenticeships.  Has either IBEC or ICTU thoughts on how to develop an easier way of getting in?  Currently it is about getting individual employment contracts and it is very much who one knows.  It can be tricky.<\/p><p>I take the point made about the meat industry and it seems there are problems.  Equally, it would not be fair to pick one sector, looking at all the potential offences and say it represents all employers using these schemes.  We should not visit on those who work in a legitimate way the failings of those who abuse the processes.  I am interested in the comments of both ICTU and IBEC on something mentioned by the previous speaker; should there be a clearer way that if the mechanism is abused, it will be closed to a party for a certain period.  Do we need to see some sort of <i>quid pro quo<\/i>in this regard?<\/p><p>Mr. Berney has said there are no legislative changes here for migrant workers.  What is he suggesting?  In general we have tended to say the same labour law applies to everybody.

In the information and communications technology sector, for example, there is an apprenticeship model that is being used and we have seen others engage in the apprenticeship model.  As the Deputy says, it can be challenging.  In the past there has been a perception of third level versus apprenticeships and we really need to change that perception.  In some cases it is with the parents of Ireland and broadening our understanding of further and higher education, including the opportunities offered by apprenticeships to earn and learn in a way that is very attractive.  People can look at the opportunities this offers but there is a perception issue we must address.  It is work we are absolutely engaging in at this time.<\/p> <p>  There was also a question on abuses in the area and there are fines, court appearances and engagement with the Workplace Relations Commission.

I do not have any sense that there has been a massive reduction in the number of migrant numbers in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is in fact self-evident that if we did not have the migrant workers in the health service, we would have been in much deeper trouble.  The migrant workers in the health service by and large work for the HSE and get the same treatment,  and terms and conditions of employment.  I could not absolutely say the same for the private healthcare institutions such as private nursing homes etc.  Establishing a joint labour committee for migrant workers in private nursing homes would improve their position.<\/p><p>It would make a significant difference.  I know a report was done on the private nursing home sector recently which recommended that very thing.  That report directed that activity towards the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to look at.  Again, that is perhaps something the committee could consider.<\/p><p> The number of apprenticeships in Ireland is increasing but from a very low level.  Colleagues from IBEC and Deputy Bruton have pointed to some of the barriers to apprenticeships, one of which is that in the first year, certainly of the traditional craft apprenticeships, a person must first find a sponsoring employer.  Sometimes, if a person cannot find a sponsoring employer, the apprenticeship is closed off to him or her.  Perhaps a structural change whereby apprentices spend the first eight or nine months of their training in the training college, as opposed to having to find an apprentice sponsor, might be a way of making a significant difference to the number of apprenticeships.<\/p><p> The State and public sector employers have a very important role to play here because predominantly, apprentices are hired by private sector employers.  If the State were to up its game in terms of making apprenticeships available to young people and also adult learners, I believe that would make a significant difference.<\/p><p> On the question of asking the Low Pay Commission for its views on the treatment of migrant workers, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, might be a better place to start.  Ask it to give the committee a view as to its experience with carrying out inspections in places where migrant workers are employed to actually see what their experience is.<\/p><p> As I said in a previous contribution, I am on the board.  We do not get the full range of information, however.  I cannot, therefore, really comment in any great detail except to say there is a problem with exploitation in some parts of the economy.  To be clear with everybody here, from an ICTU perspective, migrant workers are not the problem.  The problem is the treatment migrant workers get when they arrive here.  Unfortunately, they fall into the hands of some terrible, unscrupulous employers.  That is the difficulty.  If we could be guaranteed that a migrant worker coming here would have the exact same treatment as any other worker in the economy, then perhaps this kind of discussion would not be necessary.  Unfortunately, however, that is not the lived experience of all migrant workers.<\/p><p> I hope that deals with the questions asked by Deputy Bruton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Berney.

It is a person not having a CAO place or, as Mr. Berney said, needing an individual sponsor.  I absolutely agree with him.  We need to see the State in there as a player and as an employer, not just as provider of the skills.

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  It is good to hear from different perspectives.  I will make a couple of comments and ask a couple of questions.<\/p> <p>  First, I have spoken to the head of Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, ETB, and to guidance counsellors about apprenticeships.  One of the issues seems to be that apprenticeships often start in January.  I also raised this in the Seanad.  It is hard for a young person leaving school in June to twiddle his or her thumbs until the following January when most of his or her equals are going to have a laugh for the summer and then go to college in September.  We really need to look at that.<\/p> <p> It is prohibitive that a person must be on social welfare for at least six months before he or she can take up many of these apprenticeships.  We really need to change that.  Why tell people to stay on social welfare for six months to take up an apprenticeship?  Why is starting in January so common among apprenticeships?  I would really like to hear some information on that one simple issue.  Can we change that in some way?  I know from speaking with many of my guidance counsellor friends who work in secondary schools that when their students seek to take up apprenticeships, in many cases they must wait until January.  I would like information on that.  In addition, it would perhaps save the State money if we are not asking them all to go on the dole for six months.  The sooner they get stuck into something else, the better it is for them.  It is never good for anybody to stay on social welfare if he or she does not want to do so.<\/p> <p>  I will raise a couple of other issues.  I know from talking to the heads of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, that when they carry out training, it is uncertified.  That means they are upskilling many of the small employees but not similarly qualifying them.  A huge issue in the SME sector, which accounts for a big portion of our employees and employers, is that when they carry out training, it is not certified.  I know from teaching in the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, and Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, that it is not that hard to reach the specific learning outcomes for modules to get certification in education.<\/p> <p>  I would love to see the LEOs working with the education and training board, ETB, and IBEC perhaps getting involved in some way to encourage that by looking at the apprenticeships and skills needed and seeing how they can fit into some kind of FETAC level 5, 6, 7 or 8 module, depending on what skills they are bringing to it.<\/p> <p>  Where are the 90 WRC inspectors?  What we are doing about getting more of them.  Everybody here wants every employee and employer to be treated well.  Therefore, if we do not have enough WRC inspectors, can we as a committee ask when we are getting the rest of them?  If we only have 47 inspectors out of 90, what is the plan for getting a few more?  What happens with those inspections?  What is the follow-up?<\/p> <p>  I have been a migrant worker.  I emigrated to America and Germany in my time and encountered language barrier and bad payment issues.  Luckily, an Irish lad, who is now actually a millionaire, set up a support company for getting tax back for people.  At the time, we could go to him and he could stand up for us.  It is, however, very hard for a young migrant to be empowered to stand up for himself or herself.  Therefore, the thought of meat factory workers getting mistreated is terrible.  The meat factory workers and their employers, who are in the minority, are not the benchmark we should be working off for the employers or employees.  It is one small section of the whole issue around workers' rights.<\/p> <p>  It is great that the Government has agreed to 10,000 apprenticeships overall.  The will is there from Government; we now need to figure out the \"how\" of it all.  At least the will is there, which is great; 10,000 per year is a good figure to aim towards.  We now need to figure out how to do it.  I know the Ministers, Deputies McEntee and O'Gorman, are working on the direct provision centre issue.  It occurs to me that we have more than 5,000 asylum seekers.<\/p><p>Many of them are extremely well qualified.  If we are stuck for qualified people in the workforce, let us see what we can do about speeding up the process relating to asylum seekers.  It would be madness to bring people in from other countries if we already have them in our direct provision centres.  I think the Ministers, Deputies McEntee and O'Gorman, might finally be beginning to bring about an end to all that madness.  One meets doctors, labourers, brain surgeons and carpenters in direct provision centres, so that is something to consider.<\/p><p> The twice-yearly skills needs assessment is brilliant.  It will be interesting to see where the gaps exist.  They should maybe become part of the committee's focus.  If there are glaringly obvious skill shortages in certain areas, based on that twice-yearly assessment, let us find out what they are and what we can do about shifting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#F00900","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The Senator has two minutes left so if she wants a response from IBEC or ICTU, she might ask now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#G00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>The final question was about IBEC and ICTU working with ETBs.

We have looked at it with our Reboot and Reimagine campaign with regard to Generation Apprenticeship and the focus on that as a clear and active option both for activation and for skills generally.<\/p> <p>  Uncertified training and upskilling are important.  Micro-credentials which we can build on, leading to bigger awards, are important.  We need to make that as user-friendly as possible so that we can see greater uptake and engagement because as the Senator says, it is possible to create a learning pathway, so we should increase that, especially when we have an ethos of lifelong learning to keep ourselves competitive.  It seems nonsensical not to address that to encourage and grow the level of qualification that people are gaining when upskilling.<\/p> <p>  On asylum seekers in direct provision, IBEC has a long history of diversity and inclusion work.

One thing that struck me in looking over the heads of the Bill was that the penalties for employers breaching the rules seem relatively low.  The penalties for employers not having an employment permit, for example, are a fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 on indictment.  That is the same amount of money as was the case in the 2003 Act, despite 18 years of inflation.  Similarly, the fines for major fraud, forgery, etc., are also relatively low and the maximum fine is &euro;50,000.  Circumstances could arise where a company such as Gama Construction could be involved in substantial abuse of the scheme and only face a maximum fine of &euro;50,000.<\/p><p>Is that something ICTU has looked at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#H02000","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Our view is that it is not particularly appropriate to change this legislation as things currently stand.

Perhaps it would be useful for her to express her concerns to her colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, who is developing the action plan.  In our submission to the Departments on their action plan, we raised some of the same questions the Senator has mentioned.<\/p> <p>  She referred to construction.  It is a complex sector.  There are a couple of things that are important to say about construction.  First, construction is one area where there are advanced systems of social dialogue, collective bargaining and all of the rest of that.  That has resulted in sectoral wage making mechanisms in construction in order that people are properly paid and so on.  I do not want people to have the impression, however, that construction is perfect because it is far from it.  A large proportion of workers in construction are classified as being self-employed when they are actually employees.  It is a disincentive for people to work in construction because there is a growing practice of misclassification of workers in the sector.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues from IBEC are very reluctant to get into this area because they do not represent construction employers in general.  The Construction Industry Federation is the representative body.  The problem with apprenticeships at the moment is that there are structural barriers in their way.  One thing that would make a world of difference tomorrow would be for new apprentices to do the first eight months of their apprenticeships in training colleges, as opposed to getting have to get employers to sponsor them.

A number of statements were made on the rationale for the appeal to extend the employment permits system, which has been made on the basis of low-margin sectors, the need to maintain competitiveness and, by extension, low wages within particular sectors.  We need to see more evidence from IBEC on this.  I note, in particular, the reliance on the CSO regarding the claim that the red meat sector is a low-margin sector.  I am looking at the CSO and the NACE Rev. 2 classification and I am highly dubious that the red meat sector can be pulled out from the CSO data currently available, both privately and publicly.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that some of the Dr. McGann's colleagues in IBEC have a strong tradition of proper use of statistics, and data, from the CSO.  We are at risk of misleading the committee by repeatedly saying that red meat sector is a low-margin sector because know the red meat sector is one defined by a small number of very large operators.  It is akin to an oligopoly and there are, as said previously, very significant profits in that sector.  I would like IBEC to come back and provide more evidence as to the low-margin nature of the sectors it has spoken about.<\/p> <p>  Much has been said about the enforcement regime and the clear need both for additional inspectors in the labour inspectorate and to up the game on enforcement.  A clear message has to go out from the committee, and, indeed, to IBEC, that if we want a more permissive permit system then we need to have very strong confidence in the enforcement system.  That confidence does not exist at the moment.  It is incumbent on IBEC, if it wants a more permissive permit system, which I do not believe in, to ensure there is a stronger enforcement system and a stronger degree of confidence that misdemeanours will be picked up.<\/p> <p>  There is a necessary conversation to be had on fines, deterrents and one strike and people should be out.  Mr. Berney referred earlier to three misdemeanours followed by more serious consequences.  I do not believe that is acceptable.  It is incumbent, particularly on the largest employers' representative group in the country, to very much add its voice to the need for stronger enforcement.  We can then have the conversation about a more permissive permit system, but I do not think the permit system can come before the enforcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#L00400","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I agree with the Senator's comments.

It highlights some of the practices in the meat sector, which, unfortunately, are not great.  Senator Garvey talked about meat processing being singled out at this meeting.  Meat processing is not the only sector where there are problems; there are particular problems in agriculture and horticulture.<\/p> <p>  There are significant problems for people who come to this country on work permits.  The issue around the short-term work permit is hugely problematic for colleagues in Congress.  It would be, in our view, systematically abused because if somebody comes here on a work permit for two months and they find out after three weeks they are being paid less than the minimum wage, it will take them at least six to eight weeks to have that processed through the WRC.  By that time, they will have gone back to their home country.  Why would an employer not do that, if it was minded to?

We know there is exploitation going on, whether it is a majority or minority of employers.  I suspect it is a minority, but I imagine for those workers to whom it is happening, it is not of massive interest whether it is happening to many other workers because it is happening to them.  There are serious issues.  This has been a useful meeting because it is clear the introduction of a seasonal employment permit, as described, will only serve to exacerbate the situation.  We, therefore, need more enforcement, more personnel to do that enforcement and more employers to come on board, because clearly some are not.  Let us be frank: the workers are not exploiting themselves.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the views of the IBEC representatives on mechanisms that exist such as a joint labour committee, JLC.  That is proposed for one of the sectors.  We have highlighted four: meat processing, horticulture, agriculture and the delivery of private healthcare.  Regarding those sectors and the need to improve the situation of workers in them, there is work to be done.<\/p><p>It would be appropriate to pause this legislation until the requisite number of inspectors have been appointed and the JLC for the care sector has been established.  Is there an urgent need for this legislation to go through now in the middle of a global pandemic?  With respect, this has not been addressed by any of the witnesses before the committee.  It seems as if people are thinking, \"Let's not waste a good crisis.\"  The landscape of the labour market will have changed when we get to the end of this, if we ever get to the end of it.

I know that the representatives from IBEC did not come here today to do the bidding of rogue employers.  I also know that it wants the workers to be treated decently.  We know they are not being treated decently and there is no point in us pretending that they are.  We know they are not and we have seen the evidence.  In the absence of mechanisms being in place, would it be a good idea to pause what we are doing now and put the necessary mechanisms in place for those workers to ensure their terms and conditions can be protected?  I am talking about basic stuff such as using language that people can understand on the employment permit outlining where they can go to access information about their minimum rights and entitlements.  Those basic things need to be done first.<\/p><p> Clearly, there is bigger stuff involved, including in the context of the JLC.  Employers can repeatedly offend and can repeatedly abuse them.  There is nothing to stop them simply moving on to the next worker when they get caught out.  Many protections need to be put in place before we consider expanding a scheme like this which, I think we have established, is open to wholesale abuse.  I do not suggest that the witnesses have come in here to represent the employers that abuse it.  However, it would be silly to say they do not abuse it when they do.

I certainly hope we do sooner rather than later.<\/p> <p>  I know I am repeating the point.  Equipping the WRC to do its job properly is crucial to this.  I tend to agree with the Deputy that 90 is probably insufficient for the current labour market.  The numbers in employment have increased exponentially.  Even leaving the pandemic aside, the numbers in employment have increased exponentially since that figure of 90 was fixed upon.  It would be useful and informative for the committee to invite representatives of the WRC to appear before it.  I am sure Mr. Liam Kelly and his colleagues in the WRC would be happy to appear before the committee to give their view on that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021030900002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, we need to end the meeting now because we have run out of time.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss \"Nothing about us without us - achieving equal rights and equity for women with disabilities\" and to celebrate women with disabilities in the context of International Women's Day, which took place yesterday.  We recognise that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination and that positive measures need to be taken to ensure they are protected against multiple forms of discrimination and can enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis equal with that of other citizens, which is called for by Article 6 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  The committee recognises the scale of the work ahead and that the rights of women and girls with disabilities must be included in all actions aimed at implementing the UN xonvention.  It has been pointed out over the past 48 hours that 25% of women with disabilities in our country live in poverty.  As a committee, we should strive to do whatever we can to advance the causes of all people with disabilities and in particular women.  One quarter of women with disabilities live in poverty, which is a frightening statistic that we should bear in mind at all times.<\/p> <p>  On my own behalf and on that of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Ms Catherine Lane, women in local, community and rural development officer at the National Women's Council of Ireland; and to Ms Maureen McGovern, disability community activist, and Ms Selina Bonnie, vice chairperson of the Independent Living Movement Ireland, who are appearing on behalf of the National Women's Council.  I also welcome Ms Amy Hassett and Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta, co-directors of Disabled Women Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I remind members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask that those who are joining us remotely confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making a contribution to the meeting.  A good number of members have joined us for the meeting in the D&aacute;il Chamber and I welcome them.<\/p> <p>  For the information of anyone watching the meeting online, I point out that witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances, I ask everybody to bear with us should any technical matters arise, which they do from time to time.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw the attention of members and witnesses to the issue of parliamentary privilege.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts should note that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I invite Ms Lane of the National Women's Council of Ireland to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#A00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>The National Women&rsquo;s Council welcomes the invitation to speak to the committee and present at this sitting celebrating disabled women on International Women's Day.

I have been a strong activist for the human rights of disabled people at local level for most of my life.  My work is informed by the issues of concern to me as a disabled woman and member of the local non-governmental organisation, NGO, Disability Action Collective, in the Ballyfermot and Chapelizod area, which has the largest population of disabled people in an urban setting at 20%.<\/p> <p>  My work is underpinned by an understanding of the social model of disability.  This model indicates that disability is caused by the way society is organised rather than by a person's impairment.  It looks at ways of removing barriers that restrict life choices for disabled people.  I also work from a disability equality perspective.  This is a belief that I, or we as disabled people, should enjoy equal rights and opportunities to participate in economic, social and cultural life, have choice and control over how we live our lives and are enabled to reach our full potential.<\/p> <p>  As a disabled woman who has experienced sexual violence over a long period, I did not get the same supports that a non-disabled woman would have at that particular time.  We have made a small bit of progress in this area but for all disabled women to live free from violence, more action is urgency required.  After years of working really hard to get an understanding of the issue, I believe the following:<\/p> <p>  Disabled women are not visible in the wider response to violence against women.  Data on disabled women do not always exist but the following statistics highlight disabled women&rsquo;s increased vulnerability to violence.  The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, in an EU-wide survey in 2014, found 34% of women with a health problem or disability have experienced physical or sexual partner violence, compared with 19% of women who do not have a health problem or disability.  Recent research from NUI Galway found that disabled women are more likely to experience violence, with 40% of disabled female students reporting experience of rape, compared with 27% of non-disabled students.<\/p> <p>  More resources are needed to ensure access to support for disabled women across the country.  It is vital they know that supports exist and that our safety is paramount, particularly during this public health crisis.  Alongside this, disabled survivors of abuse should be involved in designing better support and accessible awareness raising campaigning.  For example, there should be more visibility of disabled women in the \"no more excuses\" campaigns.  We know home is not a safe place for many women.<\/p> <p>  More research is needed to understand the dynamics of domestic abuse and institutional abuse and to ensure legislation adequately protects all women.  Disabled women living in congregated or institutional settings or with families may find accessing specialist support agencies difficult due to a lack of privacy or access to digital devices.  The Second National Strategy on Domestic Sexual and Gender-Based Violence 2016-2021 has no targeted interventions with disabled women and we urgently need consistent and quality data on disabled women&rsquo;s experiences of gender and sexual-based violence.<\/p> <p>  Disabled women are under-represented across all levels of leadership in public and political life.  We do not have an identified disabled woman representative in the Oireachtas and there is only one disabled woman councillor in local government.  As a disabled woman who is very active in my local community, I often feel my voice is not listened to due to my impairment and gender, which affects my mental health greatly.  I am not the only disabled woman who has been subject to this experience and this affects disabled women across the country fighting for the rights of disabled women to fully participate for change at local level.<\/p> <p>  We call on the committee and the Government to seek the input of disabled people&rsquo;s organisations, including disabled women&rsquo;s organisations locally and nationally, in all policies that affect disabled people.  As disabled women, we want to see the full realisation of the rights of disabled women, as set out in the UNCRPD.  The State must take the necessary steps to ensure that all disabled women can fully realise their social, cultural, political and economic rights.  I look forward to engaging with the work of the committee further and wish you all a very happy international women&rsquo;s week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGovern for that excellent contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#B00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I am speaking to the committee from Dublin 15.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to share my experiences and observations regarding reproductive justice, particularly for disabled women in 21st-century Ireland.  I am here not only as a member of the National Women's Council disabled women&rsquo;s group and vice chair of Independent Living Movement Ireland but also as a survivor of Irish assisted human reproductive services and a regional ambassador for the NUIG Centre for Disability Law and Policy Re(al) Productive Justice initiative.  I thank Dr. &Aacute;ine Sperrin from Galway for her support with my statement.<\/p> <p>  I speak to the committee as a disabled woman and not a woman with a disability.  This fundamental social rights-based definition underpins my statement and my life.  According to the 2016 census, the total number of disabled persons in Ireland was 643,131, or 13.5% of population.  Almost half are disabled women.  However, little attention has been paid to the specific experiences and needs of disabled women in Ireland.  For example, 63.7% of disabled women are mothers and yet disabled women are not mentioned in our current maternity strategy.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on two key issues of reproductive justice: assisted human reproduction and disabled women&rsquo;s access to essential health services.  Reproductive justice is the ability to make decisions and have choices respected around becoming a parent or not.  This includes fertility, contraception, including assisted human reproduction, abortion, pregnancy, birth and parenting, including fostering and adoption.  The Re(al) Productive Justice project has identified discrimination for disabled people on these issues in many forms.  These include physical infrastructure where reproductive health and parenting services are delivered being inaccessible; historic and contemporary use of long-term contraceptives without informed consent; ableist attitudes across assisted human reproduction, maternity and parenting service staff; a lack of accessible information across all stages of reproductive decision making; a gap in knowledge among health professionals about the support needs of disabled people accessing reproductive services; increased interventions and monitoring of disabled parents that is disproportionate to non-disabled parents; and a lack of uniformity about the use and quality of parental capacity assessments.  There is also a gap in data about the provision of reproductive services to disabled people, particularly with the new framework for abortion services.  Finally, the current legal capacity framework and delay in full realisation of the UNCRPD contributes to violations in this part of disabled persons' lives.<\/p><p> Disabled people with genetic and-or hereditary impairments, particularly disabled women as the female body is the primary site of most assisted human reproduction treatments, often meet significant resistance from the medical profession when attempting to access assisted fertility services.  I have experienced this discrimination.  Based on my personal experience and as an activist and academic in the area of reproductive justice, I have significant concerns about the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017 and its potential negative impact on the rights of disabled people to access assisted human reproduction services.<\/p><p> My main areas of concerns are head 7, which deals with the welfare of the child, and head 30, which deals with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, PGD.  For brevity, rather than detailing my concerns now, I have included them as an appendix to my written statement.  However, my urgent concern is that there is a glaring absence of the voices and experiences of people identifying as disabled in the public meeting list of witnesses and the 31 written submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill.  This situation must be rectified before the Bill progresses. <\/p><p> Due to accessibility issues and lack of universal design in mainstream services, disabled women often experience poorer access to health and social services.  Disabled women experience barriers to accessing health screening services, resulting in lower uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening.  Qualitative and quantitative data are not collected based on disability and it is essential that this be addressed to enable future planning of services so that they will be more accessible and inclusive.  Qualitative data are particularly essential as often the lived experience can radically demonstrate where services that appear inclusive and accessible on paper are failing.  For example, I have heard countless accounts from fellow disabled women of how the services are failing them.<\/p><p> Depending on the equipment available in individual surgeries and the location of colposcopy clinics, many disabled women are faced with significant travel to access services that meet their individual support needs.  Often, the ability of disabled women to access these essential services will depend on accessible transport and an allocation of sufficient personal assistance hours or appropriate Irish Sign Language, ISL, interpretation.  In addition to physical and information access issues, attitudes also have a significant impact.  For example, the CervicalCheck women&rsquo;s charter informs disabled service users: &ldquo;If you have special needs and require assistance in accessing the programme, CervicalCheck will support you&rdquo;.  Disabled women do not have special needs; we have specific access needs.<\/p><p> Regarding disabled women who are wheelchair users, BreastCheck states that some wheelchairs can be used by women using the mammogram machine, depending on the design, size and weight of the chair.  For women whose wheelchairs are not appropriate, a screening chair can be provided to enable access.  It is not mentioned, however, if a hoist will be available.  I have heard many stories concerning disabled wheelchair users who have not been provided with hoist access and who have been made to feel as if they have been in the wrong for needing the access.  In general, there is a significant need for innovation and universal design in the medical field.  Disabled women are not the problem; the responsibility lies with the designers of services and equipment.  If we can put a rover on Mars, surely we can design universally accessible diagnostic or therapeutic equipment.<\/p><p> We need gender sensitive and accessible health services that are delivered with dignity and are sensitive to the diversity of disabled women&rsquo;s needs, experiences and backgrounds.  Every individual has the power to effect change.  Members, as elected representatives, have greater power and therefore also a greater responsibility to use their power, individually and collectively, to effect change.<\/p><p> I will conclude with my recommendations on how positive change can be brought about for disabled women regarding reproductive rights.  These are as follows: ensure data collection is disaggregated by disability in essential areas such as BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and all reproductive health services; strongly advocate for innovation of accessible, inclusive services and universal design; meaningfully address the absence of disabled people&rsquo;s voices and experiences from pre-legislative scrutiny of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017; ensure the ethics committee of the proposed AHR regulatory authority, when established, includes the voices of disabled people; and consider disabled people&rsquo;s access needs in all areas of service provision, not just in the public areas of life such as transport and education.<\/p><p> Access to the realisation of private rights such as reproductive justice is essential for quality of life.  Disabled women need, and have a right to expect, accessible health and reproductive services that are delivered with dignity and are sensitive to the diversity of our needs, experiences and backgrounds.  This includes race, sexuality, gender identity and disability.  I thank members for their time and I hope they enjoy international women&rsquo;s week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Selina Bonnie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bonnie for her contribution, and I ask Ms Amy Hassett to make her opening statement on behalf of Disabled Women Ireland, DWI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#C00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>On behalf of Disabled Women Ireland, I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to speak today.  We welcome the approach of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters in engaging with our representative organisations in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p>  Disabled Women Ireland is the national disabled persons organisation, DPO, representing disabled self-identified women and non-binary people.  A DPO is an independent membership organisation run by and for disabled people.  DPOs are separate from service providers and exist to serve and represent their members on all issues impacting them.  They have an unrivalled expertise and it is essential to bring this to all conversations about disability matters.  Drawing on our collective lived experience, we can provide an analysis of the systematic barriers that impact us and provide the solutions to these issues.  Too often, we find ourselves spoken about but not spoken to.  DPOs must receive meaningful financial and practical support to cultivate this expertise so that we are enabled to have real input in the decisions impacting our lives.  This necessity has been highlighted most recently during the Covid-19 pandemic when DPOs were overlooked and ignored.  This is particularly jarring given that data on disability deaths, to which other experts should supposedly have access, do not seem to exist.  Historically, women have found themselves marginalised and excluded from decisions that impact their lives.  Indeed, the glass ceiling that women have experienced is double-glazed for disabled women.  <\/p> <p>  Disabled women are more likely to be subjected to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, yet a significant proportion of gender-based services in Ireland are not accessible to disabled women, including intimate partner violence supports.  Screening tools, such as CervicalCheck and BreastCheck, are not accessible to many disabled women and nor for that matter are a number of sexual and reproductive healthcare services that others take for granted.  Education and employment attainment is lower among disabled people than in the general population and is notably lower again for disabled women.<\/p> <p>  Disabled people fought for decades for remote learning and employment and were told it was impossible, yet one year ago this week, it was brought in overnight.  For those in employment, there is no guarantee that working from home provisions will be supported as a reasonable accommodation in the aftermath of the pandemic.  Flexible working conditions are particularly important for disabled women, who are more likely to have care responsibilities for children or other family members.  These, among other factors, result in a sizeable portion of disabled women living in consistent poverty.  Ireland is lagging behind the rest of Europe in adequately facing these issues, being one of the five countries with the lowest performance with regard to unemployment rates and the risk of poverty for disabled people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy Hassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hassett, and I ask Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta to make her opening statement to the committee, also on behalf of DWI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#C00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>This is very much a continuation of Ms Hassett's contribution and it was co-written by our membership.<\/p><p>It was encouraging to see some small steps being taken to address the issues causing widespread problems in our community, including the prompt response of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to the barriers facing disabled students offered scholarships, an issue so effectively raised by Catherine Gallagher.  Individual changes are welcome, but we must also look at the systemic approaches which create this environment.  Currently, the majority of supports available to disabled people are means tested.  The Make Work Pay scheme goes some way to alleviating this issue, but disabled people still risk losing their supports if they want to return to work.  This creates barriers for disabled women in particular in that they will experience the gender pay gap as well as the disability pay gap.<\/p><p> Poverty restricts our choices.  It undermines our dignity and it has been a root cause of us experiencing institutionalisation.  We are reminded in 2021 of how inherently abusive institutions are in terms of the shambolic mother and baby homes report.  As we fight to reckon fully with our institutional past, we must also end modern institutions, including nursing homes, psychiatric care facilities, long-term residential care facilities and direct provision and homelessness hubs.  Institutionalisation makes disabled women particularly vulnerable.  At their best, institutions continue to segregate disabled people and deny us our agency.  We also must recognise that private homes can be institutionalised settings when no real option for independent living exists.  Disabled women, in particular older disabled women, need to have choice in regard to where and with whom they live.  Moreover, disabled women need autonomy over all decisions concerning their lives, including autonomy over their finances.  Independent living requires appropriate, secure and accessible housing, but it also requires a rights-based approach to services, including personal assistant services.  Disabled people are the only people still denied legal capacity in Ireland.  It is imperative that disabled women's autonomy is respected so that we are supported to make decisions in all aspects of our lives, be that in regard to reproduction, where and with whom we live or medical treatment.<\/p><p> Today, we task the committee with the following four issues: the allocation of funds to DPOs and women's organisations to ensure the involvement of disabled women in these organisations; to ensure all institutions are relegated to the past where they belong and disabled people are supported to live where and with whom they choose; to ensure all gender-based supports and services are disability-proofed, including gender-based violence supports; and ensure disabled people are not confined to living in poverty through the provision of a non-means-tested disability payment and access to supports and services they need in their lives.<\/p><p> We are here today at the end of the Disabled is not a Dirty Word campaign.  The campaign is a response to the language and approaches to disability which are patronising and distance us from our rights.  We need to move away from terminology that does not serve disabled people.  There is no issue that concerns disabled people that does not impact us specifically as disabled women and non-binary people.  There is no issue that impacts women that does not impact us specifically as disabled women.  As disabled women, we need to be involved in the conversations at every stage of the policymaking on disability and gender issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I thank Ms N&iacute; Fhlartharta, Ms Lane, Ms McGovern, Ms Bonnie and Ms Hassett for their contributions, which were thought provoking and challenging in terms of the committee's work as we endeavour to try to improve the lives of people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Members may use their time for questions, comments and answers or they may use their time to make a statement rather than ask questions.

Good morning to everybody.  I wish a happy international women's week to all of our speakers, female members of the committee and females watching the proceedings.  It is worth noting that this committee is a majority female committee, but that is not true of all of the committees in the Oireachtas, unfortunately.  Some committees have a reasonable number of women.  As members can take up positions on more than one committee, many women take up positions on several committees, but not all committees have female representation.  This is not reflective of the Oireachtas make-up, where 22.5% of Deputies are female.  None of this reflects people with disabilities because the number of disabled people who are elected to the Oireachtas is extremely low, a point made today, including in regard to our councils.  This needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  This committee has an important task.  It was formed to oversee the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As mentioned, it is relevant across all Departments and so we should be holding all Departments to account.  We must ensure issues that affect women and disabled people are dealt with, which combined add up to a large amount of discrimination.  As mentioned by Ms McGovern and others, it is important there is input into this committee by people with the lived experience of a disability.  We must ensure that happens in the case of individuals and DPOs.  One of my questions is around how best we can do that going forward.  The committee has done some outreach work and received some submissions from people in those positions, but we need to ensure we do that in the best way possible.<\/p> <p>  The past year has been taken up by Covid, which has adversely affected women more than men and disabled people more than able-bodied people.  It has led to women having additional chores within the household and in terms of childcare, elderly care and home schooling.  As mentioned, women in employment and people with disabilities in employment are frequently employed on a part-time rather than full-time basis and in less secure employment.  Also, the majority of those on the front-line in our health and essential services are women and they have been adversely affected by Covid.  My prediction is there will be a widening of the gender pay gap and this needs to be tackled as we come out of Covid, it is hoped in the next few months with the roll-out of vaccines.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the statistics provided today about gender violence and the statement that disabled people, disabled women and women with a health problem are more susceptible to violence from a partner.  It is very concerning.  It is more concerning that the supports are not as available to women with a disability as they are to other women.  I am concerned also about the witnesses' commentary that screening programmes such as BreastCheck and CervicalCheck are not available, as they should be, to all women.  This also needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Another issue which I believe is very important is the lack of independent living available, which many of the witnesses referenced.  Our Departments, councils and the HSE have a job to do to ensure all adults have choice in regard to where they live and that the proper supports, including personal assistant hours and so forth, are put in place to ensure that happens.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions, one of which I mentioned earlier in regard to engagement by disabled women, disabled people and DPOs with this committee and how best we can improve that.  Another issue arising out of what many of the witnesses have talked about today is the collection of data and the need to ensure those data are broken down by gender.  If the State does not have sufficient quality data on disabled women, how can that position be measured and responded to effectively?  How can that be improved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#D00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":521,"content":"<p>On the issue of disabled persons organisations and ensuring that disabled voices are heard in policymaking, something that has been particularly significant in our community is the longevity and success of those organisations.  There are incredible disabled persons organisations operating at local and national levels that are entirely unsupported by the Government.  Predominantly when we fund civil society, we do not fund disabled persons organisations, or at least not to the same extent.  We prioritise organisations that are often led by service providers which have a direct conflict of interest.  This is probably most notable in the case of the National Platform of Self-Advocates, which is made up of revolutionary advocates who should be celebrated and supported but have spent the last three years fighting from month to month to exist.  The fact that core funding does not exist for them in that circumstance massively disadvantages people with an intellectual disability.  We are missing out on a key voice in policymaking.

It is notable and important that during international women's week we have the opportunity to speak to women with a disability.  The point was well made in some of the submissions that some women prefer to be called &quot;disabled women&quot;.  Whichever term a person chooses to describe himself or herself is the right way to approach it.<\/p><p>The theme of this year's International Women's Day is &quot;Choose to Challenge&quot;.  We had a two-hour debate in the Seanad yesterday on how we choose to challenge and what we need to choose to challenge in society, particularly from a gender perspective.  In the opening statements we heard today we were made all the more conscious of the challenges facing women.<\/p><p>Starting a conversation on what any one of us can do to challenge the <i>status quo<\/i>and ensure gender balance across all aspects of society is important.  It is also important to celebrate women in their diversity and, today, to place an emphasis on women with disabilities and ensure their voice is heard and their needs are met.  There are many different experiences of being a woman in Ireland and that has to be addressed not just yesterday or this week but throughout the year.  It is time for positive measures for women with disabilities to ensure they and the witnesses, those they represent and their peers have full human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with everybody else.<\/p><p>As a woman, I believe I must help to make sure the fight against inequality breaks down barriers for all women, not just some.  The slogan &quot;Nothing about us without us&quot;, which informed the approach we took to today and has come up in hearings, has to be at the centre of every discussion about women and disabilities.  On Twitter during the week, it was interesting to see the question put as to why people use the term &quot;disability&quot; and to look at some of the responses.  They included the fact that acknowledging a disability has enabled a particular respondent to transcend her illness.  Another woman realised that to try to hide or to be ashamed of her disability serves to uphold the ableist <i>status quo<\/i>.  All of that is important.  One lady replied that she was part of a magnificent, unique group of disabled women with a cultural identity to celebrate with pride.<\/p><p>I will put a few questions to the witnesses.  I was concerned to hear from the National Women's Council of Ireland about barriers that women with disabilities experience in accessing health screening services, resulting in a lower take-up of breast and cervical cancer screenings.  I would like to hear more about that in terms of any data available.<\/p><p>The incidence of violence against women with disabilities is particularly high.  That is shocking.  Perhaps the witnesses could help the committee with how we need to deal with that.<\/p><p>Equality budgeting has been expanded across government to broaden the scope to other dimensions of equality, including disability.  The initial report notes that the National Women's Council of Ireland is involved in this work.  Will the witnesses tell us a bit more about that?<\/p><p>Many disabled women gave testament to significant levels of exclusion and isolation from women's groups and the women's sector as a whole.  That was sad and there must be a way we could help support those women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#E00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":525,"content":"<p>To make a follow-up point on the comments, in our experience it has been transformative for disabled women to identify as disabled.  I highlight that because it is powerful to define oneself in the terminology that suits best.  It is most moving for us in Disabled Women Ireland to have a lot of people come forward and say they now feel comfortable identifying as disabled and they can better take up and fight for their rights now that they have this terminology.  I mention that because it is really important.<\/p> <p>  Also mentioned was the importance of women breaking down barriers for other women.  That is incredibly important.  It is important for us, as disabled women and as women, and also for everyone here to acknowledge that there are many different aspects of identity, including gender, age, whether somebody is LGBTQ, black or from a different ethnic minority, or a Traveller, Roma, transgender or from a different socioeconomic background.  I want to highlight that as disabled persons organisations and other organisations requesting support, we need to make sure we do that in a way that is inclusive of the diversity of experience that people have.  It is important that we are focusing on women with disabilities today but we need to use that as a springboard for including people with other identities and to step up and pull up people behind us as we go.<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to the involvement of disabled women in women's organisations.  We stated in our submission that this is a resource issue.  Disabled persons organisations are facing a massive resource issue.  Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta spoke about the national platform, which is the most concerning issue we have in the disabled persons organisations.<\/p><p>Access is difficult because it takes resources to make things accessible.  Sign language interpretation costs money, having a Zoom account that has closed captioning is expensive and so on.  When we go back to doing things in the physical world, more barriers will emerge again.  We have to be empathetic and compassionate and understand that there are limited resources but if there are individuals who feel they are not being included in the broader conversation, we need to see if they are being given the resources and support they need to be included.  We are all trying to do our best with the resources that we have but we should not have to make decisions and choose one or the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy Hassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to the two most recent contributions.  In terms of living locally, as a disabled feminist, it has been really difficult for me and for other disabled women in my local area to participate.  There are many reasons for this, one of which is a lack of resources.  Some people might need transport to get somewhere, even though it might be in their local area.  Personal assistants are also an issue, as are other resources like sign language interpreters.  Public buses, for example, only have room for one disabled person which causes difficulties.  If one is at bus stop number two, one might not get on because there was a disabled person at bus stop number one or a person with a pram.  These issues cause great difficulty for people.<\/p> <p>  Attitudes are also an issue.  Women are often seen as the ones who take care of disabled people and that is an attitude that we must overcome and negotiate.  In terms of data on violence against disabled women, we do not have enough.  Resources are needed for a research project to be conducted across the length and breadth of Ireland to find out where there is violence and why it is happening.  We do not really know what is happening to disabled women in very rural areas, for example.  Violence might also mean my personal assistant or carer taking away my wheelchair until he or she is ready to bring it back.  We really have to build the capacity of disabled women to identify violence.  Often disabled women are afraid that their services will be taken away if they complain but that is not acceptable any more.  I have a right to services and a right to participate in society at every level.  It is really important that disabled women at a local and national level are resourced to support themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":528,"content":"<p>We are under time pressure so we must stick rigidly to the three-minute limit.

I give them that assurance of our support and willingness to build links with them.  <\/p> <p>  We are pressed for time and I would like to hear more from the witnesses.  I have a number of questions related to specific points they have raised.  Ms Bonnie, with whom I have worked on South Dublin County Council and who is a force to be reckoned with, spoke about the need to expand the assisted human reproduction Bill to cater for disabled people.  I would love to hear a little more about what we could do, in practical terms, in that regard.  She also spoke about the low screening uptake and barriers to accessing screening, for example, the lack of hoists.  Beyond the provision of hoists, which I agree should be a basic requirement, is there anything else we could do to improve screening services for disabled people?<\/p> <p>  Ms McGovern spoke about violence, including sexual violence, against disabled women and argued that we should have some targeted initiatives to respond to and tackle that issue.  I ask her to outline her ideas on what we should be including in our frameworks going forward.  On a similar theme, Ms Hassett mentioned that not all gender-based services are accessible to people with disabilities and to disabled women in particular.  I ask her to suggest a couple of remedies that would rectify that situation and improve accessibility.  She also spoke about barriers to work.  In December 2020, this committee celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities and part of the theme we chose for that day was ability.  A number of organisations appeared before the committee to share their experience of what it is like for disabled people in the workplace.  This is an issue of which we are all cognisant and on which we really want to make an impact.  In a previous role, before I was elected as a Deputy, I worked in that area on a couple of programmes.  I tried to make sure the company I worked for was a diverse and inclusive employer that gave people of all abilities access to employment opportunities.  <\/p> <p>  The remote working strategy recently published by the T&aacute;naiste is going to be of huge benefit in terms of equipping people to ask for the opportunity to work from home.  I ask the witnesses to respond to those questions.

I am very proud to work for such a wonderful local authority.  On the question of health screening and access to same, the problem is that quantitative data have not been collected.  This is an area that must be addressed so that we really know what we are dealing with.  From a qualitative point of view, the stories I could tell the committee that I have heard from other disabled women are shocking.  Considering the number of cases that have gone through the courts already in this area of life, one would think we would be a bit more careful about including and meeting the needs of women in Ireland, regardless of their ability.<\/p> <p>  On the Bill, there are key concerns relating to a number of different heads of Bill, particularly the one related to the welfare of the child.  Judging that can be very subjective.  What does one understand by quality of life or welfare?  I had personal experience many years ago of being refused assistance unless the professional could be guaranteed that I would not have a disabled child.  That is just one example of the very broad issues that exist.  The voices of those upon whom legislation impacts need to be included in the process.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of remote working, the idea itself is not new.  The disabled community has been promoting remote working as a way of enabling people to access employment for decades but it took a global pandemic to show the world that we know what we are talking about.  If one looks at it from a wider perspective, when we talk about value for money, we need to be learning from the lived experience of the people to whom we want to deliver services.  That is the only way we can be guaranteed that we achieve value for money.  We think we are doing the right thing but we are not using lived experience to shape our decisions.

I have some very specific questions.  We spoke a little about assisted human reproduction Bill.  I am interested in the specific concerns around the review of the termination Act and its impact on women with disability or disabled women in areas such as the three-day waiting period and the possibility that a woman would have to travel twice, for example.  We have just heard how travel and public transport can be a barrier.  The restrictive gestational limits can also require travel.  What are the witnesses views on the review of the Act?<\/p> <p>  We spoke a little about autonomy and legal capacity today.  The issue is mentioned in some of the submissions to today's meeting, including the issue around parental capacity assessments.  In February, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy was before the Joint Committee on Health to examine adult safeguarding.  That is something that is playing out at the moment.

On gender-based services, including abortion, the services, laws and policies seem surprised that disabled people exist once they are commenced, despite our having fed in to the legislative process a lot, particularly around the abortion Act.  All these things are designed around the idea that whoever will present for a service will be a non-disabled, likely middle class, likely a white woman.  That is not the demographic of the people who rely on these services.  Services are shocked when someone turns up and requires a hoist or when all these barriers are put in place.  If something is designed with disability and disabled women in mind from the outset, if that approach is at the core and disabled people's voice's are consulted, the result is a system that does not just benefit disabled people but which will be more generally accessible to everyone.  It is particularly clear in the abortion Act.  We were very clear when the termination of pregnancy Bill was going through the D&aacute;il, as were Inclusion Ireland and the Disability Federation and other organisations, that the three-day wait period would create a barrier, as would strong gestational limits and that we did not know how it would interact with legal capacity and that would be a barrier.  Ultimately, the only time disability was mentioned was when it concerned potential foetal screening and selection, completely ignoring the lived reality of disabled women.  The exact same thing happened with the assisted human reproduction Act and absolutely everything that pertained to reproduction, parenting and disability.<\/p> <p>  On legal capacity and adult safeguarding, safeguarding is important but currently the system completely denies the agency and rights of disabled people and particularly disabled women.  While we need to protect everyone from abuse, the current system ignores the will and preferences of people and will ultimately always resort to substitute decision making.  The Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act is a welcome improvement but it still has a provision that can and will deny disabled people their decision-making rights.  We need to move towards the full supported decision making mechanism.  There is so much talk about choice on International Women's Day but we completely fail to recognise the intricate and invasive ways that disabled women's choices are restricted, including in this really crude legal framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>On Deputy Higgins's comments, I will ask Ms N&iacute; Fhlaratha or Ms Bonnie to respond on remedies for gender-based services as they know a great deal more than I do.

It is really important that does not become a replacement for making workplaces accessible to disabled people.  There cannot be a system where people are told they are able to work remotely so they should stay at home, so that employers do not have to worry about making workplaces accessible to use.  The same goes for educational systems.  The remote aspect of education in the last year has been problematic for disabled people but also a welcome change.  We would love to see some of that continue.  It would have opened many doors for disabled people had this come in ten years ago.  We worry a little about that.  <\/p> <p>  There has been a change to the scholarship system so that now students, such as myself, who are recipients of scholarships can still get disability allowance.

I know we all welcome the opportunity to have a public hearing from such a great array of witnesses.  It is nice for us this week to have all the witnesses before us be women.  Most of us in the Chamber are women and this committee has a majority of women members but as others have said, unfortunately, that is not the norm across the Oireachtas and the D&aacute;il still has a very low number of women Deputies, 36 Deputies which is 22.5%.  The Seanad is much better with 40%, or 24 out 60, which is a huge improvement but a long way to go.  Ireland still languishes at 101st place in world rankings of women in parliaments.  The message for International Women's Day and this week, \"nothing about us without us\", is very important for women and, as all the witnesses have said so eloquently, also for women with disabilities or disabled women.  We are very grateful to everyone for coming in and for speaking with us today and sharing such an array of experiences, and providing us with such insights into their own lived experiences and many of those they represent.<\/p> <p>  As someone who was involved in pro-choice campaigns for a long time, it was brilliant for the repeal the eighth campaign in 2018 to have so many important voices of women with disabilities or disabled women coming to the fore on the pro-repeal side.  It was most interesting to hear their thoughts on the reproductive justice side.  <\/p> <p>  My questions are on two other issues.  Do any of the witnesses have a view they wish to share with the committee on the institutionalisation of women with disabilities?  Some of the speakers have touched on how Ireland has had a shameful history of incarceration, of populations who are \"disruptive\" or seen-as disruptive to the State.  We have seen that history with mother and baby homes, Magdalen institutions and so on.  However, I am very conscious that there are complex issues around women's choices.  Last year, I worked closely with some residents in the Sisters of Charity-run home, St. Mary's home in Telford in St. Vincent's, Dublin 4.   Many here will be aware of the situation, which was very public, where the Sisters of Charity were closing the home to the great distress of many of those women within it who had known no other home.<\/p><p>The complexity of institutionalisation, which means it is not always experienced negatively by those who are institutionalised, is an issue on which I would like the witnesses to comment.<\/p><p> Finally, I have a question on the new Government policy and the great expansion of the disability remit in its move into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  What is the witnesses' view on that?  Do they see it as a positive development and how will it impact on their lives and the lives of the women they represent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#G00600","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":538,"content":"<p>The issue of institutionalisation more broadly is incredibly nuanced.  What happened to the women in the St. Mary's home is entirely not okay.  We need to be careful to bear in mind two issues in this regard.  One is ensuring that no one else enters an institution, because the system itself is very exploitative.  However, we also have to be mindful of our duty of care to those who are currently experiencing the system of institutions and the need to ensure that, as we move away from our institutional past, it is done in a way that puts their needs, will and preferences to the fore.  It is crucial that no one is forced into a position with which they are uncomfortable.  It is an incredibly difficult issue for people.  Many of the women in the system experienced institutionalisation their entire lives.  They had no idea what it was to live in a family or community and the idea of doing so at that point in their lives was impossible.  Obviously, their voices are the most important things within the system.  That was not how it played out but it is how it should have been.<\/p> <p>  That being said, we need to be very careful that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past and that no one else enters an institution.  We have to resist newer forms of institutions.  As the Senator acknowledged, we have seen many different forms of institutions in our history and in our present.  While we continue to default to the institutional model, whether that be in the form of smaller, more nicely named institutions or institutions for other groups, such as those in direct provision or in homelessness hubs, we need to be mindful that full community and independent living is the solution and the goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>We talk about institutions but there is also the issue of young disabled people being involuntarily incarcerated in homes for older people because they have not been given access to the necessary personal assistance hours or accessible housing.

This meeting in itself is hugely important as a means of recognising the importance of a gender perspective on disability and understanding how the real inequalities for disabled women affect their daily life.  There is a specific piece of work to be done in this regard and actions certainly are long overdue.  It is great to get a real insight and perspective from the witnesses on these matters.<\/p> <p>  I find it deeply worrying and concerning that women with disabilities in Ireland are more likely to experience violence, as we have talked about here today, and that a significant proportion of gender-based services in Ireland are not accessible to disabled women.  I find it hard to believe in this day and age that such services are not disability-proofed.  More important is the question of how we address that issue.  Many of these services are struggling from year to year on the funding they get.  I wonder whether it is specifically and only about funding.  It is not an excuse but, in reality, if that is the issue, then we need to demand that services are funded sufficiently to ensure they are disability-proofed.  Do any of the witnesses have knowledge of what service providers are saying in that respect?  Is the funding aspect the largest barrier or is there something else in tandem such as training elements that are missing and required for staff?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  The lack of access to transport is something on which I would like to focus.  In my constituency of Clare, many people with disabilities who live in rural areas have relied on a service that was provided by Clare Accessible Transport whereby the disabled person could telephone to request to be picked up at a specific location.  Unfortunately, the service was lost last year as the Covid crisis hit.  I am seeking further information from the Minister for Transport on the matter and as to whether accessibility clauses should be included in tendering processes.  The important point I want to make is that sometimes when services are in place and working well, they are, unfortunately, cut or replaced.  That is not good enough.  Do the witnesses consider that these issues are occurring because people, particularly women, are an afterthought in the bigger plans for transport?  Do they think the Minister needs to be more hands-on in this regard or is it an issue with tendering processes and making sure that accessibility clauses are included?<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their contributions regarding the institutionalisation of women.  A number of people in Clare aged under 65 are in nursing homes.  The witnesses have responded on the broader issue but is there something that can be done about those people who are in nursing homes at the present time to facilitate their move into a more residential setting or whatever option they would choose for themselves?<\/p> <p>  As we are under a time constraint, I will conclude by asking the opinion of the witnesses on the State's initial draft report on the implementation of the UNCRPD and how it can be improved to ensure account is taken of the rights of women with disabilities.  I finish by noting the words of Maya Angelou: \"[W]e may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#H00400","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I will make just a few brief points because the other witnesses are greater experts than I in these areas.  In speaking with our membership and getting feedback on the draft State report, which we have been doing over the past week or two, the first point I would make is that there are massive concerns around things that are missing and absent and also about the way certain things are presented and whether it reflects the lived experience of disabled people.  Shadow reports will be written, in which process we will participate.  We certainly have concerns in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that women are an afterthought in transport considerations.  This is a global problem.  It is known in every single aspect of transport that women are not considered.  In terms of designing transport for cities, the focus on people working in full-time paid jobs is an example of this.<\/p><p>They tend to be more male based.  They tend to make transport trips in and out of the city whereas women make more lateral movements around cities.  The majority of transport systems, at least in Dublin, are focused on getting in and out of the city.  That is the exact same for disabled women in that it is an afterthought.<\/p><p> With regard to support services for women, one comment made by our membership is that the physical services are not accessible but also the lack of disability understanding training for staff is a massive concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy Hassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Ms McGovern wants to come in but we will move on to the next speaker.

The one thing all of us on this committee have to make sure we do is to listen and make policies to help.  That is our mission.  It is something we need to do.<\/p> <p>  I wish everyone a happy International Women's Week.  It is important.  The first thing that hit me when I read the statements was the violence against disabled women.  We need to ask Tusla to provide a categorised database to show disabled women's experience.  Funding has a major part to play in that but we need to do that because it is very important.<\/p> <p>  When we speak about political life we must highlight that there are not enough representatives in elected office.  What can we do to encourage that and engage more?  One of the witnesses might come back to me on that.<\/p> <p>  All of us are hearing about BreastCheck and CervicalCheck.  It is very important that disabled women do not have to ask for supports such as a hoist.  It should be standard.  Working with the HSE it is very important that there is communication and information.  That should be available.  We do not want women to say that was not available to them and describe how bad they felt.  That is something on which we need to work.  Those are issues we need to address.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the absence of disabled voices.  We need to include all voices and listen, particularly to what women are saying, but I was sad to hear Ms McGovern say that when people are not listening it can affect mental health.  She might come back to me on mental health and the way that has impacted the witnesses.  I know it has been hard but Covid-19 in particular has been extremely hard on people's mental health.  The witnesses might come back to me on that.<\/p> <p>  When we are launching programmes we need to get more women involved.  It is very important that with policies and us working as two different groups we learn and make sure that we deliver on policies that will affect women. <\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe it would be helpful to have a disabled person at the decision making level in all local government?  I believe that will be very important and it is something we need to examine.  I was a councillor before I became a Senator and a Deputy and whether it was working through local grants, housing adaptation grants or whatever grants were available, it was payments being means tested.  That was brought up today and I would be very worried about that.  No payments should be means tested.  That is an issue we need to address.<\/p> <p>  One of the statements that summed everything up was that disabled women can fully realise their social, cultural, political and economic rights.  That is what we have to do here.  All of us have a duty of care and it is something on which I believe we need to deliver.  I again thank the witnesses.  The meeting, and the presentations, were excellent.  They might come back to me with some answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#J00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Murnane O'Connor.

I will give the members a mishmash because I am hearing lots of stuff.  I would love to be among them having a cup of tea and a chat because the lived experience of disabled women is very important.<\/p> <p>  On the question of institutionalisation, please do not forget the disabled women who were institutionalised in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  I was one of those women.  I was institutionalised for 12 years and it was very difficult to come into an open society.  We need to look after those women also.<\/p> <p>  I would welcome the idea of disabled people being on every single board but it is very important that resources are put in because it is all about money.  We live in a society that rejects us so we need to ensure that funding is put in place.<\/p> <p>  With regard to mental health, because of attitudinal reasons and our built environment it was very difficult for me as a disabled woman, and for other disabled women, to participate fully in any part of society.  When one cannot participate perhaps due to access or attitudinal reasons, lack of resources or whatever the issue might be, that comes back on one like a mirror.  I felt that I was really not wanted in my society and when that is coming back to one all the time, that is difficult to deal with at times.  It is about ensuring that we build an environment that is fully accessible to every single person within our land.  That is important.  Universal access is very important.<\/p> <p>  I will make one more point around hoists.  I experienced this issue quite recently.  I was looking for a hoist to attend an appointment.  Although I had telephoned the hospital to say that I needed a hoist there was no hoist to meet me.  I had to leave the hospital to get another appointment when a hoist was available.  I should not have to do that.  No disabled woman should have to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":547,"content":"<p>We will now go to Senator Mary Seery Kearney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#J00600","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses very much.  I am very taken by Ms McGovern's contribution.  I come from a background of being a privacy lawyer.  One of the aspects of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, was privacy by design; everything has to be privacy by design.  What I am taking from this morning's meeting is that we should have ability by design.  Everything we do should consider the limitations in how we are providing a service, how we can overcome those limitations and make sure we have people advising who experience the limitations and are in a position to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses for their contributions and wish all of them a very happy International Women's Week.  I am the Fine Gael spokesperson on disability and I must confess that I have taken the witnesses' opening statements as a to-do list.  I would welcome further engagement on that outside of this meeting by way of follow-up.<\/p> <p>  To give the witnesses a brief outline of my actions as I have been sitting here listening to them and having read their statements in preparation for today's meeting, I noted that clarification was required from the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on the provisions, the cards and the additional points the witnesses made.  I have sent a request to her office.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, for International Women's Day, I raised a Commencement matter in the Seanad on intimate partner violence and the increasing rates of domestic violence because all the January reports show that.  The Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, stated in reply that they were currently conducting an audit of the services and that included an assurance of diversity in the provision of domestic violence supports.  My focus, I confess, was very much on trans and non-binary women.  I have been thinking that it did not occur to me to specifically ask about disability.  As I was sitting here, I emailed the Minister for Justice asking whether she has engaged on this and saying that, if not, she needs to engage directly with those people who are contributing and speaking so passionately this morning.  I asked her to make sure that she hears their perspectives.  Rather than me representing the witnesses they should get to speak for themselves.<\/p> <p>  My home constituency is Dublin South Central so I am particularly taken by Ms McGovern's statement that Ballyfermot-Chapelizod has the highest proportion of people with disabilities living in an urban setting.  I would like to hear more on that.<\/p> <p>  I have been advocating with various Ministers in various forms on hidden disabilities and the lack of provision for that also.  I have particularly advocated on the shortcomings in the primary medical certificate, the criteria for entitlement to that and what flows from that with regard to disabled drivers, disabled passengers and how there is a limitation in that respect.  One particular advocate, Gr&aacute;inne Leach, whom I know personally is on to me regularly.  I see one of the witnesses nodding.  Gr&aacute;inne sent me an email this morning saying she had already been on to them to make sure that her position was outlined.  She is without one of her arms but does not qualify under the criteria, yet lives a life that is very limiting and does not have access to any funding that flows from that.<\/p><p> My statement for International Women's Day yesterday in the Seanad was dedicated to the draft assisted human reproduction Bill.  I am a member of the AHR coalition.  I see significant shortcomings in and have concerns around the draft Bill and I raised a number of them yesterday.  Among these are making sure that persons with a disability have a say in influencing and making sure that the provisions within the Bill also meet their needs because there are other groups where they do not.  I would welcome hearing more from Ms Bonnie and engaging with her; if Ms Bonnie is not already in the coalition, I urge her to make that contact.  I would be happy to do that.<\/p><p> Lastly, I was taken by the reference to \"institutions\".  We have a picture in our head of what that looks like, but what we do not have and what did not come home to me was the fact that one's own home can be an institution in how one is treated within it.  I have had much engagement with Colin McAndrew of Global Citizens.  Mr. McAndrew talks about the urban built environment and the experience and accessibility within that.  I would welcome hearing more about what we could do, how we can assist and how, as legislators, we should respond.<\/p><p> Apologies, there was a great deal there.

I would echo what the Chair said.  There are so many questions and so many issues arising that it would be good if we could even get written input on some of them because we are going theme by theme.  I would welcome that kind of nuanced expertise and experience around the issues of means testing and how it could be removed, and how the costs of disability should be better recognised.  I was struck by the fact that employment opportunities are not only double-glazed but sometimes triple glazed.  On the transfer into remote working, how do we ensure that it is empowering and how do we completely overhaul the approach to reasonable accommodation that we have at present?  I would welcome written input on those issues.  I am signalling those points because I have many questions as well.<\/p> <p>  We came into this session knowing that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities mandated us as a committee to ask how our approach to disability can be gender proofed but what has come across so strongly from the presentations is that our supports for women in Ireland also need to be disability proofed.<\/p> <p>  I was stuck by what Ms McGovern said about violence.  Something I care a lot about is coercive control, which was brought in by the Seanad as an offence.  I was wondering about the other more insidious and financial abuse of women with a disability, if Ms McGovern wanted to comment on that, and how we could understand or communicate that better.  I am also struck by the fact that this can happen in the home and that idea that the home can be an institution, and even a place of institutional abuse.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the choice in living issue, Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta already gave a nuanced piece so that we do not have a blunt tool that is only about the numbers in a building but that looks to how we ensure there is choice around how people are living, be it with a community of like-minded people, with friends, with family or alone.  Will Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta comment further around the issue of personal assistants and the difference, for example, between care supports and personal assistants in terms of empowering people in making those choices, empowering people around cultural and political participation, and particularly around empowering people within their family relationships to have more equal family relationships and that fuller relationship piece?<\/p> <p>  This brings me to what Ms Bonnie was talking about, which I am really interested in and which others have talked around.  I will be bringing Ms Bonnie's points back to the reproductive rights group in the Oireachtas because they are really important.  Could Ms Bonnie expand further around parental capacity assessments because I have some concern around the way those are applied to women with a disability?<\/p> <p>  Statistics have been talked about.  Any written input is great, but how could our consultations be better designed so that we get input from people?  That means thinking about the web accessibility directive but maybe also designing consultations in a better way.<\/p> <p>  Returning to Ms McGovern on the community level, I refer to that aspect of shaping communities.  How do we ensure that it is not only about community supports but about supporting women to shape their communities and culturally participate in them?  I am concerned that in the last recession we saw that community supports were really caught.  Everything was directed towards jobs and nothing else.  How important is it that we build up our community infrastructure from the perspective of women with a disability?<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for everything.

First of all, I included my contact details at the back of my statement.  If anybody wants to engage with me after this morning about any of the issues, he or she is welcome to contact me.<\/p> <p>  On parental assessments, what has come to the fore is that mothers with a disability are being set up to fail by the way the system is currently designed and much work needs to be done there.  Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta might be able to speak further on that.<\/p> <p>  Briefly, the difference between a personal assistance service and a carer is that with a personal assistance service, the person with a disability is the boss.  We lead our personal assistant, PA, and the PA works to our direction to do things at the time we choose in the way that we choose whereas with a carer, one does not have that choice and control.<\/p> <p>  One final point relates to something a few previous speakers raised.  On ensuring that services are accessible, under Part III of the Disability Act 2005, each public agency should have an appointed access officer.  Perhaps it is time for the new Department to engage with and maybe develop a register of all those access officers because I can guarantee there are many agencies that should have them that have not appointed them.  The Department should then engage with the individual access officers across the country to encourage them to make their services accessible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Selina Bonnie"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>We have Ms McGovern and Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta offering.

The way that each one of the witnesses presented to us is truly what this committee is about.  We have to listen but we also have to take on board what people say.<\/p> <p>  I have probably 100 questions.  Therefore, I will not ask any questions but I will make some comments.  First of all, within the D&aacute;il we talk about legislation.<\/p><p>I believe that only one current Oireachtas Member is a person with a disability.  That is something we need to change.  How do we change it?  This committee, with the organisations represented today, has to make sure we make disabilities a very political issue and we need to get people involved in it.<\/p><p> The fact I am a lone ranger sitting here this morning does not discomfort me in any way.  To listen to what the witnesses have to say is very important.  A number of issues that have arisen during Covid have highlighted the lack of services and the lack of engagement we have had, be it in regard to special needs education or the way primary medical certificates are dealt with at the moment, where assessments are non-existent, and there does not seem to be a way of getting these things done.  I like the idea of having access officers within each organisation, and that they do the job they are supposed to be doing and it is not just tokenism, which I sometimes feel these kinds of things can be.<\/p><p> There is a huge body of issues that we have to sort out and we should tackle them one at a time.  When my students were doing a big project in class, I would ask them how we eat an elephant, and the answer was that we take it one bite at a time.  Today is the one bite at a time that we are all here for.  I reassure the witnesses that this committee, since it was set up, has been very much involved in doing things rather than talking about things.  There are a lot of things that we need to change, with the help of the organisations here today, and maybe they will lead us in that change.  That is what I am offering.  As women but also as people who are living with disabilities, their experience is more important than any report I would get from anybody else.  What I have heard this morning is just the tip of the iceberg.  I look forward to engaging with the witnesses again, whether at the committee or aside from the committee, and I may contact them.  Given all the questions that were asked, we could do with a full week to get the answers.  We need to make sure that we gain as much information as possible from the witnesses on the issues they have.<\/p><p> I have encountered the issue of means testing and disability supports when people are trying to get a job or trying to improve themselves in my constituency in Galway.  People have contacted me when they have an opportunity because, if they go for it, they will lose their disability allowance or something to this effect, which is shambolic given what we are trying to do.<\/p><p> The witnesses are all very brave people but they should never feel they are alone.  There is a great committee here to help them.  We have attitudes to change and we have to do that with education.  We have to make sure that every policy is disability-proofed in every Department.  It will take time to do that but a change of attitude is the start of it.  I have no questions.  I wish all of the witnesses well this week, international women's week.  It is important that it is not just about this week and then putting that back up on the shelf again.  We have taken it down and we need to make sure we fix it before we put it back up again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#K00900","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I invite Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#L00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I will try to wrap up a few issues.  On representation, there are 220 Oireachtas Members.  The Deputy can tell me there is only one disabled person but I do not believe him.  We comprise 13.5% to 25% of the population, depending on what metric is used, so there are more of them here.<\/p> <p>  In terms of participation, many very creative solutions are being proposed today but the greatest one that will work is properly resourcing, supporting and engaging with disabled persons' organisations.  In preparing for today, six people helped to write the submission that Ms Hassett and I made earlier, and 12 other people fed into it.  We all have very different disabilities and we come from different areas, and we are able to identify the barriers on that basis.  That is where our expertise comes from.  That is probably the single most effective way to facilitate participation of disabled people in the political process.<\/p> <p>  In terms of primary medical certificates and supports, Ms Bonnie did a very good job of detailing why personal assistant, PA, support was different because it kept the person concerned in charge - because it gives agency and autonomy.  We also probably need that rights focus in approaching other areas of disability support, and that includes primary medical certificates.  What primary medical certificates do is they say that if someone's body fits in the box exactly, they need this support and that support.  However, none of our bodies fit in any box exactly.  When we are assessing services, it needs to be directed by the disabled person in voicing what they need and what supports they need, and they should be supported from that basis.  No tick-box exercise is going to say exactly what I need, what Ms McGovern needs, what Ms Hassett needs or what Ms Bonnie needs.<\/p> <p>  In terms of parental capacity assessments, I will try to be brief and try not to be angry.  In a world where we are currently focusing on people being forced to be apart from their children for completely unreasonable things, parental capacity assessments are a tick-box exercise designed to separate disabled people from their children because we do not trust disabled people to be parents.  That is simply it.  We do not have a way to say there is no risk and because we inherently see disabled people as a risk, and we do not actually provide people with the support to parent; that is all parental capacity assessments can see.  To everyone who is a parent on the committee, I guarantee they would fail this.  We do not ask any other parents, when their child is born, how to raise a teenager.  We need to stop looking at disabled parents as a danger and start seeing what measures we can have to support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I feel blown away and emotional following all of the contributions, which have highlighted why this committee is so important and how it can make issues visible.  Visibility is the problem.  For too long, the needs of people with difference in this country have been invisible.  I have learned so much from all the witnesses this morning.  I feel incredibly hurt and have been upset by some of the comments because of the impact on our guests' basic human rights to be parents, to be women, to have reproductive rights, to have sexual rights and to be who they are.  The theme of today's meeting was equality and equity.  The equity part is really important to me because it is about recognising difference, recognising difference in us all, and appreciating and celebrating differences but putting things in place that make those differences null and void and makes us all achieve what we need to achieve.<\/p> <p>  Many really good questions have been asked and I will not go back over them but I do not believe the disability allowance issues have been dealt with.  There is clearly a huge issue in the system when 42% of applications are disallowed but 70% of those are granted on appeal.  Why are the applications granted after initially being disallowed?  To me, turning down applications proves that there is a serious lack of procedure and that people are not being listened to.  There is always a margin for error but 70% is a huge error.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their contributions as I have gained so much from them.

I could give a long reply but I will not.  First, we could have a really involved conversation about the disability allowance.  I encourage the committee to engage with us because we have spoken about the allowance a lot recently.  Indeed, the fact that 70% of the appeals go through turns my stomach.  I am one of these people who has been turned down twice for the allowance.  I was successful once on appeal and unsuccessful the second time but for the same reason that Catherine Gallagher has experienced problems.  What I can tell the committee from my own experience is that the application process does not capture the lived experience of disability.  I could give the committee ten more points about the allowance but will simply encourage members to engage with us because we can provide them with systematic analysis on the vagaries of that system.<\/p> <p>  As we emerge from Covid, we are, if we are being realistic, about to go into an economic downturn.  I want to highlight that to members because those who suffer the most in economic downturns are women and disabled people, plus other individuals of minority backgrounds across the spectrum, but particularly disabled women given the topic of today's debate.  We would be really happy to engage with the many different members of this committee who have asked us to on various different issues because we can give more information.  The means testing of payments is a significant concern for us.<\/p> <p>  In terms of representation in public office, in the UK there are specific funding resources for disabled candidates when they run for public office but that does not happen here.  That is a major barrier but it is a minor change that we could make.  Indeed, there is a lot more that needs to be done regarding this issue.<\/p> <p>  On engaging people in local government, I would caution for and against having a single disabled person because it is absolutely impossible for any one disabled person to represent the views of all disabled people and experiences are so diverse.  For me, as a physically disabled person, it is very difficult to explain what it is like to be neurodiverse or know what reasonable accommodations are appropriate.  <\/p> <p>  My final point is on mental health.  Disabled people have found the pandemic incredibly difficult.  We were the first to go into quarantine and we will be the last to emerge.  In our opening statement, we mentioned our Disabled is not a Dirty Word campaign.  We ran the campaign because we have been absolutely horrified and heartbroken by the language that is being used about disabled people such as that Covid is not dangerous if one does not have an underlying condition or Covid only affects people who have an underlying condition or are disabled.  I wish to point out that Covid will make people disabled.  Covid has disproportionately affected people who are disabled.  We also know that Covid has killed a disproportionate number of disabled people.  So, in terms of mental health, we stress that the mental health system must be overhauled.  I urge the committee to please bear in mind that mental health issues are a massive problem, issue and concern for disabled people, particularly disabled women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021030900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy Hassett"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":569,"content":"<p>A whole raft of areas have been covered by members.

Up to 7 March, a total of 223,219 cases and 4,422 deaths due to Covid-19 have been recorded in Ireland.  Our 14-day incidence rate is now 172.3 per 100,000, down from almost 1,500 in the middle of January.<\/p> <p>  We are still actively managing 358 outbreaks in acute hospitals and long-term residential care settings, although the number of new outbreaks is falling.  As of today, I will give the updated numbers from my script, we now have 397 people with Covid-19 in hospital and 101 people receiving ICU care.<\/p><p>While falling, these numbers are still very high in the context of our experience with this disease and in comparison with other health conditions.  This has an ongoing impact on our acute and community services which are simultaneously responding to usual seasonal pressures and maintaining as many services as possible, accounting for social distancing measures and infection prevention and control, IPC, requirements.<\/p><p> Thankfully, our winter plan initiatives, such as GP access to diagnostics and additional home care hours, are successfully mitigating demand on hospital services.  We are restarting paused services on an incremental basis and hope to be in a position to restart all services shortly.  However, it must be understood that our staff are still in the midst of responding to the unprecedented Covid-19 surge, from which the recovery will be much more gradual than the escalation.<\/p><p> On testing and tracing, the third Covid-19 surge placed unprecedented pressure on our test and trace system, with an increase in demand that has been well-documented.  Referrals for testing peaked at 28,000 per day in late December 2020.  Extensive operational planning and demand modelling was undertaken in advance of this period which allowed the agile deployment of many levers and service reconfigurations to cope with prolonged demand.  The decision to reduce close contact testing allowed all testing resources to be directed to finding new cases from symptomatic individuals.  Close contact testing resumed on 29 January.  Retrospective contact tracing is occurring and will increase as case numbers reduce to under 600 consistently.  While testing volumes remain high, current metrics across the test and trace system show that we are operating within target performance levels.  The HSE antigen working group is validating a range of antigen assays, including in acute hospitals, the meat processing sector, community testing sites and outbreak settings.  Antigen testing is now available to all acute hospitals and is being used by three National Ambulance Service mobile teams on a pilot basis.  These will be used as a tool alongside our extensive PCR rapid and batch testing systems.<\/p><p> On vaccinations, since the roll-out of the vaccination programme began on 29 December 2020, significant achievements have been made by the HSE.  As of 5 March, 363,601 first-dose vaccines and 149,721 second-dose vaccines - a total of 513,322 - have been administered.  We will get updated figures this morning.  I am delighted to report that residents in long-term residential care facilities, front-line healthcare workers, and people over 85 years of age have largely received their first dose, and in many cases, their second dose.<\/p><p> We are continually adjusting our integrated operational plans to align with the updated allocation sequencing and confirmation of supply schedules.  Despite many challenges, the HSE has adhered to the Government&rsquo;s principle of ensuring all available vaccine supply is administered.  We are currently among the top five countries in the EU for vaccine roll-out.<\/p><p> Clinical oversight and guidance are at the centre of directing the roll-out of the vaccination programme to ensure vaccines can be administered safely, efficiently and effectively.  We continue to build the appropriate capacity to administer 250,000 vaccines per week, subject to supply.  Our ongoing planning and roll-out includes operating models for GPs, pharmacies and vaccination centres, alongside the corresponding ICT, infrastructure and recruitment mobilisation.  Some 37 HSE vaccination centres have been agreed and the required infrastructure is being finalised, with self-referral processes planned.  To date, over 2,000 recruitment applications have been received and an additional 9,702 healthcare professionals have completed Covid-19 vaccination training.<\/p><p> In conclusion, we are coming out of a very challenging period, although we are not out of the woods yet.  While we know it has been extremely difficult for everyone, we are asking the public to stick with us over the coming weeks and continue to follow the public health guidance to help suppress the spread of the virus.  The virus and its impact on society remain largely unpredictable and, as such, the need for proactive monitoring and agile planning has always been a feature of our response, and will continue to be so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":579,"content":"<p>As members are also attending the meeting virtually from their offices, they cannot see the clock to monitor speaking time.

The first two will hopefully only require short replies, so I might start with them.  Have all GPs nationwide received at least their first batch of vaccines that were issued up to last week?  Second, last week at the meeting of the committee, I raised with the Minister for Health the case of patients in hospital settings who have not received the first dose of the vaccine, as the policy of the HSE was that vaccinations should take place in the community only.  Can Mr. Reid confirm that this policy has now changed and that hospital patients over the age of 70 will now receive the first dose in hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#B00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I will be brief in my responses.  On the question in respect of GPs, we are engaged with a total of over 1,300 practices throughout the country.  The vast majority of them have received and, indeed, administered first doses to 72,500 people in this age population.  The remaining supplies will be sent this week to 30 GP surgeries which are not in a position to buddy up for various understandable reasons.  They cover a population of between 500 and 750 in total.  That group will be vaccinated this week.  The surgeries will receive their supplies during the course of the week.  Our contact centre has been contacting them from last Friday and contact will be made to confirm deliveries for the rest of this week.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's second point, he is quite right that there are other people in that age population that need to be vaccinated during the course of this week.  That group includes people who are housebound.  An arrangement has been put in place in agreement with GPs and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, for them to be vaccinated by the National Ambulance Service.  Third, arrangements are being put in place to vaccinate those who are hospitalised in one of our acute hospitals.  It is a tricky issue because there may be some patients who are in hospital for a very short period, so arrangements need to be made in respect of where they will receive their second dose.  However, our leaning now is that if people are in hospital, they will be vaccinated there and will most likely also receive their second dose in hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I welcome the change in policy from last week when the Minister attended the committee.  It is certainly welcome in respect of those who are resident in our hospitals.<\/p> <p>  In April, it is hoped that we will receive around 250,000 doses per week.  That is the estimate, all being well, and it amounts to 1 million doses for the month.  We want those doses to be administered.  I ask Mr. Reid to talk us through procedurally how this number of vaccines will be administered in our vaccination centres, GP surgeries, pharmacies and even dental surgeries.  For example, will it be first come, first served in the relevant age groups or will people be individually invited to receive the vaccine or book online?  What sort of logistics does the HSE have planned for that?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns interns and the intern doctor cohort.  There are currently around 1,100 interns working in the HSE.  From 12 July 2021, this number will drop to 750.  In effect, the health service will be cutting about 250 junior doctor posts, arguably at a time of huge demand for resources.  To put it into context, in University Hospital Galway, intern numbers will fall from 86 to 71; in Portiuncula Hospital, they will fall from 15 to 11; and in Mayo University Hospital, they will fall from 16 to 11.  Last year, the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, offered all eligible graduates of Irish medical schools an internship role with the HSE.  Considering that there is an even larger budget this year, why is that policy not being continued?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#B00500","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I will take the first two questions, before asking my colleague, Dr. Colm Henry, to respond to the Senator's third question.  I am conscious of the time limit, so I will be brief.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly walk the committee through the logistics and the sequencing of the delivery of 250,000 vaccines per week in April, as referred to by the Senator.  Put simply, there are plans in place for 37 vaccination centres to open immediately across the country.  There will be a total of approximately 800 booths across those vaccination centres.  The centres will range in size and will have the capacity to complete different levels of vaccination throughout the country.  Some will have 50 booths, some will have between 30 and 50, some will have between one and 20 and others will have between 20 and 30.  They will be of various sizes and scale.  The centres with 50 booths will administer approximately 5,000 vaccinations per day, with the figure reducing to 3,000, 2,000 or 1,000 based on scale and size.  The resourcing plans for the centres are ongoing.<\/p><p>There are three different strands to it.  There are now almost 10,000 vaccinators on our register of trained vaccinators throughout the country, being a combination of HSE staff, other healthcare staff and professionals.  Our GPs and pharmacists are key as well and they will obviously be part of the vaccination programme.  Separate to that, the local community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and hospital groups have initiated their own recruitment campaigns and have progressed very well with recruitment for their vaccination centres.  Separate to that again, we have advertised through a national campaign and we have close to 2,200 applicants today, almost 1,100 of whom have already been screened.  All have very strong qualifications and many are already Garda vetted and ready to go.  That is the resourcing model approach to the vaccination centres.<\/p><p> Vaccination centres will operate on a 12-hour day basis.  That does not mean that vaccinators will be working and on their feet for 12 hours.  Rather, they will be working on a rotational shift basis.  We have determined the resourcing requirement to be approximately 25 staff for every ten booths.  Obviously, there will be a requirement for ten vaccinators for ten booths but other administrative staff will also be needed.  We have seen six of these vaccination centres in operation throughout the country, including in Galway, Sligo and Dublin, which has given us a real indication of how they work and the processes involved.  That is the resourcing model for the vaccination centres.<\/p><p> In terms of how people will be sequenced to come in to the centres, on a national level we are working towards the national prioritisation programme set out by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, and the sequencing agreed by Government.  The group we are working on at the moment is quite a challenging one.  Cohort 4 comprises those with medical conditions that put them at high or very high risk.  We are working through the process of determining the best locations for them to have their vaccinations.  We envisage it will be a combination of hospitals, vaccination centres and GP surgeries.  As we move into the wider population in April, the vaccination sequencing will be supported by an ICT portal.  As we move into the next category of prioritisation, we will be advising the relevant people to register on the portal and they will be assigned an appropriate location for their vaccine.  Ultimately, as we move into those larger groups in April, it will be a combination of GP surgeries, pharmacies and vaccination centres in their entirety.  That is a very quick overview of the situation with regard to the centres, the sequencing, the who and the when.  I will ask my colleague, Dr. Henry, to respond to the Senator's question on medical interns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his question.  Normally there are 734 intern posts created as part of our structured intern training scheme which feeds into our basic specialist training, higher specialist training and so on.  Last year, as a once-off, we offered in excess of 1,100 posts because of the prevailing conditions.  We were in the middle of the first surge.  The interns started early, on 25 May, rather than in early July and that overlap was particularly welcomed by the intern networks and the junior doctors themselves.  It was always understood that this was a once-off situation.<\/p> <p>  The figure is set at 734 because that number of places corresponds to other important interdependent numbers, one of which is the number of CAO applicants for medicine and the number of training places available for doctors who come off the intern year, which is a year they must complete before they get full registration.  Basic specialty training comes after intern year, then higher specialist training and, ultimately, consultant posts.  What we are trying to do is create more posts at senior level so there is proper medical manpower planning and a corresponding number of interns produced by our medical schools.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the numbers and any future expansion, work is ongoing in the HSE by the national doctors training and planning unit on the modernisation of the intern year project, involving all of the 734 posts.  One stream of this project involves looking at the numbers of posts, the number of training positions for people after they come off intern schemes and how they will ultimately lead to GP or consultant posts as part of proper, all-round manpower planning.

On the first issue, it must be borne in mind that in the UK a decision was made to extend the interval between the first and second doses of the vaccine and that may have informed any decision made to administer a booster dose.  In addition, HIQA has surveyed the question of immunity, whether natural or vaccine-induced, and there is evidence of persistent antibodies up to six months, with some waning thereafter.  The question of a booster dose is one that is outstanding for all countries internationally and it has not been answered yet.  We may well be looking at annual booster doses, depending on what the evidence shows in time.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that there is not a single national disease registry for the whole range of conditions described by NIAC in its letter.  It is easier to identify patients with certain conditions.  For example, the national renal office has a good idea of the number of people on dialysis, those who have received organ transplantation and those in the end stages of renal failure through the network of nephrologists.  Similarly, in the area of cancer the oncology network will have a fairly good idea of the types of patients described in the NIAC document.

There have been reports about the vaccination programme, and this process has been frustrating for everybody, with peaks and troughs.  Mr. Reid will appreciate that several anticipated game changers to date have fallen short.  The latest good news story relates to an anticipated game changer, namely, the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson one-shot vaccine and its potential.  There was an anticipated supply of about 50 million doses of that vaccine in the United States, but in the short term I think that figure has fallen to 10 million doses because of issues encountered by the subcontractor who produces the vials for the vaccine.  It is not an issue with the production of the vaccine but with the production of the vials.  The expectation being talked about now in the US is of 10 million doses being available in the short term.  What news has there been from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson?  The European Medicines Agency, EMA, still has to approve this vaccine.

I thank him and his colleagues for their ongoing work.  I have a number of questions which will require short answers.<\/p> <p>  I refer to data generally.  I appeal to Mr. Reid to provide more figures on a regular basis.  It is difficult because every week health spokespersons need to ask the Minister for information, and we repeat the requests here.  I will preface my remarks by saying that everybody understands that there are supply issues and the supply is volatile, but it is important that we get data on the factual situation.  I am talking about the actual number of deliveries that have arrived here.  I am not looking for forecasts or projections, but rather the actual figures.<\/p> <p>  We now have daily figures for the number of vaccines.  We have sought daily figures for the number of vaccines that arrive in this country.  The Minister agreed last week that there would be weekly updates on the number of vaccines that arrive in this country.  I want to check with Mr. Reid whether those weekly figures will be available on the data hub and that we will not have to plead for them to be made available?  They should be published daily, or at least weekly as a start.  I ask Mr. Reid to clarify that will be the case.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to Moderna.  The official figures as of the end of February state 40,800 doses of Moderna have arrived in this country.  As of 28 February, the official figures state that 8,630 doses were administered.  What is the reason for the very substantial gap between the number of vaccines that have arrived and the number administered?<\/p> <p>  On messaging and what the HSE is intending to do, it is important that it is a bit more specific because my concern is that people's expectations are being raised by the kind of general messaging that is going on.  For example, three weeks ago it was announced that all those aged over 70 would receive the vaccine and that that task was starting.  It was not made clear to people that there were sub-categories within that.  We are now just getting to the point of finishing the over-85 cohort.  It will be a few weeks before people in their early 70s are vaccinated.  It would be better if we were told the HSE was starting with those aged over 85 and then moving onto those aged between 80 and 85.  It would give people some idea of when they could expect to get their vaccines.<\/p> <p>  The point applies to cohort 4, people at very high risk.  My understanding is that there are about 160,000 people in that category.  It has been stated that this week 10,000 will be vaccinated.  It will be some time before everybody in that category is done.  The message should be clearer in regard to the period of time involved in vaccinating that cohort. <\/p> <p>  I have a question on the plan for the mass vaccination programme.  At the moment the average daily number of vaccines being administered is 12,500.  If we are to use the full expected supply for the second quarter, that will have to be ramped up to about 40,000 per day, which is a massive increase.   Mr. Reid gave various figures earlier in response to the first questioner.  Does the HSE intend to publish the plan for the mass vaccination programme?  We know there are 37 centres, and have talked about 10,000 people being trained and 2,200 being recruited.  When will we actually see the plan?<\/p><p>When is it intended to publish it?  <\/p><p> My final question relates to tracing.  What percentage of people are being back-traced seven or 14 days to find out where the virus is being transmitted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#F02300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1615248000,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions and comments.

All of the data that we have from testing and tracing and the vaccination programme are being recorded in the same data lake and so we will be in a stronger position to produce more data as we go along.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was in regard to an update on the Moderna vaccine, the delivery schedule and the difference between the gap.  I will make two points.  I am working off the top of my head but I think the last delivery up to last week was about 42,500.  Of that, 1,800 were used for GPs for the initial vaccination programme, which equates to 3,600 in terms of two doses.  A further 12,500 were immediately distributed to GPs to help them with some of the more difficult clients they had to get to.  They will be utilising that supply.  The difference between the Moderna vaccine and the others is that we have to keep a one-for-one distribution in the fridge in our central cold chain storage.  For every one we distribute for vaccination, we have to keep a second.  That is based on supplier recommendations and guidelines.  It is different because of the buffer in any given week.  By way of description, a buffer in any given week is a combination of the Pfizer-BioNtech supply that we propose to use for vaccination the following week and whatever distribution we have given out in total for Moderna to be vaccinated.  It is slightly different; it is an extra requirement to be held back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I appreciate that but the figures as of the end of February show that less than one-quarter of the Moderna supply had been administered.

A further 6,000 were distributed last week to GPs and that requires another 6,000 to be held back in the fridge.  The Moderna vaccines will be administered through GPs, working through the 80 to 84 year olds.<\/p> <p>  On the question around messaging for the over 70 and 85 year olds, the Deputy is correct that we are aiming to get through first vaccination of all of the over 70s before the middle of April, with the second vaccination to be completed before the middle of May.  We have started doing that on an incremental basis.  I fully accept what the Deputy says in terms of expectation.  We have gone out fairly regularly and announced what group we were doing next and what numbers were in each group.  The figure for the 85 to 90 age group was 72,500.  The figure for the group we are progressing through now, which is the 80 to 84 year olds, is 90,000.  We know there are 72,500 in the 85 plus age group and we have probably done over 96,000 of those aged 70 and over.  GPs are administering some vaccines to the 80 to 85 year olds this week, as they did for some in the previous week, but in the case of a person in the 80 to 84 year old category whose husband, wife or partner is, for example, 87 years old where there are potential extra doses available they have the facility to vaccinate in parallel.  As we move through the other cohorts, that will happen as well.  I take on board the Deputy's comments.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding cohort 4, before I ask my colleague, Dr. Henry, to respond, I would like to make two brief points.  The advice from the national immunisation advisory committee remains that age is the priority for vaccination.  We should continue with our vaccination programme until we get through all of those aged 70 years and over. Cohort 4 is in sequencing after we get to all of those.  However, we are very conscious of the medically vulnerable and we are anxious to get to them as soon as we can.  The 10,000 figure is just to start the process this week, while we are analysing the data on which Dr. Henry will elaborate for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Reid give a rough estimate of when cohort 4 might be vaccinated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#G00700","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>The Deputy has gone over time.

I want to acknowledge the huge role that interns and junior doctors have played in the pandemic.  In the three surges in the past year, they were true front-line workers and they contributed hugely to our response in the hospital system.  Interns are trainee doctors in the sense they have got their medical degree and they complete this year under the supervision of a network of medical schools in the hospital system with a designated trainer before they get full registration when they qualify and then go on to training schemes, be it in general practice or in hospitals.  We cannot look at the numbers of interns we create in isolation.  We are moving from a system where we know we have too many non-training hospital doctors.  We want to move to a system where we have training opportunities for these interns so that the numbers who come through the intern year could then access what is basic specialty training, BST, then higher specialist training and then, in good manpower planning, can progress in their careers to become either general practitioners, public health or hospital-based consultants.  In looking at the number, it is not just a question of dealing in isolation with what is right or good for one group of a workforce alone.  It is how it integrates with other training requirements as they go on.<\/p> <p>  As I say, we are reviewing the quality and the configuration of the existing intern posts affiliated to the six medical schools and part of this will be looking at the number and seeing if we can increase the number in line with increased training opportunities.  On that point, last year we increased the number of training places, not only the intern places, in response to the crisis and we created additional fellowship posts to enable our trainees, not only interns or senior house officers, SHOs, as specialist registrars, to stay in Ireland beyond being an intern here.  We created additional training posts in public health, general practice, anaesthesia and other critical core specialties in response to the crisis and, as I said, additional fellowship posts which allowed them to complete higher specialist training here too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Henry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#H01100","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I, too, commend the HSE and the team - Mr. Reid, Dr. Henry and others - on their clear communication.

We would rate highly in European terms for our administration of vaccines per hundred thousand of population based on the level of supply.  We also rate highly on the distribution and administration of those vaccines.  Some 95% or more of any vaccines we get in a given week are administered within that week and, in some cases, within three days.  That is at a high level.<\/p> <p>  The approach we have taken to vaccinating, based on medical guidance from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, has been specifically to address the most vulnerable.  If one takes, for example, long-term care facilities or nursing homes, practically all of the residents and staff of nursing homes have received both doses of the vaccine, with the exception of a tiny few with a level of sickness that means we will have to go back to them.  The vast majority of residents of long-term care facilities, more than 90,000 people, will have received their first doses of the vaccine by the end of this week.  That is a highly vulnerable group in terms of impacts that include death and mortality.  <\/p> <p>  The situation is similar for addressing front-line healthcare workers who are also highly vulnerable.  We are vaccinating the over-70s who are living in the community.  We are seeing a benefit from the approach we are taking.  We are, thankfully, seeing reductions in mortality, infection rates in nursing homes, outbreaks in healthcare settings, the levels of sickness among the elderly population and the levels of sickness and absences from work through Covid infection among our healthcare workers.  Transmission levels have collapsed in the past four to six weeks as a result of the vaccination programme.  We are seeing strong benefits to date from the programme based on the prioritisation approach.  It is the right approach.<\/p> <p>  To return to the nub of the Senator's question, the pace of the roll-out will be a function of supply, which is currently the constraining factor when we consider how much quicker we might go.

There is, of course, concern that immune evasion may happen if certain mutations get a stronger footing.

The reason people may leave after their intern year may be precisely for that reason, the need to access training schemes.  Consequently, expanding the number of interns without planning for an expansion in the number of training schemes has the effect of kicking the problem down the road.  Part of manpower training, which I assure the Deputy is very actively taking place, is reducing our dependency on non-training doctors by converting those posts into training posts.  As part of our response, in July 2021 we created 106 additional places and many of them from existing non-training posts.  The reasons people may leave is to get training posts in other jurisdictions.  Our challenge is to reduce our reliance on non-training posts, which are not good for assistance and certainly not good for the doctors concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021030900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1615248000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>On the challenges facing the health service, for hospitals located outside of the main centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, it is difficult to fill a huge number of posts, whether they be registrars, senior registrars or senior house officers, SHOs, because the number of people coming in from outside of the European Union now is decreasing as well.
