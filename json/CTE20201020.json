Ash dieback, now known as <i>Hymenoscyphus fraxineus<\/i>, was discovered in 1992 in eastern Europe and since then has spread throughout Europe.  It is a windborne fungal disease, much like potato blight.  There is currently no means of treating this disease.  The spores can travel 20 km to 30 km in the air and infect ash trees through their leaves, causing the leaves to wilt and ultimately causing the tree to die.  It was first reported in Ireland in 2012, has spread throughout the country and is going to wipe out 95% of our native ash.  As an island nation more than 30 km from our nearest neighbour, we should have been in a position to prevent the invasion of the disease with proper phytosecurity.  Plants were imported from Europe where the disease was prevalent.  This importation defies logic as ash is a native tree and should have been propagated in this State.  There are 20,000 ha of privately planted ash in the country, all of which will ultimately be infected.  Ash trees were planted by farmers because ash is a native broadleaf which is fast growing and has high commercial potential, with hurley making being the primary use as well as other uses such as in furniture, kitchens and boat building.  It also has a high biodiversity value.<br\/><br\/>The current reconstitution and underplanting scheme, RUS, announced on 10 June 2020 has been completely rejected by farmers and foresters and all their representative bodies as it does not adequately address the enormous losses sustained and the extremely restrictive conditions imposed.  A clearance grant of &euro;1,000 goes nowhere near the cost of clearing an infected plantation, which can be in excess of &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 per acre depending on the size and age of the plantation.<br\/><br\/>The afforestation pioneers who planted over 25 years ago are relied upon within the sector for advice and experience but are precluded from participation in the RUS.  This is leading to a prevailing sense of disillusionment.  The value of these plantations has been reduced to the value of firewood.  At this point, a 25-year-old plantation should be 15 years away from significant commercial value, not to mention that the environmental benefits from decades of work are being undone.  A major incentive in planting ash trees was to provide financial security in retirement, but this potential opportunity has been destroyed.  These people have no responsibility for, nor any control over, these losses and are substantially stressed.  Other farming sectors have suffered disastrous losses from TB or foot and mouth disease and such losses were addressed immediately.  Due to the halting of the initial ash dieback scheme and delay in introducing the RUS on 10 June 2020, the farmer-forester has been left in limbo for at least six years while the disease has been allowed to run riot.  We now need to move forward in a positive direction.  The inaction to date is having a detrimental effect on farmers considering engaging in forestry.  Farmer-foresters are custodians for future generations and should be treated as having the potential to mitigate a lot of the climate problems.  That potential needs to be recognised.<br\/><br\/>The solution to this ash dieback problem should be addressed as follows:  First, consultation must involve engagement.<\/p><p>To date there has been a lack of engagement between the forest service and farmers and foresters.  It should be borne in mind that the farmer or forester is the primary stakeholder.  Any solution must encompass all infected ash plantations.  The conditions of the RUS need to be simplified so that the farmer or forester can progress with the process.  The programme must be easily understood.  It is suggested that, under the scheme, one may have to submit a Natura impact statement, which involves additional cost.<\/p><p> The costs incurred in the removal of stumps and roots should be covered, especially in older plantations where costs are enormous due to the size of stumps and roots.  The cost of replacing and replanting the trees should also be covered.  This needs to be followed by premiums of at least 15 years and an additional element to cover losses to date, not to mention the stress and trauma of this catastrophe.  There should be an option to return land to pasture for those farmers who need it.  This may not apply in all cases.<\/p><p> I will now go into the reasons our submission must be taken seriously.  Farmers and foresters are climate custodians.  There is no more efficient way of mitigating CO2 than planting trees.  A myriad of other health, social and ecological benefits are involved.  Forests produce oxygen, without which mankind will not survive.<\/p><p> If we want a forest industry in this country, we must address the ash dieback problem which is reducing confidence to zero.  We must be taken seriously.  Finally, we cordially extend an invitation to each member of the committee to visit infected sites.  If any members contact us, we will be happy to facilitate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome our witnesses.  I mean no offence but I wish to put something on the record.  The representatives' group is called Limerick and Tipperary Woodland Owners but I stress that this issue does not affect Limerick and Tipperary only.  I am from Westmeath and a farmer based outside Mullingar has contacted me with a serious problem in this regard.  While I am not coming at the witnesses, it is important to note that this is a national issue, although the group deals with Tipperary and Limerick.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of quick questions based on the submission.  It states that there was a lack of engagement with regard to the establishment of the RUS.  Was there any engagement at all?  I would like to know what engagement there was in respect of the formation of that scheme because one of the complaints I have heard from the individual I mentioned and from others is that the scheme is not effective and not enough but that, even if it was, its implementation has been a disaster.  It seems to be on park the whole time.  Even if one engages with the Department in respect of the scheme, the can is kicked down the road and no progress is made.  Regardless of the inefficiencies of the scheme itself, the Department is not operating it correctly.  Perhaps the representatives will elaborate on their experiences in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a few more questions on the disease in order to inform myself as much as anything else.  I will call it ash dieback rather than attempting to give it its full technical name.  One first notices that an ash tree is affected because of obvious signs on the leaves.  If immediate action is taken, is the timber still 100% useful or does it deteriorate or rot as the disease progresses?  If I grow ash trees and see from the leaves that the trees are affected, and if I get the go-ahead from the Department to harvest the timber, would it be salvageable?  I ask the witnesses to answer those questions as I believe they covered everything else in their submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#C00200","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603148400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I was recently at a site where hurley butts were being taken out.

That is ash dieback.<\/p><p>The timber can be recovered if it is cut down in time, but there is no means of processing it, other than for firewood, which is the only value it has.

That has been the case for the past five years.  In Tipperary, there reservoirs of the spores in plantations that have been left in limbo.  We are all in that situation, and it is too late to address it.  It is like the potato blight, without the bluestone, or whatever antifungal treatment there is.  It is going to spread throughout the country; one can see the ash trees on any road way that are dying and dead.  I look at my plantation, 50% of which is ash.  I have done my best to manage it for the past 25 years, and I am approaching an age, now, where I am considering retiring.

There is no doubt that trees that are affected are going to die.  Some 95% of ash trees in the country are going to die.  We are in a salvage operation.  The trees that are affected are not going to grow anymore, so they are not going to get to saw-log stage, and they will not end up as hurleys, if they are small trees which are at that stage.  There is a very limited period in which they will remain sound timber.  All they are at the moment is firewood, and the value of firewood will rocket downwards with oversupply because there will be so much ash being cut down.  What I am trying to say is that once it comes in, the disease cannot be stopped.  The disease is moving right across the countryside.  There may be some areas that have not yet been affected, but they are going to get it.  Until this year, we did not have much of it in our area, but now it is rampant throughout the forests.  It has stopped the growth and the trees are dying.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about engagement.  We were invited, at various times, to meet with the forest service when it was designing this scheme.  We said at that stage, from our experience as growers on the ground, that these measures were not going to help the situation.  It took seven years for the measures to be rolled out from when the original scheme ended.  There is no compensation involved; the only chance that anybody has out of this scheme is that they will get a chance to replant.  They will be going back to square one.  I planted 20 years ago and Mr. O'Connell planted 25 years ago.  We are not deemed to be eligible for the scheme.  Our trees are too big and too old, and we represent many people who are in the same boat.  The best that anyone with a plantation can get is to go back and plant from square one again.  When we did it 20 years ago, we got premiums for it.  We do not get premiums now and are not eligible for them.  We have been asked to do it again at this late stage in our lives.  We planted a generation ago and we have been asked to go back to square one again.

It is a generational thing.  Teagasc has done much work on disease-resistant varieties of ash.  It is not the case that ash will no longer grow in this country.  Of course, it will.  It is a fast-growing tree that is suitable for conditions here for many reasons, so long as it is disease resistant.  What knowledge do the witnesses have in that regard?<\/p><p> A more important option to which many people have referred is that of returning the land to pasture.

Mr. O'Connell suggested he may be getting out of the business.  There is a long lead-in time, encompassing a minimum period of 20 years.

The engagement we have had to date is that we have been brought into a room and allowed to express our views, but we have not been heard or listened to.  Our views have not been taken into consideration in the designing of schemes that we have stated will not work or address the problem.  I refer to our engagement with individual foresters and inspectors coming into farms.  It is a nightmare for anybody currently involved with forestry in general and not just those affected by ash dieback.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the RUS.  There are many things that are not addressed within the scheme.  He referred to the option of going back to grassland.  For many people, that it is the most viable option open to them.  It is not currently allowed.  It should be considered and introduced.  In terms of the management of the scheme, people are categorised according to the growth of their plantation.  That is incredibly unfair because it means that those who have the youngest plantations, with some years of premium still to be paid on them, have lost the least because they have lost the least amount of growth of their plantation.  They are being helped to replant.  However, those whose trees and plantations are older and who have invested a great deal of time, effort and money into them are experiencing significant losses.  A capital value should be placed on such plantations at this stage.  Many such plantations have been totally wiped out and many of those affected, such as Mr. O'Connell and me, are not eligible for any supports except under the woodland improvement scheme, which was not designed to deal with this issue.<\/p> <p>  A point that must be put across is that we did not bring in this disease.  It never should have got into the country.  It was rampant in Europe from the late 1990s.  The forest service knew that was the case.  Ash trees should have been propagated in this country and planted, but trees were imported and that brought the disease in.  We are an island nation and should have applied tighter security in order to keep it out.  So doing is the responsibility of the forest service but the threat is not being taken seriously.  There is a risk of other invasive species being brought in because we cannot cut down the timber that is currently needed for timber processing.  The whole system is such a mess that the only option is to import timber.  However, the dangers of so doing are right in front of us and we do not have a system to protect us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon White"},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

There are measures that could be introduced.  Most are encompassed in this type of scheme but the way that they have been put forward means that, for instance, the lack of premium would make a significant difference.  The scheme introduces underplanting, which means, for example, leaving 40% of the trees and underplanting.  That is a technique that has not been tried and, from our point of view as foresters, we know that if one underplants trees, those trees that are going to die will fall of their own accord, or we will fell them, and they will damage the trees that have been underplanted.  The documentation states that this measure has been introduced to stop the spread of the disease and the rate of spread.

Members talk about the value of the timber that comes out of it.  It is extremely expensive to extract timber from forestry.  The cost of firewood is going down and people cannot get &euro;35 per cu. m for it.  That is infinitesimal money compared with what a forest is worth.  Something has to be brought into the scheme to compensate for people's losses, to recognise the cost of measures to address the situation and the timing.<br\/><br\/>Everything has been kicked down the road.  Nobody who has applied for the scheme has been granted permission to do it yet and many people are wondering whether it is worth their while going into the scheme.  Everybody is waiting for the forest service to come up with something feasible, because it is not feasible for the people on the ground.  There is significant anger and frustration among people on the ground and a feeling of being let down.  There is also a feeling of despondency for anybody going into forestry in the future.  Who would go into forestry to be treated like this?  It is at a time when forestry and trees have so much to offer.  We should be going down that road.

They got the grant for the plantations.  The trees were not available in this country.  Nurseries were not growing them, and they were not encouraged to grow them.  Therefore, the private companies, through the forest service, had to get a licence to import those plants from other countries which planted a large amount of ash, such as France and the like.  However, it was known that the disease was prevalent in Europe at the time.  I contend that there was a responsibility on them for phyto security and to have checked out those plants.  Most of the plants came in under licence, which should never have been granted.  It was a disease that could have been kept out of the country.  It has now invaded our native ash, which has destroyed a huge asset of this country.  We and everybody else are the ones paying the price.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Browne was concerned about the cost of taking plantations out.  It costs approximately &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 per acre - that is &euro;10,000 per ha - to take the roots out of an ash plantation.  That is to clear the ground and get the roots out of a 20-year plantation.  That is a great deal of money for an individual to pay to get back to square one.  Then one must replant and start from scratch again.  One is replanting with a different species, if one wishes to do so.

For instance, ditching and mounding is not good for ash plantations.  I was told that every ash tree I had needed to be mounded.  For hurley butts that is not the best way of doing it; it is better to do it on flat ground.  I did not know that at the time, and we found out later.

Following the introduction of improved grants and premiums in the early 1990s, they became the driving force of the afforestation programme.  Farmer planting peeked in 1995 at more than 17,000 ha.  This year, farmer planting is expected to be less than 1,500 ha.<\/p><p> To date, almost 20,000 or 15% of farmers have diversified into forestry.  They manage nearly 270,000 ha of grant-aided forest land with an average forest size of eight ha.  The private forest estate, which is predominantly owned by farmers, accounts for 50% of the national forest estate.  Many of these forests have recently entered into the management stage with wood production expected to increase rapidly in the coming years as they reach maturity.  Wood production forecasts expect volumes to grow from 3 million cu. m in 2018 to nearly 8 million cu. m by 2035 with almost all of the increased volume to come from farm forests.<\/p><p> The importance of modern forestry and wood production in sequestering carbon and tackling the climate emergency is well known.  Wood production sequesters carbon, provides the raw material for green jobs and low-carbon manufacturing and reduces the reliance on imported timber, which may be harvested unsustainably from natural forests.  Yet despite the many benefits of our indigenous forest industry, multiple barriers to woodland creation and management exist resulting in missed opportunities to increase forest cover and to develop the potential in the bio-economy.  If we are to seize the opportunities offered by forestry, it is necessary to understand the reasons for the decline in farmer planting.<\/p><p> The Mackinnon review highlighted that farmers&rsquo; confidence and optimism regarding forestry has waned in recent years due to cumulative policy decisions such as the cut in forestry premiums and the removal of the farmer premium differential; the unwarranted retrospective recoupment of payments from farmers, in some instances, back 20 years on applications that had been approved by the Department; the introduction of arbitrary restrictions on land types suitable for forestry; the indecision and lack of adequate supports for forest owners affected by ash dieback; and excessive bureaucracy that has stifled development and made the cost of establishing or managing forests at farm scale prohibitive.  The consequence is that farmers no longer view forestry as a safe investment.  They feel increasingly like powerless spectators in the management of their own forests locked into forestry under the replanting obligation without recourse.<\/p><p> I will now discuss the forest licence system.  More than a thousand farmers who planted their land in good faith are caught up in the current forestry licence crisis and unable to get a licence to manage their forest.  They are facing delays of up to two years and in some instances significantly longer to get the licences required to build a forest road and to thin their forest.  The sustainable and timely management of forests is essential to optimise timber production and the economic return but also to maximise the ecosystem services and social benefits of these forests.  It is now a prerequisite to submit a Natura impact statement, NIS, with a licence application if one wishes to get a decision within a reasonable timeframe.  The majority of farm forests cannot support the cost of a NIS and farmers are being disadvantaged and discouraged with regard to managing their forests.  In addition, the Department has introduced a two-tiered system where larger applications are dealt with as a priority.  This actively discriminates against farmers with smaller forests on their farms.<\/p><p> These policies are unacceptable to the IFA and disproportionately affect farm forests that cannot justify the costs associated with planting and managing forests.  If the system is not made more farmer-friendly, the proposals set out in the programme for Government and the afforestation targets in the climate action plan will not be achieved.  Nearly 2,500 forest licences are caught up in the internal Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine forest licence system and the delays are having a greater impact on farmers as they typically apply when they need a licence.  The delays are forcing many into a non-thin policy.<\/p><p>The IFA has a number of proposals that it would like to see introduced as a matter of urgency and with the same determination shown by this Government and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, which saw recent forestry legislation enable the forestry appeals committee to function properly.  First, the forest licence system must ensure that no farmer has to wait longer than four months for a forestry licence as set out in the Forestry Act 2014 and the farmer's charter.  There should be a review of the appropriate assessment, AA, screening process, associated rules and thresholds so that the AA screening is cost free to the farmer whereby the Department screens a proposed project to determine its impact on Natura sites and if an NIS is required.  A threshold should be introduced similar to thresholds applied in agriculture where only proposed forestry projects above 15 h would be screened in.  The 15 km radius \"likely zone of impact\" employed by the Department should be re-assessed and the radius employed tailored to the size and nature of the application.  A cost-based planning support grant for forest owners to assist with increased costs and requirements associated with applying for a felling and afforestation licence should be introduced.  The Forestry Act 2014 should be amended to introduce new exemptions for activities, such as forest road construction and thinning operations, that are considered good management practices.  <\/p><p> The timber shortages resulting from the forest licence backlog are threatening the industry, an industry that in normal time exports approximately &euro;1 billion worth of timber each year.  These shortages are jeopardising jobs and businesses that have been built up over the last 40 years to support the expansion of the private forest sector.  They are also forcing saw millers to import timber when we are actually self-sufficient, which is unnecessarily endangering the health of the national forest estate through the potential introduction of pests and disease.  The need for action on these proposals cannot be understated.<\/p><p> I will now comment on ash dieback.  The risk posed by the increased importation of timber to the health of the national estate is a serious concern for forest owners considering the scale of the infestation in Europe of bark beetle.  Farmers have first-hand experience of the devastation caused by ash dieback with regard to the survival, growth and wood quality of ash trees and, therefore, the devastating consequence for the commercial value of their timber crop.  The reconstitution and underplanting scheme, RUS, is wholly inadequate to compensate forest owners for the financial loss incurred by the disease.  The scheme does not include any market valuation or income support measures.  Farmers whose livelihoods have been impacted by disease in other agricultural commodities receive income support.  Farmers involved in forestry must to be treated in a similar manner.  There is no scientific evidence that thinning infected plantations is beneficial in the long term when ash dieback is present.  Where dieback is severe, research suggests that the best approach is to harvest the remaining commercial timber before value depreciation and to replant the area with other tree species.  The current scheme is forcing farmers to manage a dying crop and invest money into a crop that will yield a very limited return, if any.  It is a ludicrous situation and a clear sign of the disconnect between Government policy and forest owners not to mention the huge health and safety risk to forest owners and operators working in these forests.  This has not been fully considered by the Department.  The programme for Government is focused on increasing the level of planting on farms, particularly the planting of broadleaves to create wildlife corridors and increase biodiversity within our forest estate.  If the Government is committed to these proposals, forest owners whose ash forests are being devastated by the disease must be supported.<\/p><p> The IFA proposes the following measures are introduced to ensure that farmers affected by the disease are appropriately supported to manage infected plantations.  All infected plantations - both grant aided and non-grant aided - must be eligible for a 100% reconstitution grant to support forest owners to clearfell and replant with tree species that satisfy their management objectives.<\/p><p>Forest premiums must be paid on replanted land for 15 years according to the grant premium category, GPC, rate established.  The option not to replant, without penalties, must also be available in certain circumstances.  The farming community is watching to see if the Government redresses the supports offered.  It will be instrumental in restoring confidence in forestry as a land use option.<\/p><p> The IFA welcomes the proposal in the programme for Government to reintroduce the farmer premium differential.  This will be hugely important to address some of the opposition to forestry, and will ensure that the full economic impact of forestry is local, contributing to employment and sustaining rural communities.  A whole-of-government approach is needed to develop a farmer-friendly system that actively supports and encourages farmers to manage their forests.  Then, and only then, will we see farmers re-engage with forestry at a level required to meet our climate change targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I thank the president of the IFA and his team.

They are turning farmers totally and utterly against the idea of going into forestry.  It is being said that it is no longer a safe investment.

It is one thing we could do with immediate effect, and it would resolve the backlog of 2,500 licences.  The majority of the farmers within those are caught up with thinning and road building.  Very few farmers have got to the clear-fell stage.<\/p> <p>  We need to make it farmer friendly.  We need to address the blockages in the legislation, and we need to simplify the process.  The average size is 8 ha.  In many cases it is smaller.  It needs to go through minimum costs of &euro;1,500 just to get the licence at a time when it is not a highly profitable operation.<\/p> <p>  On attracting farmers into forestry, COFORD has assessed 180,000 ha of available land that has the productive capacity to grow timber, is outside designations and is excluded from the programme at the moment.  That area coming in would result in an uplift if the right grants and premiums were introduced.  There is land available.  We need to review what we are doing.  We need to make the system more farmer friendly and understand the scale of forestry - that it is forestry on farms.  There is considerable interest among farmers in planting, but we have made the system too difficult for farmers to plant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their submissions.  I had to leave for a few minutes.  We need to call a spade a spade here.  In farming terms there is a saying that the day one buys is the day one sells.  The day someone plants trees, after going through all the hoops, there should be a follow-on process for putting in a road so that he or she has everything the day he or she starts.  That could include a licence to drive a lorry, though one could drive a car or whatever right through as well.  We need a system like that where people can bring their road and have it earmarked the day they plant their trees, which they will be thinning when they are fit.  Farmers are not crazy.  They do not go out thinning when the trees are not ready.  They go cutting when they are ready.  We need some sort of a system like that.  We have to get back to the nub of the issue.  We can have all the legislation in the world but we need a new system.  The legislation was driven through fairly quickly.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the habitats directive has been brought in.  That is the simple fact about it.  Everything within 15 km of a designated area has to be screened out.  No more than with farming, we cannot do today what we did 20 years ago.  In the system that was there down through the years, farmers got help from their forestry person, sent in an application and went to the forestry inspector.  The inspector then looked at it and said it was a great job and lovely land which would suit the job perfectly and he or she would go out, look at it and go through it and give the go-ahead.  Things progressed and we brought in the habitats directive.  Now, when an application comes in there are the legal challenges.  We might not like objectors but they saw the gate they could go out.  It is as simple as that.  We left it open for them.<\/p> <p>  Since 2010 we have never achieved what we said we would on planting.  Only 57% of our worst planting has been planted since 2016.  That is because it is held up and because we decided the same system would be used.  Now, because of legislation, when the people who were perfect for the job look at an application, they are not qualified as ecologists to screen it in or out.  That is no disrespect to them.  Everything has to be screened in and applications are in a muddle with all the rest of them holding it up.  If I had someone working for me for four or ten years who only achieved 50% of a target, he or she would be answering questions.  Unfortunately, that will not happen in the Ireland we live in today.  It is no wonder farmers will not plant.<\/p> <p>  We had two tsunamis.  First, we had the Coillte contracts, with which Mr. Cullinan and the IFA are dealing.  In their own opinion, farmers have been burned by those contracts.  Second, there are many farmers at the moment who have been waiting up to two or three years for the go-ahead.  They are left in a quagmire.  They just get sick of it.  We can have the farming organisations, all the politicians and everything else, but the EU legislation is there.  If someone is putting in a road, if it is within 15 km there are designations.  I am well used to it where we are from.  Screening is the first thing and then one has to go through an NIS, an EIA or an AA if it will not screen out.  We are in that barrel at the moment and we have to make sure that whoever has all the letters after their name is the person who can look at it first to shoot it out of the way and get it sorted quickly.<\/p> <p>  We can talk about forestry.  Some 12,000 jobs will be at stake.  Timber is being brought into this country at the moment.  There is moss peat coming into Dundalk and timber coming into Cork and Limerick.  One would wonder what we are doing.  What we are at in this country at the moment is like bringing oil to the Arabs.  We need to change the system.  The system now, because of the legislation, means the people who know more about timber than anyone, and have probably forgotten more about it than most people know, can no longer legally look at applications when they go to a European court because they do not have the qualifications or the letters after their names.  Unless we change that system we will be here again next year and the year after.<\/p><p>Three and a half years ago, I met with the Department about this problem and flagged what was going on, because farmers come to me and tell me what is going on.  If everything is going grand, I will never see them and there is no bother.  They were told the Department was going to do the devil and all, but it was not done and we are where we are now.  The legislation might speed up appeals a bit, but if we keep giving the same piece of paperwork to the same drummer instead of a guitar player, we will have the same problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#V00100","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cullinan and Ms O'Sullivan for their opening statement and their contributions so far.  I welcome Mr. Cullinan's opening statement.  It highlights very clearly the Government's ambition, but equally, the disconnect between ambition and policy.  As practitioners on the ground, farmers and foresters are best placed to outline where those gaps are and how we might streamline the systems we have.  I thank him for that and look forward to engaging with him in the future on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on Deputy Fitzmaurice's point on the habitats directive.  That has been in place since 1992 and dictates how we roll out forestry in Ireland.  We have to abide by it and there is no change in the habitats directive.  I would like to think we can have a flourishing forestry sector and meet the Government's ambition while remaining within the bounds of the habitats directive.  With that point in mind, I refer to the Natura impact statements that are required.  Mr. Cullinan mentioned that the cost of these is quite prohibitive for many forestry applicants.  Will he give me an indication of what that cost might be for a typical site?<\/p> <p>  The IFA is asking for a cost-based planning support measure to help applicants deal with increased costs associated with felling or afforestation licences.  What are the main sources of cost increases?  Are they specifically due to requirements in the legislation or are they related to general cost increases in the industry or a lack of qualified personnel?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#W00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603148400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Fitzmaurice's points first.  He said that once one plants, the plan should follow through.  That is exactly what we are saying.  If forestry is planted, obviously the next process is that a road needs to go in for the wood to be taken out.  What follows on from that is the thinning process.  We are all on the same page here.  Why a licence has to be acquired for that, particularly in a farmer's situation, is beyond me.  One of the key asks we have today is for that to be freed up, which would help get timber flowing again and slow down or do away with the current requirement to import timber, which I highlighted already.  It is an absolute scandal that we have all this timber and that sawmills have to import it.  As Deputy Martin Browne rightly raised earlier, the risk of disease coming in would create another problem.  We have one problem with the ash dieback and we do not want another.<\/p> <p>  The gate probably was left open for objectors and that is a concern in many sectors in the country.  That process has created mayhem in the system and there are many things there that could be put right.  How are serial objectors allowed to happen in the first place?  By not needing a licence for thinning and road building, we would get around part of that, so while that process is being washed through the system, at least some of the work could be going ahead.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right.<\/p><p>The Coillte contracts in the past did not work out for farmers.  I accept that.  Many farmers did not come out of that process very well.  We have been talking about the two years waiting, but we are all saying the same thing here in that regard, and also on the issue of jobs.  Mention was made of the forestry guy coming out in the past and that was the system.  I was not responsible, however, for whoever put all this regulation and red tape in place.  We have seen it across all sectors, and the more red tape that exists, the more that will slow down the process.  Turning to the comments made by Deputy Leddin welcoming our statement, we need support in that regard.  I ask Ms O'Sullivan to address the habitats directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603148400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Regarding the Natura impact statement, there is a minimum associated cost with that of &euro;1,000, which increases depending on the scale of the forest.  We have heard figures of up to &euro;20,000 from farmers, depending on the interaction with Natura sites.  The minimum, however, is &euro;1,000 and I think that would cover it.  The issue is that even if a forest does not require an NIS, an NIS is required just to get into the system now.  It seems to be a major waste of resources that it is necessary to submit an NIS even if a forest has been screened by the Department as not requiring an NIS.  I am dealing, therefore, with farmers who are paying that &euro;1,000 and they might have a site of 2 ha.  That is absolutely undermining any kind of reality.<\/p> <p>  In addition, to try to solve the objections initially, the harvesting plan with increased environmental technicality was introduced by the Department.  There is a minimum cost of applying for that of &euro;500.  What this time two years ago, therefore, was a zero-cost application for a farmer now costs a minimum of &euro;1,500.  That is because the forestry companies can no longer take the cost, which they did in the past because they had turnover, they knew they would have got the timber out and they could have entered into an arrangement with a farmer in that regard.  Now, however, there is a minimum cost to get an application into the system of &euro;1,500, and that is being done even when an NIS is not required.<\/p> <p>  That is the basis upon which we want the grant to be introduced.  I refer to legislative costs having increased and not any costs by forestry companies or commercial costs.  We would like to see some supports in respect of the increased harvesting plan requirements.  I also refer to it now being obligatory to have an NIS, whether it is required or not.  There should be some supports in that regard as well.  The reality is that screening under the habitats directive was instituted to determine if the forestry operation on its own, or in combination, would have a significant impact.  <\/p> <p>  It is our view that small-scale farm forestry will not have a significant impact and that is why we have proposed that we look at the thresholds in this context. It is standard practice, and we do it in planning all the time where thresholds are introduced where that is not required.  In the context of the ambitions of this Government, in particular, we think this is essential.  If we want to have more trees and farms, that situation must be reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I apologise for having had to step out of the meeting to speak in the Chamber.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations, and I agree it is a pity we could not get full input from the other IFA representatives regarding the problems that exist.  The engagement today in both sessions has been useful and important.<\/p> <p>  Forestry strategy has been a failure in this State.  In fact, to call it a strategy at all would be overly generous.  I have often cited the three things that I believe a good forestry strategy should deliver.  Such a strategy should deliver for the environment, for local economies and for the local communities located close to forests.  I have often stated that we have managed to develop a policy that does none of those things.  I think we can add a fourth aspect today.  Good forestry policy should also deliver for the farming community, and the evidence we have heard shows very clearly that it has not done so.<\/p><p>In the first session today, we learned that a failure of policy, and I think that is the kindest way to put it, means that we have potentially wiped out an entire indigenous broadleaf species.  I refer to the ash tree, the wood synonymous with our national sport and that should be one of the most protected parts of our natural heritage.  That is being wiped out because somebody thought it was a good idea to import ash, a native species, at a time when the ash dieback disease was prevalent in countries from which those imports were coming.<\/p><p> What we have also learned today, and this is the starkest figure of all, is that an estimated 1,500 ha of forestry will be planted this year.  If that does not signal that we are at a crisis point, then I do not know what will.  We must get over those failures.  We are told by Government that there will be a new forestry strategy.  We need to learn, therefore, from the mistakes and ensure we put in place the provisions required to address all those previous mistakes.<\/p><p> Turning to my questions for the witnesses, and regarding the presentation we had earlier from farmers and landowners affected by the ash dieback disease, several solutions were mentioned by those farmers.  I think the witnesses broadly agree with those solutions.  Has a cost been associated with those potential solutions?<\/p><p> Regarding broader forestry issues, which are crucially important, does the Department have proposals or suggestions - assuming we can get all the issues already raised correct -  to achieve a greater spread of planting?  I mean that geographically, across farms, because I think there is a broad acceptance that rather than having an entire county planted with Sitka spruce, for example, it would be better if every county and most farmers within every county planted some of their land.  That would be the preference, without forcing people down that route, and that is what we should be encouraging.  Do the representatives of the Department have any propositions to put to the committee that we could suggest would facilitate such an approach and help to ensure that is the case?  Are there also any proposals to encourage people to move from planting Sitka spruce to planting more native broadleaf trees, considering the financial implications in the short and medium term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#X00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>We are all on the one hymn sheet this evening.  I am disappointed that no Minister is here to listen to us nor anyone from the Department.  I state that because this is an important topic.<\/p> <p>  When we talk to farmers about forestry, they only shake their heads now.  For too long and under successive Governments, we have been asking for some kind of grant assistance or to be allowed to plant on marginal ground.  We are not allowed to do that, however, and there is no talk about the grant.  It is necessary to plant 80% green ground and 20% marginal ground.  We have been trying to address that situation for several years now.  My father before me and now I and my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, have been raising this issue for so long because south Kerry, especially, has much ground that is marginal for any type of farming, but it would be grand to grow Sitka spruce.<\/p> <p>  I heard Deputy Carthy suggesting we should have native trees instead of Sitka spruce.  The thing about this situation is that native trees will not grow in the type of ground which I am talking about, while Sitka spruce will.  We would have a saleable product if we were allowed to do what we were allowed to do before.<\/p><p> In 1950, my father starting working in the forestry with his spade and he learned to drive a bulldozer which opened up a lot of opportunities for him after that.  I, too, have worked in forestry and I know that Coillte had difficulty getting felling licences for the last two or three years for ground where trees had already been felled twice.  There was no problem getting the two first rounds of felling licences but felling came to a standstill for the third crop.  The blackguards who lodged appeals and blocked the work are only one side of the story because the other side is the Department as it did not process the applications in the way it should have.  The whole thing has been let go out of control.  We went through all this the night of the debate about the new legislation that was brought in about appeals and I do not see the timeline having much of an effect.  There is no timeline for how long it will take for an appeal to be processed.  When a person gets permission to plant a forestry and gets a grant for the work then, God Almighty, sure there has to be presumption that one will be allowed to cut down the trees and make a road into the location.  I gave my life making roads and there was no question in the world up until a couple of years ago and one was tutored on how to mind the environment.  For example, one had to put in silt traps and the pearl water mussel had to protected.  We did all of those things without the help of interfering people and now they get too much hearing.  <\/p><p> So much of what we had has been dismantled such as the ridiculous move to shut down the sugar industry and the closing down of Bord na M&oacute;na.  All recent Governments, including the current one, have dismantled what previous good Governments put in place and with all the technology and things that we have now it is backwards we are going.  With the Natura impact statement and all these things Coillte and all of the forestry companies were able to deal with the environment.  No one protects the environment more than the landowners, and without interruptors and interferers from between 200 and 300 miles away lodging applications to stop someone like the man who is a wheelchair user and contacted me over the last year and half.  He planted his forestry 28 years ago and applied for a felling licence but people objected to him making a road into his plantation.  The man wanted to use the money earned from selling his trees to adapt his house and ensure his family, wife and whatever youngster was with him had a bit of an income.  The objectors are blackguarding, which is wrong and when it is wrong it is never right.  These people who are getting a hearing put in several objections.  One man lodged 144 objections in February 2019 so he should be carried to court and locked up.<\/p><p> I am very grateful for the chance to talk to the witnesses.  One can forget about forestry in Kerry, especially south Kerry now, because young fellas will not consider such work because they have seen all the complications.  They will get no bit of a grant to plant marginal land.  Such land is absolutely good for nothing.  Deputy Eamon Ryan used to talk about planting trees and now that his Green Party is in government there will be no change and places with marginal land will not be planted.  I do not know what the blockage is or the mindset but one must plant 80% good ground to be allowed to plant 20% marginal ground.<\/p><p>Where is the logic in that?  Does the Government want to blow us out of existence altogether by keeping things at a standstill?  If Deputy Carthy looks at all of the farms, and some time I will take him around south Kerry, he will see that most of them have the reverse situation with only 20% of green ground and 80% of marginal ground.  However, one will only get a grant to plant the marginal ground if one has 80% green ground and 20% of marginal ground.  I have raised this matter several times before of which Deputies Jack Cahill and Charlie McConalogue would be aware when they were members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  A case needs to be made for this set-up, otherwise talking about forestry is total baloney and codology.<\/p><p> I wish to say, as Mr. Cullinan is here, that there is a very important issue following the announcement of the move to level 5 because farmers will be unable to go into marts.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#Y00200","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Can the Deputy please stick to discussing forestry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#AA00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>All right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020102000002#AA00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603148400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Deputy Carthy said that the forestry strategy \"has been a failure\".  He made a couple of good points and is right that it needs to deliver for the environment.  The way I look at it is that farmers are the first responders to deliver on the environment, we have done so and we need to be acknowledged for what we have done to date.  The Deputy is right that the strategy must be good for the economy and for where people live.  In response I would say that one needs to strike a balance and planting needs to be shared in the different regions.  We have parts of the country where farmers are willing to plant but they have hen harrier designated land.  It is a separate issue but it could be looked at as well to bring balance.  In terms of the 1,500 acres, we all agree that where we are is in crisis.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the cost of Ash dieback.  It is very hard to give an exact figure but we estimate that between 22,000 and 25,000 hectares of Ash trees have been planted around the country.  A lot of that is affected and it will cost to take the wood out. People can harvest what is good but the remainder would have to be taken out.  One would have to replant and a farmer would have to be compensated for income foregone in the 15 years while the trees grow again.  We estimate that it would cost somewhere in the region of &euro;15 million per year to reconstitute and reach the point of harvest which, in my view, would be money very well spent.<\/p> <p>  Like Deputy Healy-Rae said about the mix, we have people here whose hardwood planting failed.  It is, therefore, critical and essential that compensation is put in place for those people to reconstitute the Ash one.  <\/p> <p>  The people in the county that I come from like Ash trees, and play a bit of ground hurling now and again.  I agree 100% with what a member said about our national heritage.<\/p> <p>  In terms of planting spruce and native broadleaf trees, we all know that there is pressure coming there.  Many farmers have an acre or two of areas on their land on which broadleaf trees could be planted.  We could also consider planting along hedgerows.  Perhaps people, when cutting hedgerows, could leave a number of trees to grow.  We all want to play our part in climate change and we have an excellent opportunity here now.  I know climate change is a different debate but carbon sequestration is linked to trees.<\/p><p>Farmers are doing and have been doing a public good.  That needs to be acknowledged also.  We have no problem in stepping up to the plate and doing more on that.  We can have integration.  Forestry will absolutely help in the climate change debate, and we are willing to do that.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Healy-Rae's comments, I know Kerry quite well.  I spent a good bit of time down there last year.  I get what he is saying.  This is the legislation we are dealing with.  What he said is probably something we could examine.

We believe it would open up a lot of land.  It is a much better system than is currently used.

This is important legislation that will give effect to Ireland's obligations under European law and put appropriate protections in place with regard to the abstraction of water from our rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater sources.<\/p> <p>  The water framework directive which was adopted in 2000 requires EU member states to take the necessary measures to achieve and maintain good ecological status in the water environment.  Among the obligations the directive places on us is the requirement to have a system of registration and control over the abstraction of water.  Existing provisions dealing with water abstractions date from 1942 and obviously predate the introducing of the directive.  At present Ireland is not fully compliant with the directive and this forms part of an infringement action brought by the European Commission against Ireland.  The Department is committed to addressing this through this legislation.  <\/p> <p>  The general scheme proposes a three-tiered registration licensing system for the abstraction of water, with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, responsible for establishing and maintaining a database of registrations and licensing.  At the lowest level all abstracters will be required to abide by a set of general binding principles issued by the EPA in the form of guidelines.  These will relate to water conservation and public health issues such as ensuring pollutants do not enter the water, minimising leakage, as well as technical matters such as measuring or estimating the volume of water abstracted.  Abstractions of 25 cu. m or more per day will require registration with the EPA.  This is already happening by way of regulations introduced in 2018 and those provisions will be restated in this new Bill.  By way of comparison, a well for a private house would extract up to 1 cu. m per day.  <\/p> <p>  The highest tier of control will be licensing.  This will apply to all abstractions of 2,000 cu. m per day or more and also those abstractions of between 250 cu. m and 1,999 cu. m per day deemed by the EPA to be significant.  A significant abstraction is one that causes the water body in question to be at risk or potentially at risk from over abstraction resulting in its failing to achieve its environmental objectives or placing it at risk of failing to do so.<\/p><p>The most recent published information from the EPA indicates around 6% of water bodies in Ireland are potentially at environmental risk due to abstraction pressures. <\/p><p> As well as fulfilling our obligations under the water framework directive, the Bill is also required in order to license large-scale water abstractions, particularly for public water supplies.  The legislation is key to enabling the planned eastern and midlands region water supply project, which is intended to supply water to Dublin where water supply is at critical levels, as well as areas of the east and midlands.  It will ensure that an appropriate legal framework and consenting process is in place to facilitate consideration and determination of this project. <\/p><p> The legislation is intended to be graduated and proportionate.  Small scale abstractions do not generally pose a risk to the water environment.  Accordingly, there are no obligations placed on small-scale abstractors other than abiding by general binding rules.  Only larger abstractions and those posing a risk will have to apply for a licence.<\/p><p> Throughout the development of this draft general scheme, there has been detailed engagement with other Departments and a range of stakeholders.  The Department has worked closely with the Environmental Protection Agency, which will oversee and implement the new requirements.  There have also been close contacts with large-scale water abstractors, including Irish Water, the ESB and Waterways Ireland, in developing these proposals. <\/p><p> We have endeavoured to achieve a balance in the legislation between the necessary environmental protections and the need to minimise the administrative burden placed on abstractors, some of which may have been freely abstracting water for many years.  The Department has aimed to place proportionality at the heart of the measures and the general scheme offers a measured and fair way to protect our water environment and implement the necessary controls over the abstraction of water. <\/p><p> We welcome the views of the committee on these proposals, which we will consider and report back to the Minister.  I am happy to answer any questions members might have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020102000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emer Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Connolly.

They are not directly affected by the Bill insofar as there is no requirement for households using that level of water to register.  As the threshold is above 25 cu. m per day it will not bring in domestic water users but may include a number of smaller enterprises such as large dairy farmers, large hotels and some SME businesses that might use a fair bit of water.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, and the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, all have responded to the public consultation as well as environmental non-governmental organisations, NGOs, on what levels the controls should have an impact.  There will not be a direct impact on the vast majority of private people or very small consumers.  There is a provision for general binding rules, which just say that anybody abstracting water cannot or should not pollute and should watch the leakage but that should happen anyway.  I do not see a very wide number of people being impacted.  It is the larger abstractors of water that we are wishing to engage such as the IFA, NGOs, IBEC, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, etc. and they have engaged.  There are further options to engage as we continue the legislative process.  We will consider any views that the committee has or views that arise as we progress the legislation.<\/p> <p>  On the transparent operation of the licensing regime, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will be the regulatory authority in this respect.  As with all regulatory functions carried out by the EPA, it is very good with producing annual reports on everything that it does, in terms of transparency, registrations and identifying issues that might need to be addressed.  There are provisions that allow elements of the regime to be amended by regulation.  We, as a Department, keep very close contact with the EPA in that regard.

I wish to make a couple of introductory comments.  As per normal, I have a long list of technical questions and if I do not get through them in five minutes then I hope to be allowed to ask a second round of questions or submit them in writing.<\/p> <p>  It is important for the committee to understand that it is almost 20 years since the Water Framework Directive placed an obligation on the State to have this kind of an abstraction regime.  I wish to make it clear to members that we are currently subject to enforcement proceedings by the Commission on our failure to do that.<\/p><p>That is not a criticism of the officials; it is just part of the background to this issue.  I have a genuine concern that what is being proposed in these heads is the absolute minimum the Department and Government think will get us through those legal requirements.  I am genuinely surprised at the thresholds, so many of my questions relate to them.<\/p><p> Head 5 refers to general binding rules, but they are not rules in real terms.  They are simply self-regulations.  There is no mechanism for inspection or enforcement, so while the EPA will publish the rules, no one will know whether anyone complies with them because there is no mechanism to inspect and enforce.  Head 5 also states that the threshold of 25 cu. m does not require anything other than abiding by these self-regulations.  Just so committee members are clear on how much water that is, it is the equivalent daily usage of 225 people.  That is quite a lot of water, even for a small SME, to have no regulatory cover whatsoever.  While the Department mentions in its explanatory note that it is trying to mirror what is happening in Scotland and the North of Ireland, they have a much lower threshold of 10 cu. m, which is the daily household usage of 90 people.  What is the rationale for not going for the 10 cu. m used in the North?<\/p><p> I also have a concern about head 7, which states that the Minister will be involved in effecting potential registration agreements.  Why is that the case?  Why is the Minister given that role, on foot of a report from the EPA?  Most other forms of permission we deal with, such as planning permission, are decided by independent bodies rather than a political figure.<\/p><p> Head 8 relates to significant abstractions.  Again, for the information of committee members, 2,000 cu. m is the equivalent daily usage of 18,000 people.  That is the only point at which one needs a licence.  Anybody who is extracting any less than the equivalent usage of 18,000 people per day will not need to have a licence.  I do not understand the rationale for that.  What are the equivalent thresholds in Scotland and the North of Ireland and why have we diverted from those?<\/p><p> As regards head 10, it seems there is no public participation in the licence grant process.  Correct me if I am wrong but it does not seem to be listed here.  That would suggest we have big legal problems with our adherence to both the habitat and environmental impact assessments.  If there is no clear public participation in that licensing process, can Mr. &Oacute; Coighligh explain the outlines for that?  I might stop there.  If I have more time I will come back in, either in this round or the second round. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020102000002#E00900","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The Deputy can get more answers in the second round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020102000002#F00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603148400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the Deputy's questions as best I can.  He said it has been quite some time since the directive came into force.  As in many cases with legislation, there is an existing regime regarding abstraction of water.  Sometimes it is felt that that is sufficient and it becomes apparent over time that it is not.  That is why this may not have been a priority at the beginning, because there was an existing law in relation to the abstraction of water.  Nonetheless, as jurisprudence has developed and the implementation of the environmental directives has tightened up, it has become clear that the Irish legislative framework was not sufficient.<\/p> <p>  There is absolutely a debate around thresholds.  That was one of the significant areas of discussion in the consultations the Department received.  Environmental NGOs wished to see a lower threshold, while others wished to see it maintained or increased.  We looked to other jurisdictions.  As the Deputy mentioned, 10 cu. m is the threshold in the North and in Scotland.  We stuck with the 25 cu. m threshold as that was, in effect, the existing threshold under the current legislation.  We have the benefit of experience in that, in terms of the environmental issues facing Ireland, we are not under pressure with abstractions.  As Ms Connolly pointed out in her opening statement, the EPA reckons that around 6% of water bodies are under some pressure.  It is not as significant an environmental pressure as in other areas, and therefore we need to make sure our level of control is appropriate to the issue which arises.<\/p><p>Under the general scheme, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is to be given the power to recommend that the level be adjusted, if it considers it appropriate.  There is also provision in the Bill for the Minister to introduce regulations, to be agreed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, which would allow that threshold to be lowered.  This issue can be looked at again in the future if the EPA recommends it.  The EPA acts as the environmental expert and advises Government in this area.<\/p><p> With regard to general binding rules, the set of rules is indeed softer.  It can be thought of as a stepped-up system of general principles by which we hope to abide.  It specifies the point at which we want people to register so that we can be aware of the existence of their abstraction points, the point at which they may need to be licensed, whether the EPA consider the abstraction to be significant, and the point at which licensing is absolutely required.  It is a tiered system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020102000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603148400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>We are out of time on this question.

In responding to Senator Fitzpatrick, Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh said that this would not affect the hundreds of thousands of people who draw water for their domestic supply.  How is it determined that it is the same body of water from which water is drawn?  If neighbours in the same area were drawing from the same surface water or groundwater supply, could they be considered to exceed the threshold and therefore have to register?

This gives the EPA the option to consider cumulative impacts.  The EPA is more qualified to answer than I am but I suspect that, in most cases, relatively low levels of abstraction will not be a problem in most areas.  In some areas, such as the Dublin region which is obviously very important, in the absence of a major new supply, Irish Water will be looking at options for additional groundwater abstraction points.  In major urban areas, it may have to be considered whether the groundwater supply would be under stress if additional abstractions points were introduced.

One of the first things stated today was the importance of Dublin.  Dublin may be important as the capital, but Limerick is equally important, especially when one is talking about the Shannon and abstractions from it.

A cluster of smaller schemes may be set up under one scheme, and those schemes have not yet been taken over by the local authorities.  What is the registration point for such schemes, which could include ten, 15 or even 20 houses?<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin also stated that 25 cu. m of water is equal to the usage of 220 people.  However, it is not equal to the usage of many cattle in a rural area, when one has to supply different amounts of water to the cattle, depending on the time of year.  <\/p> <p>  Another question I have concerns the point of registration for local authorities, such as fire stations.  How does one monitor the water usage of a fire station or a fire service training centre?  I do not think one can.  What is the regulation in that area within the current framework?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020102000002#H00900","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603148400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>On group schemes, any body or person who abstracts water above the threshold will have to register or obtain a licence.

That is a good thing because we can see from the documentation there is a lack of accuracy and knowledge in terms of how much water is currently being extracted.  We have data from some local authorities but much of it is out of date and has not been followed up on.  It surprises me to hear that only 6% of water bodies are under pressure, although, admittedly, that figure just relates to extraction.  All our water bodies are currently under pressure, including groundwaters, lakes and rivers.  Water quality is deteriorating, as is demonstrated year after year in EPA surveys.  It is really important that we get an accurate figure for how much is being extracted before we can suggest that only 6% of water bodies are under pressure from extraction.  The more water we draw off, the more environmental impact it will have.<\/p> <p>  When water is drawn from a source, it must go back through some sort of treatment.  Much of the time, it is probably not treated before going back into the water body.  Does the extraction also take account of the discharge of the water in whatever format it goes back into the water system?  It is very important to have accurate measurement.<\/p> <p>  It is suggested in the legislation that we will use a model similar to that in usage in Scotland.  A figure of 10 cu. m was set as the threshold for notifiable there, but the Bill proposes a figure of 25 cu. m.  What is the rationale behind that?

That is a much more pressing problem.  We take the figures estimated by the EPA.  The committee may seek to hear evidence from the EPA.  That is where we get our figures.<\/p> <p>  On the 25 cu. m threshold for registration, that is the figure used under the existing legislation.<\/p><p>Arguments were made to raise the threshold, primarily by environmental NGOs, and to maintain it, primarily by the farming, agricultural, business and small business sectors.

That was the rationale we adopted.  It does not deal with the issue of discharge.  If water, for example, is abstracted for a golf course, it will be used on the grass, while in agriculture it will be used for irrigation, and domestically it will go through the wastewater system, whether that is a private standalone system or the public system.

When we talk about a threshold of 10 cu. m versus 25 cu. m, for example, it must be a meaningful provision.  We need to include in the guidelines the facility to have an accurate recording of the water being abstracted, the quality of that water and the measurement of it.  I listened to what was said earlier about there being a bureaucracy and administration around this issue, but the technology has moved on and there are smart metering devices and software that allow for real-time reporting.  If we are serious about protecting and managing our water supplies, we need to make that level of investment.  Water is a finite natural resource and we cannot manage it in an outdated administrative environment.<\/p> <p>  I have similar concerns about how meaningful the provisions under head 7 will be.  They deal with the introduction of an offence of abstracting water where it is not done legitimately.  If this head is to have any meaning, we must ensure that what is being abstracted is measured, and that goes back to the strengthening of the guidelines under head 5 and making them more requirements than guidelines.  If head 7 is going to define an offence, what will be the penalty for that offence, how will it be prosecuted and who will prosecute it?<\/p> <p>  Finally, head 9 includes a reference to how an abstraction will be deemed significant.

They are very welcome.  Sitting on both this committee and the agriculture committee, I can appreciate the great importance of what they are saying today.  Certainly, it is something I will bring to the other committee when we meet this evening.  The Water Framework Directive requires us to have a system of registration and a monitoring of the system.  We acknowledge that this must be in place and I acknowledge the importance of the rich resource of water.  However, there are two or three matters on which I seek further clarification.  Do the rural group water schemes fall within this?<\/p> <p>  Second, we are aware of the 25 cu. m threshold.  Somebody mentioned small water extractors earlier.  There are many small farmers who may have wells or be in a group water scheme.  Some of them may have a number of wells because where some were not successful they have bored a second and third well.  Then there is the net cumulative effect of all that extraction.  How does one monitor that?<\/p> <p>  I am also conscious of the importance of water in the horticulture industry.  I am familiar with a number of people who draw water from rivers.  That has other potential problems, but they screen that water and regularly test it because they do not know how it might be contaminated up the line or down the line and the impact of that on the crops.  In north County Dublin there is an enormous amount of glasshouse production and salad production in the horticulture sector.  In Wicklow and other places there is the forestry sector.  It draws water and uses different sources and mechanisms for doing so.  Of course, every farmer is drawing large amounts of water from a number of sources.<\/p> <p>  I am interested to hear about how the rural group water schemes interplay in all this.  More important, I wish to hear about the Department's engagement with, and feedback from, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA.  Perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh will give some points or headings on that.  Clearly, they would be very exercised about this.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh might give us a flavour of the responses he has had from those two organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020102000002#O00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603148400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Regarding rural group water schemes, any entity that abstracts water will come within the remit of the scheme.  There are no particular exemptions.  If a scheme is further than the registration threshold, which it undoubtedly would be, it requires licensing.  That is the case.<\/p><p>Similarly with farmers, if they breached the abstraction limits of 25 cu. m, they would be obliged to register.<\/p><p> On the issue of the cumulative effects, the registration and licensing system is required to give us more information.  There is a paucity of information about the impact of abstractions.  As I stated earlier, 6% is what the EPA considers.  As we introduce and develop the system, there will be an increased amount of information.  That will then inform the EPA as to how to judge cumulative effects.  If it gets additional information about a water volume that might be under stress, then that will bring to its attention whether particular abstraction points add to pressure.  It is part of building a picture and we do not have the full picture at the moment.<\/p><p> With regard to abstraction for horticulture, similarly, if they reach their thresholds, they must register and obtain a licence.  It is important to note that producers also have obligations under food safety standards in terms of the production of safe products.  There would be separate health and food safety rules for producing food.  The water quality for crop irrigation is absolutely crucial and it must be ensured that the water is not contaminated in a way that would affect food production.  It is similar to public water supplies where the EPA is responsible for environmental monitoring and ensuring that local authorities, Irish Water and others adhere to environmental limits.  The HSE also has a role in ensuring that water is safe from a public health point of view.  Accordingly, boil water notices will issue where the HSE considers water is unsafe.  There is a dual role.  Similarly for food producers, they have dual obligations to meet.<\/p><p> On the IFA and the ICMSA, I do not have a breakdown between the two submissions.  I know, however, that the farming sector was anxious to avoid the threshold limits being reduced, for example, from 25 cu. m to a lower limit.  They would have made those points clear in their submissions.  While there is a different emphasis between the two, I cannot quote them exactly.

Many have raised the issue of it being a finite resource and that overabstraction can have negative impacts on other users of the same water body, groundwater or surface water.<\/p> <p>  Is it the abstractor or the EPA that deems an extraction to be temporary and notifiable?

If an abstraction point is already there, was granted previously and has been running for quite some time, must someone retrospectively go back and apply an environmental impact to that or would it come under something along the lines of a substitute consent that one would have in planning?
