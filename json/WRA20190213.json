Emergency care orders are only granted by the Courts where there is an immediate threat to the safety of a child.  Social workers seeking an Emergency Care Order are often acting to protect a child during a crisis. <\/p>  <p>  Information from the Child Care Law Reporting Project indicates that Emergency Care Orders are the least commonly sought Order. They are also the Order of shortest duration, lasting a maximum of 8 days.<\/p>  <p>  Section 13 of the Child Care Act 1991 specifies the circumstances required for an Emergency Care Order to be granted. The operation of Section 13 by Tusla social workers was raised by Dr Geoffrey Shannon in his audit of how the Garda use their powers under Section 12 of the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 12 allows the Garda remove a child from a situation of acute risk.  The child is then transferred to Tusla which undertakes an assessment of the child&rsquo;s situation.  Tusla may return the child home, if their situation is deemed safe, or apply for an Emergency Care Order under section 13 of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that there has been no empirical work on applications being made to the Courts under section 13 by social workers. I was sufficiently concerned about the lack of data on this crucial practice issue that I requested Tusla to commission research on the topic. <\/p>  <p>  The research is being undertaken by NUIG and comprises a quantitative and qualitative methodology. The quantitative aspect is based on a unique database, created by extracting key information on every Section 12 case on record in Tusla for the 12 month period from 1 July 2016-to the end of June, 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The qualitative aspect of NUIG's research involves interviews with social workers and key Tusla personnel involved in applications for Emergency Care Orders, to identify the factors contributing to practice decisions at this point. <\/p>  <p>  The research report will integrate the two methodological approaches to identify key findings. I expect the report to be finalised by the end of June.

I have secured an additional &euro;110m for the Agency since becoming Minister with the intention of securing permanent staff resources.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Tusla has been unable to meet its additional whole time equivalent target each year since its establishment in 2014.  The failure to meet its targets include the reality that there is a limited supply of social workers in Ireland and this has contributed to making the achievement of these targets very challenging.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the number of vacant posts, Tusla has informed me that 320 posts are currently accepted by candidates and a further 569 approved permanent and temporary posts are at various stages of the recruitment process in various grade categories. In this context and to ensure continuity of service, Tusla uses agency staff. I understand at end December 2018, Tusla had 499 agency staff and 226 of these were social workers.<\/p>  <p>  I remain very concerned by the growth in expenditure on temporary agency staff in recent years and I have communicated this to Tusla. Notwithstanding this, given the front line nature of Tusla&rsquo;s services, it is accepted that agency staff will always be required. <\/p>  <p>  In a sense the need may have grown somewhat in recent years with the significant increase in referrals, new legislation with regard to mandatory reporting and the development of new services.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that all agency staff are actively encouraged to apply for Tusla&rsquo;s rolling campaigns for temporary and permanent positions across all grades. However, it must be acknowledged that some individuals prefer the flexibility of agency work.<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment and retention of social workers and residential social care workers for special care are two of the biggest challenges for Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  There are only 200-250 social work graduates each year. It is a very competitive labour market with a variety of services recruiting such as geriatric services, disability, mental health and of course child and family services. While there are many more social care graduates each year it is a small cohort that is willing to work in the particularly challenging environment of special care.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, Tusla continues to take a proactive approach to recruitment with the use of bespoke campaigns, visiting campuses in Ireland and abroad, personally engaging with students registering their interest in Tusla, assisting applicants with CORU registration and running rolling recruitment campaigns.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the supply of social workers, Tusla recently participated in a meeting hosted by my Department with key social work education stakeholders to influence the future supply of key personnel such as social workers. The first area to be examined will be social work student placements with a view to supporting the provision of more training places.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Tusla has also focussed on recruiting supporting grades such as clerical administration staff to ensure social workers can focus on their core tasks. I understand Tusla&rsquo;s forthcoming Multi-annual Strategic Workforce Plan will build on this further over the coming years. The Plan will identify the future composition of Tusla&rsquo;s workforce and I expect this plan will provide the basis for the establishment of achievable recruitment targets once it has been piloted in one or two service areas.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, Tusla employee turnover for all grades was 5.07% versus 6.68% for the same period in 2017. This reflects the recent work Tusla has undertaken to address retention issues. It is expected that a robust retention strategy will also form a pillar of the forthcoming workforce plan&rsquo;s implementation to reduce the turnover rate further and ensure better outcomes for Tusla&rsquo;s total whole time equivalent staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[7073\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes has not been published.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes has issued four interim reports to date.

A national evaluation of the ABC programme was carried out by the Centre for Effective Services (CES) and the published reports are now available on the DCYA website.   <\/p>  <p>  In November 2017, my Department initiated a process, in consultation with key ABC Programme stakeholders, to consider options for sustaining the work of the ABC Programme within a new vision for a community based prevention and early intervention programme from 2019 and beyond. Following these consultations, the decision was taken to transfer the current ABC Programme to Tusla, from September 2019 as part of the national Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme (PPFS).<\/p>  <p>  A working group was established in May 2018 to support the transition into this new national structure that can build on the achievements to date in both the ABC and PPFS Programmes, and strengthen Tusla&rsquo;s prevention and early intervention operations. As part of this national structure, it will take a renewed focus on addressing child poverty and inform the delivery of prevention and early intervention initiatives, improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Embedding the ABC programme and the learning from same within a wider infrastructure is key to strengthening local community based responses. It should also be recognised that the learning from the ABC and a range of other prevention programmes has been taken on by the What Works Programmes led by my Department. This is a programme that looks at enhancing quality and capacity building in the area of prevention and early intervention to effect change at systems level. It focuses on the area of information, evidence, capacity and quality development.<\/p>  <p>  Moving on both of these fronts: locally, through strengthening the ABC and PPFS programmes; and nationally, through the What Works initiative, is crucial in us embedding and transferring best practice in a strategic and sustainable way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Affordable Childcare Scheme","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[6985\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the affordable childcare schemes available to low and middle-income families; the status of the new affordable childcare scheme that was first announced in 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>In recent years, I have secured significantly increased investment in early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC) services.

The legislation supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions. A Regulatory Impact Analysis was conducted as part of the ACS development.<\/p>  <p>  The ACS, when introduced, will represent a major landmark for all children and families in Ireland, and especially for lower income families and lone parents. International reports have stated that ACS will significantly address affordability for lower income families, with analysis showing that Ireland will, for example, change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for childcare for lone parents, to 11th position. This will also have strong financial benefits for the childcare sector.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will also increase accessibility, in particular, by providing a coherent and progressive system of income-related subsidies.  By contrast, under the existing targeted schemes, subsidies are dependent on parents being in receipt of certain social welfare payments or a medical card or participating in particular training programmes. <\/p>  <p>  Consistent with enhancing accessibility, the scheme is designed to be flexible.  It acknowledges that childcare needs differ widely across different families. It reflects the fact that parents and providers currently agree the childcare arrangements, based on a combination of parental need and what the service can reasonably provide.  Under the scheme, parents and providers can continue to agree childcare requirements amongst themselves.  The scheme will then pay subsidies towards the cost of the agreed childcare arrangements up to a maximum number of hours per week.  It will remain a matter for childcare providers themselves to set their own fees and determine their own admission policies.<\/p>  <p>  Subsidies under the ACS will be paid subject to a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the scheme will contain rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is absent or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  These rules will be child-centred, fair and proportionate, clear and consistent.  They will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  They will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances. At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.  <\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive programme of information, training and supports for providers, parents and other stakeholders will shortly be rolled out.  Training for providers will be tailored and timed to suit the needs of busy childcare providers, and will include full details of Scheme rules. It is hoped that the extensive information and training will reassure providers re the reasonableness of the scheme, part of which was informed by focus groups and user testing with providers and parents. Details of the information and training programme will be communicated in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":61,"content":"<p>Question No. 58 answered with Question No. 34.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB05300"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[7144\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB05400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the actions and timelines for implementation of actions undertaken pursuant to the conclusions of the Charleton report relating to Tusla; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>While the third interim report from the Disclosures Tribunal was, as Mr Justice Charleton observed, primarily about holding policing to account, the report does make direct criticisms of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

Existing services that only provide school-age childcare will have 3 months in which to apply for registration with Tusla. A person who proposes to set up a new service will be required to apply for registration at least 3 months before commencing the service.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations, including the minimum ratio requirement of 1 adult to 12 children, were developed following the advice of the School Age Childcare Standards Working Group, which in 2018 submitted proposals for school-age childcare standards. Membership of the Group included representatives from across the school-age childcare sector. In developing their proposals, the Working Group reviewed international evidence and practice. The Group was reconvened for a further meeting with officials  in September 2018, during drafting of the Regulations, for consultation specifically on the adult-child ratio and outdoor space requirements. Their work followed that of a previous Expert Group led by the Department of Justice and Equality in 2005 which at that time recommended a ratio of 1 adult to 8 children.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that some services may require additional time to adjust to the minimum ratio of 1 adult to 12 children. Officials in my Department have had discussions on this issue recently with a number of sector representatives. As a result of these consultations, I have decided to extend the commencement date of the minimum ratio requirements by six months. This will mean that existing services will be given until 18th August to become fully compliant with these specific requirements, irrespective of the date on which they register with Tusla. I propose to sign the necessary Regulations to give this effect in advance of 18th February. The Regulations are subject to the consent of the Ministers for Education and Skills and Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p>  <p>  School age childcare services will continue to be eligible for the existing funding schemes (CCSP, TEC, etc) until the Affordable Childcare Scheme will replace them. Capital funding of &euro;1 million will also be made available to support the expansion of an existing school age childcare service or to set up a new school age childcare facility where demand is currently not being met at a local level. Services may be standalone or part of an early learning and care service.<\/p>  <p>  Public consultation is planned this summer in advance of the development of a fuller set of Regulations that will replace the initial Regulations and cover additional quality objectives. The Comprehensive Regulations will set out minimum requirements for the health, safety, welfare and development of children attending school-age childcare services. A key priority will be the development of an appropriate qualification for the school-age childcare workforce. First 5, which was published in November 2018, committed to requiring that all school-age childcare staff hold a minimum qualification, with the level of qualification to be determined by the end of 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB05900"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[6986\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB06000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to a new campaign (details supplied) by an organisation and its five key demands relating to food poverty, health, exclusion, education and housing; the way in which she plans to respond to same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>I am aware of this new campaign and the five key demands in relation to food poverty, health, exclusion, education and housing. <\/p>  <p>  These key issues highlighted during the campaign involve various Government Departments. My Department works closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has the lead role in co-ordinating strategies on poverty and the National Plan for Social Inclusion, but reducing poverty among children and others, also involves the Department of the Department of Education and the Department of Health, among others. We are adopting a cross Government approach which is for the benefit of children.<\/p>  <p>  This work  is reflected through the comprehensive policy framework Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, led by my Department, and underpinned by actions which are making a real difference on the ground for children, including those most vulnerable.  <\/p>  <p>    The &lsquo;Whole-of-Government Approach to Tackling Child poverty&rsquo; paper, published in 2017, involved the active input of the National Advisory Council for children and young people and other key non-governmental organisations.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, the Government set a child-specific poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two-thirds on 2011 levels by 2020.   <\/p>  <p>  This target has been actioned through a whole-of-Government approach.  The plan identifies six priority area for actions, namely: 1) providing universal access to general practitioner care for those under 18 years; 2) reducing the cost of education; 3) housing; 4) affordable childcare; 5) labour activation; and 6) the provision of in-work benefits. My own focus has been on affordable childcare.<\/p>  <p>  In my portfolio as Minister for Children, I have had the opportunity to secure significant public investment in high quality, affordable childcare and early learning.  The annual investment has increased by 117% since 2015.  Our early years schemes operate on policy that provide the highest level of subsidization to families with the lowest incomes. <\/p>  <p>  I believe it is important that we have progress indicators that accurately reflect the policy interventions and the improvements they are delivering.  <\/p>  <p>  The latest data from the 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) shows a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate for children, which decreased from 10.9% in 2016 to 8.8% in 2017, a reduction of just over 2 percentage points, and is the second highest reduction in the rate since the collection of SILC data began in 2004. This equates to a drop of 24,000 children living in consistent poverty over that 12-month period.<\/p>  <p>  I have continually emphasised the importance of eradicating child poverty and hunger and that collective and cross-sectoral action is critical in ensuring policy impact.  <\/p>  <p>   In November 2018, I hosted a high level workshop focusing on child poverty  which deliberated on how the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework could help to end child poverty and hunger in Ireland.  The workshop attended by senior officials from all Government Departments represented at the BOBF Consortium, the BOBF Advisory Council, ESRI and other research centres, the civil society and academia resonated the importance of eradicating child poverty and hunger as well as the need for cross-Government work to achieve this. <\/p>  <p>  This cross-Government approach will continue and we will redouble our efforts to continue with the progress made in the recent years. <\/p>  <p>  It is my intention to meet with the Chief Executive of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance in the coming weeks to discuss this campaign and how we can continue to focus on and address these important issues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges Provision","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB06200"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[6781\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300076#WRB06300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of refuge spaces for abuse victims here; the level of funding for the services; if additional funding or resourcing is required; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1362","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>I have secured additional funding of &euro;1.5 million for Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) services in 2019.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders.<\/p>  <p>  The above said, however, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants. In this regard, the initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  The second phase of the CIWG, under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, culminated in the issuing of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018.  This report acknowledges that many of the difficulties being faced by business are also impacting upon by community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  It makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, detailed in an Action Plan with agreed timelines for implementation.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent Progress Update was published last November and shows that 18 of the 19 actions points arising up to end of Q3 2018 have been completed.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the next quarterly Progress Update will issue by the end of this month and I understand that the vast majority of the total of 26 action points which were due for completion during 2018 overall have been done.  I am confident that any outstanding action points will be completed in the coming months, along with the three remaining action points with deadlines set for various quarters throughout 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The actions implemented to date cut across a number of different areas and include:<\/p>  <p>  - The publication of by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the &ldquo;Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo; <\/p>  <p>  - The Law Reform Commission confirming that the subject of caps on damages for personal injuries litigation is included in its draft Fifth Programme of Law Reform<\/p>  <p>  - Sections 8 &amp;amp; 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 have been amended to ensure defendants are appropriately notified of a claim having been submitted against their policy and to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, respectively<\/p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commencing the collection of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system<\/p>  <p>  - The Courts Service confirming that they will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the CIWG will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and voluntary and other organisations alike, and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300077#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Enforcement Activity","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300077#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[7234\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300077#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if hangars at Dublin Airport leased by private persons and-or companies are inspected by authorised officers and-or the Revenue Commissioners enforcement staff; if the content on board the aircraft in these hangars are eligible for self-clearance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>As daa has statutory responsibility for the management and operation of Dublin Airport, I have forwarded your question to the Company for direct reply.

Indeed, the Department of Finance has been to the forefront in assessing the impact of Brexit on our economy- commissioning joint research with the ESRI on the issue, including before the actual referendum. What is clear from this research and other studies is that the harder the Brexit the more negative the impact on Ireland. This analysis has focused on assessing the impact on the overall economy along with and identifying the sectors which are most exposed. These studies do not provide a detailed analysis by region. However, they do show that the most negative effects are likely to be felt in the agri-food and indigenous manufacturing sectors. <\/p>  <p>  While my Department&rsquo;s central economic and fiscal planning scenario remains an orderly exit involving the UK leaving with a transition arrangement in place, the risk of a disorderly exit has increased in recent weeks. As part of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing contingency planning for a no deal Brexit, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s initial assessment of the economic and fiscal impact of &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit was released on the 29th January 2019. In a disorderly exit, while in aggregate terms, the economy is likely to continue expanding, the pace of growth would be lower than is currently expected. <\/p>  <p>  The initial assessment by my Department suggests that the level of economic activity will be around 4&frac14; percentage points lower than our existing trajectory over the medium-term and will be around 6 percentage points lower compared to a &lsquo;no Brexit&rsquo; scenario. This aggregate assessment incorporates an even larger impact on economic activity in labour-intensive sectors such as agri-food and indigenous small and medium-sized enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  This assessment is based an initial application of the latest UK estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the UK equivalent of our ESRI. The Department and ESRI are preparing a more comprehensive update of their original work and the results will be published later this quarter. This output will be incorporated in the Stability Programme Update due to be published in April. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that such estimates may not capture the full impact, and the figures may be conservative. Indeed, the impact in certain exposed sectors and regions will be worse than the average.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, it is important to point out that Ireland is facing the challenge of Brexit in a robust economic position, with the highest GDP growth in Europe and record employment levels. In addition, exports, job creation, inflation and public debt indicators are all strong. This will provide a stable platform for the external challenges that lie ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Since the referendum result in 2016, we have been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy so that we have the capacity to deal with adverse economic shocks. This includes building up our Fiscal Buffers &ndash; by balancing our books and reducing our debt burden - and establishing the Rainy Day Fund. The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy and the 10-year National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, recent budgets have introduced specific initiatives, such as loan supports for agri-businesses and SMEs, aimed at supporting those businesses most affected by Brexit. The Government will continue to work to improve the business environment &ndash; to make it more competitive, to assist exporters to diversify markets, and to provide better infrastructure. That is the key to addressing the type of economic uncertainties which arise from Brexit.

The purpose of the scheme is to provide support by way of a cash grant, to established, smaller-scale, non-mainstream music education\/community music initiatives with limited or no access to other forms of public funding. Grants are not intended for use on capital expenditure such as structural\/building costs, but can be used for instruments. Award of the bursary is done based on published criteria. The scheme was first established in 2016 and continued in both 2017 and 2018. An announcement regarding the Bursary in 2019 will be made in the coming weeks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300078#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300078#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[7386\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300078#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there will be no changes to the structure or layout of a former military installation (details supplied) pending resolution of the terms of the British exit from the European Union and a full appraisal of the security requirements of the Army and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Border region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>In March 2012, Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board (CMETB), acquired the former D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill Army barracks with a view to centralise their further education and training service provision and create opportunities for expansion.

Where applicants are absent from the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding the date of their application the policy of the Minister is to only grant a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied that the travel was demonstrably unavoidable or due to exceptional circumstances.

That notice can be accessed at the following link:<\/p><p>EU Council Regulation 2201\/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (also known as the Brussels II bis or the Brussels IIa Regulation) provides for EU judicial co-operation and recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border matrimonial matters.  This will be affected by the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union since, absent a withdrawal agreement that covers these areas post-Brexit, the UK will essentially become a third country.  Among the areas of family law covered by this instrument are foreign divorce recognition, child abduction and custody of, and access to, children.<\/p><p>A person who is, or is likely to be, relying upon this Regulation in a cross-border family law case involving the UK on or after the withdrawal date of 29 March should consider seeking legal advice as to how the withdrawal may impact upon the circumstances of his or her particular case.<\/p><p>In some areas of family law, there are international conventions that will apply to proceedings involving Ireland and the UK and which will provide a substitute for the existing EU Regulation.  The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction will continue to apply as between Ireland and the UK.  The 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children will also continue to apply.<\/p><p>Insofar as the recognition in Ireland of divorces obtained in the UK is concerned, the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 sets out the circumstances in which a divorce granted in a non-EU jurisdiction on or after 2 October 1986 will be recognised.  Under section 5 of the 1986 Act, a divorce shall be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled at the date of the institution of the divorce proceedings.  Thus in a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit scenario, the UK will in effect become a non-EU jurisdiction and the basis for recognition in Ireland of divorces obtained in the UK will, under the 1986 Act as it now is,  become domicile as opposed to the current position under the relevant EU regulation, which is habitual residence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300079#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300079#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[7269\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300079#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 109 to 111, inclusive, of 7 November 2018, if all direct provision centres are complying with his instructions as set out in the response that they should provide feminine hygiene products to residents; the way in which this instruction has been communicated; and the follow-up work carried out to ensure that each direct provision centre is in compliance.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>Following the commitment that I gave in the House in November 2018, all managers in accommodation centres were emailed and advised that those centres who are not operating the independent living model should supply feminine hygiene products to female residents at no cost on request.  <\/p>  <p>  I have instructed my Department to ensure that information in relation to the supply of feminine hygiene products is widely communicated. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that in conjunction with the roll out of the public procurement programme throughout the state, more centres are moving to the independent living model which allows residents to procure through a weekly points system all of their shopping requirements in relation to food, toiletries and personal hygiene products.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300079#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300079#WRE01800"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[7286\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300079#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an application for citizenship and supporting documentation, including original passport, birth certificate and public services card, in the case of a person (details supplied), which was sent on 12 December 2018, has been received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":197,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy has been received, however it was not accompanied by the prescribed application fee.<\/p>  <p>  A letter issued to the person concerned on 8 February 2019, returning the original documents and requesting the fee and certain other documentation and a reply is awaited.

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.   <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service.  <\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018) to enable the Director of the Decision Support Service to progress the preparation of the codes of practice as soon as the multi-disciplinary group submits its recommendations to the Director.   <\/p>  <p>  The remainder of the 2015 Act has not yet been commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the Decision Support Service has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020, the situation is being kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300080#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300080#WRF00475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300080#WRF00450"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[7171\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300080#WRF00475","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of reports commissioned from firms (details supplied) in 2018; the firm that completed each report; and the cost of each report..

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers. My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, I reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under 3 months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 &ndash; this has brought greater equity to the inspection fee regime. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, live exports of cattle increased by over 30% to 246,000 head compared to the previous year. This change was driven by an increase in exports to other EU countries &ndash; particularly calf exports. This growth trend has increased into 2019, with live exports totalling 5,000 in the first four weeks of the year &ndash; a 25% increase on the same period in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The live export market to third countries slowed in 2018 - in large part due to fluctuations in the Turkish Lira. The current restrictions in Turkey seek to reduce the pressure in its own domestic market. My Department will continue to engage with the Turkish authorities in an effort to see the resumption of live cattle trade at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  New health certificates for the export of cattle to Libya were agreed in November 2018, which increase the range of cattle that can be exported there.  My Department is also engaging with the Egyptian authorities to secure the finalisation of agreement on three proposed health certs for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle.    In January of this year, my Department reached agreement with Qatar on a health cert for the export of sheep for slaughter.  I have extended an invitation to my Algerian counterpart to visit Ireland in early 2019. This follows earlier contact with Algeria, to try and reach agreement on revised and separate slaughter, fattening and breeding certs.<\/p>  <p>  Despite these many positive developments for live export markets, I am also well aware of the challenges faced by the sector, including transport capacity and lairage capacity at Cherbourg. My Department officials visited Cherbourg in September last year to discuss the capacity issue with French officials and local lairage owners. My officials continue to meet with ferry companies to explore new routes to continental Europe or the potential for carrying livestock on existing routes, and to ensure that the greatest facilitation possible is afforded to livestock exporters in the important Spring period.  The pending approval of a new ferry will contribute to addressing capacity issues.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2019  my Department will continue to facilitate growth in live exports, seeking out new markets and facilitating trade by reaching agreement on health certification. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300082#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":327,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300082#WRH02200"},{"type":"question","counter":328,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[7208\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300082#WRH02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the plans he will present to the EU agriculture Commissioner and the EU trade Commissioner regarding the need to protect farming interests here in negotiations concerning a proposed Mercosur trade deal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":329,"content":"<p>From an Irish perspective, we have been very consistent in urging caution in the EU's approach to the Mercosur negotiations, which present a very particular threat to the Irish and European beef sectors in particular. <\/p>  <p>  Our position has been reiterated many times, for example by myself and by my colleague, Minister Andrew Doyle, at Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings, and by other Ministers in the relevant EU Trade policy fora.

The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy within the Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.<\/p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.<\/p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas, including in County Kerry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300082#WRH03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300082#WRH04000"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[7164\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300082#WRH04100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding the provision of broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":344,"content":"<p>The premises referred to by the Deputy is in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at www.broadband.gov.ie.

Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), which took over the functions of FETAC (the Further Education and Training Awards Council), is the awarding body for further education awards in Ireland and is also responsible for the NFQ.  Access to programmes of learning which lead to QQI-accredited awards are widely available through a variety of education and training providers nationwide. <\/p><p>The 2016 Childcare Regulations (Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016) came into effect at the end of June 2016. A specific section of the regulations deals with the matter of qualifications for Early Learning and Care workers who are working with children in a pre-school service.  This section of the regulations took effect for new services from 30<sup>th<\/sup>June 2016 and for all other services it took effect after 31<sup>st<\/sup>December 2016. It states (Part 3, 9.4) that each employee working directly with children attending the service must hold at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the NFQ or a qualification deemed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to be equivalent.<\/p><p>This regulatory change was introduced following many years of consultation with the sector. Mindful of the challenge that it would present to the sector, my department introduced the following supportive measures:<\/p><p>-  Learner Funds to provide sector workers with an opportunity to upskill to a Level 5 qualification. Three Learner Funds were available to upskill to Level 5, the most recent with a closing date for applications of July 29<sup>th<\/sup>2016. The courses undertaken through the Learner Funds were wholly funded by my Department via the City \/ County Childcare Committees (CCCs).<\/p><p>-  A &lsquo;grandfathering declaration&rsquo;, to allow sector workers nearing the end of their career to continue working. The option to apply for a grandfathering declaration was first made available in the latter half of 2014, and publicised through the CCCs. Early Years sector workers were able to avail of the grandfathering declaration up to the time that the regulations came into effect. Grandfathering declarations signed after the 30<sup>th<\/sup>of June 2016 are not considered valid, and this time limit is stated in the Regulations. The grandfathering declarations apply up to the start of September 2021, allowing signatories to meet the minimum regulatory standard until that time.<\/p><p>-  Delayed introduction of regulations. Following consultation with various stakeholders regarding regulatory change, the introduction of regulations was extended from September 2015 to June 2016. The date for the minimum qualification standard to take effect was extended beyond this to the 31<sup>st<\/sup>of December 2016. The sector was first informed about the intention to introduce new regulations, including a minimum qualification standard, in 2013. <\/p><p>-  A qualifications assessment procedure put in place by my Department in the latter half of 2015, which allows for applications to be made for individual assessment; applicants may include any documentation they believe to be relevant and assessment is made on the basis of the entire qualifications profile as evidenced by the applicant. This is conducted by officials in my Department in consultation with the Early Years Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, and is available to anyone who applies. Each application is dealt with on a case by case basis. <\/p><p>If the Deputy is referring to a specific case, I would advise that individual to apply to my Department for qualifications recognition, if they have not already done so.  If they want to pursue additional education, they should contact an appropriate education provider and enquire directly with them as to their options. Some education providers may be able to provide advanced access to a programme of learning on foot of pre-existing qualifications or a Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) process. <\/p><p>I must emphasise that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is neither an education and training provider, nor an awarding body, and cannot issue instruction to educational institutions in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300084#WRK03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300084#WRK03400"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[7172\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300084#WRK03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of reports commissioned from firms (details supplied) in 2018; the firm that completed each report; and the cost of each report.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[7189\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300084#WRK03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of consultants from firms (details supplied) contracted to perform work in 2018; and the amount spent on consultants from each firm.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.<\/p><p>My Department commissioned one report in 2018 by Deloitte and Touche, which cost &euro;8,781.  <\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills, the national authority for the Erasmus+ programme, is required by the EU to produce, on an annual basis, an independent audit of the monies provided to Leargas.

The Commission is tasked with providing a full account of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions. Following a request from the Commission, Government granted an extension to the time frame for the delivery of its final Report. The Commission is due to report in February 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The scope of the Commission&rsquo;s remit includes several specific areas of practice and procedure in the care, welfare, entry arrangements and exit pathways for the women and children who were residents of 14 named institutions and the representative sample of County Homes identified by the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is satisfied that this independent Commission has sufficient scope to examine the broad range of public concerns, and to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and where appropriate to make any recommendations to Government which the Commission deems necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 provides an effective mechanism to investigate complex and sensitive matters of significant public concern. The Act gives the Commission robust powers to compel persons to produce information and answer questions. It is important to recognise that a statutory Commission is fully independent in the conduct of its investigations. The precise approach to examination of evidence are matters for the Commission to decide and progress. <\/p>  <p>  The approach being taken provides a clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in Mother and Baby Homes. Accordingly, the Terms of Reference focus on these institutions.<\/p>  <p>  While the Magdalene Laundries did not function as Mother and Baby Homes, their role as entry and exit pathways will be examined and these institutions are also included in the Social History module of the Commission's work. A restorative justice ex-gratia scheme was established for former residents of these Laundries, however this scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  In its Second Interim Report the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes made a recommendation that the decision to exclude unaccompanied children who were resident in Mother and Baby Homes, including the Bethany Home, from the Residential Institutions Redress Act should be re-examined by Government. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills is responsible for the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 legislation and related arrangements. I understand that the redress scheme established under the act has not been extended to any additional institution since 2005 and related issues have been considered by previous Government's on a number of occasions.<\/p>  <p>  In its examination of these matters in 2017, the Government decided it was not possible to consider any such arrangements in advance of the findings and conclusions of the Commission on relevant matters. When the Commission delivers its final report, its conclusions on all matters regarding the treatment of former residents of Mother and Baby Homes will be taken into careful consideration when determining the State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300085#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300085#WRL02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300085#WRL02800"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[7240\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300085#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the person or body that has responsibility for managing the interment of a person who dies with no assets and no family;

The same rationale would not apply to widowed people of working age, who in many cases receive both income from employment and their Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension.  It is also the case that our social protection system, like most developed countries, generally provides higher rates of payment for those above pension age than for those of working age.  For example, people moving from Jobseekers Allowance to State Pension (non-contributory) can expect a significant increase in their weekly rate of payment, upon reaching state pension age.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposal to increase the rate of payment for widows\/widowers\/surviving civil partners under 66 to that of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory) would result in a significant additional cost that would have to be met from either increased PRSI or Exchequer subvention or a reduction in the general rate of payments, and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300086#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Websites","counter":488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300086#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[7314\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300086#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the amount spent on a system (details supplied) relating to the website of her Department.","asker":"1276","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>There were no payments made by my Department in relation to its website to the company referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300086#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation Funding","counter":491,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300086#WRM02000"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[7316\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021300086#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if there is provision to provide financial assistance to a family under the supplementary welfare allowance, rent allowance scheme or other schemes to cover the cost of accommodation in cases in which the family has been refused access to the housing waiting list by virtue of having no fixed abode; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>The primary responsibility for provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with local authorities.
