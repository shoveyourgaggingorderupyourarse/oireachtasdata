A comparable investment has taken place at farm level.  The co-operative and multi-purpose nature of the Irish dairy industry has ensured that it has developed a significant degree of vertical integration with its farmer members, and it surrounds and supports them with the systems and expertise to deliver on safe and sustainable food production.  Included in this support is a huge investment in milk quality, built on animal health and welfare, including the responsible usage of all veterinary medicines.  This reflects on the strategic importance of the dairy co-operative sector as a key partner of the Government in delivering on shared objectives for the public good in animal health and welfare, food safety, climate change, water quality and other objectives.  It is in this context that we raise some significant concerns regarding the implementation of the new EU veterinary medicines regulation and the fertiliser register.<\/p> <p>  ICOS previously addressed the committee in spring 2021 on the issue of veterinary medicines.  Unfortunately, we find ourselves in a position where our key concerns remain unaddressed.  We said previously that the new veterinary medicines regulation could potentially create a dramatic shift in the veterinary medicines supply chain in favour of private veterinary practitioners and to the detriment of co-operatives, pharmacists and independent licensed merchants, LMs.  We warned that the new rules would narrow the distribution channel and reduce choice.  In turn, this would increase the costs of medicines, as co-operatives and LMs would be disadvantaged in the marketplace.  This will undermine the sustainability of the co-operative store network as a key pillar of its offering will be weakened and footfall will be diminished.  We stressed the need to find an appropriate legal solution.<\/p><p>Our main recommendation to the committee was to ensure the continuation of the existing LM network as a recognised route of supply, expertly administered by trained, responsible persons, to ensure maximum and fair competition and availability for farmers.  We repeat these concerns here today.<br\/><br\/>We have had in the meantime the opportunity to examine the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s proposal for a national veterinary prescribing system, NVPS, and the reaction of the veterinary profession through its representative body.  Since the new legislation and the new prescribing regime for antibiotics came into effect on 28<sup><\/sup>January 2022, we have seen the sales of intramammary antibiotics totally collapse across all co-ops.  Notwithstanding the shorter window for dispensing when it comes to antibiotics, this clearly indicates the negative impact on farmer choice of the introduction of a restrictive veterinary-only prescribing and de facto dispensing regime.  This is the canary-in-the-coalmine warning for everybody concerned about the plans by the Department to proceed with the decision to up-regulate antiparasitic veterinary medicines to prescription-only.<br\/><br\/>The advice from the Department is that the new electronic NVPS will provide adequate choice for farmers.  This is based on the assumption that all veterinary practitioners will collaborate with the Department and fully adopt the new system of prescribing.  This has simply not happened to date.  There is no evidence to suggest that the Department has been able to get vets to test the system, let alone operate it when it is up and running.  Co-ops have been left in limbo as a result, spending considerable resources on new IT upgrades for a system we do not even know will be operational.  We support the introduction of the new NVPS but for it to deliver on its potential it needs to work in parallel with a fit-for-purpose prescribing regime.<br\/><br\/>The Department has failed to address the possibility of legislating to allow for the continuation of the role of responsible persons as effective prescribers of antiparasitic medicines.  We call on the committee and Members of the Oireachtas to ensure the Department pursues all avenues that will enable responsible persons employed by co-ops and LMs to continue to do what they have been effectively doing for many years.  We understand it is legally possible to amend the 2007 legislation to retrospectively recognise and provide a legal basis for the ongoing role for responsible persons as prescribers of antiparasitic veterinary medicines.  Crucially, this will provide for alignment between the prescribing and dispensing regime on both sides of the Border, protecting our all-island animal health approach and preventing the risk of the development of an unnecessary and damaging black market for veterinary medicines.<br\/><br\/>The economic impact of what we now see evolving as a highly dysfunctional prescribing regime will result in a substantial loss of jobs in co-ops and LMs in rural areas the length and breadth of the country, and a significant increase in cost at farm level, at a time when inflation is going through the roof at co-op and farm level.  Co-ops and merchants have already been forced to invest significant funds in IT changes to sales software.  It is ironic, as what we have seen from the lesson of intramammaries is that we may not get to use this new software.  At the very least, the Department should be willing to assist with the financial burden associated with IT upgrades by providing an IT grant for the new NVPS and the fertiliser register, which we will mention later.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the need to fundamentally review the direction of the Department on the position of responsible persons, and to seek clarity on the advice it says it has received from the Office of the Attorney General in this respect, other issues need to be resolved with respect to any future prescribing regime.  First, in order to protect competition in the market, it is vital that the NVPS as it is being developed provides for the full availability of appropriate generic alternative medicines.  Second, the Department needs to legislate, as it did with SI 786 in 2007 for mastitis control programmes, to allow for vets working as part of an approved co-op herd health programme to establish and maintain a client-patient practice relationship, CPPR.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Carroll, who will speak on the fertiliser register<b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092800002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>ICOS has worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other stakeholders to deliver on our commitments to improve water quality and reduce emissions of harmful greenhouse gases and ammonia.  Our support is illustrated by the support of co-ops for a range of sustainability initiatives and programmes, such as the agricultural sustainability and support advisory programme, ASSAP, the signpost farm programme, joint Teagasc programmes and individual co-op programmes and incentives.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the development of the fertiliser register as a key measure in delivering on the above commitments as well as the commitments under Ag Climatise and Food Vision to reduce substantially the usage of chemical nitrogen and to make a significant switch to using protected urea, alongside improvements in soil fertility, clover and multispecies sward incorporation and precision use of slurry and low-emission spreading equipment.  To this end, we and our members have participated in the Department&rsquo;s consultative working group on the fertiliser register over the past number of months.  While there have been and continue to be technical concerns regarding software systems and other practical matters, the most substantive issue with the current proposal for a register is the acknowledgement by the Department that the register will only apply to purchases of fertiliser made within the State.<\/p> <p>  What the industry, the Department and stakeholders need is a seamless system, which will capture all the use of fertiliser within the State.  The ongoing capacity for farmers to purchase fertilisers from outside the State is an enormous black hole in the current plans for a register.  It would be extraordinarily naive to assume, given examples from other products, such as silage plastic and smoky coal, that similar loopholes will not be taken advantage of in this scenario.  We acknowledge the efforts of the Department to seek an all-island approach and we appreciate the sensitivities at play.  However, the lack of any clear timelines for a solution is very worrying.<\/p> <p>  ICOS and our members as well as stakeholders in the fertiliser supply chain are working with the Department to support the development of a fit-for-purpose register.  This process has not yet concluded, especially the full development of the IT system.  As such, it may be premature to comment on some of the technical aspects.  However, it is vital that the current IT systems in each co-op will work seamlessly with the Department&rsquo;s new register to ensure there is no unnecessary bureaucracy or inefficiency at co-op level when it comes to selling fertiliser.  There needs to be a significant communications campaign to inform farmers of what will be needed to ensure compliance with the new register, including the recording of closing and opening stocks for each year.  Farmers who are not proficient in IT skills will need support in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The development of a fit-for-purpose fertiliser register will be a key tool for the Department and industry to support farmers in making the right decisions in respect of our environmental commitments.  The full sharing of information between the Department and co-ops will be important in the implementation of the types of co-op sustainability programmes required by the marketplace and the Department.  ICOS supports the development of a register.   However, the current anomaly with respect to Northern Ireland is of great concern and must be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  As they quite rightly said, they have addressed this matter previously.  We have been here before and have gone through in detail all the potential pitfalls of what was on the table.  With that in mind, there is no need to go back over all that and rehash old ground.<\/p> <p>  I would like the representatives to elaborate a little more based on their experiences.  They have had experience of the NVPS and how it is working since January.  From reading their statement, they are saying in a couple of lines that the co-op market has collapsed somewhat.  I ask them to elaborate a little more on how that is affecting their businesses in specific instances.  Now that we have the draft Bill, which I assume they have read, what changes could be made within the proposed legislation to overcome that?<\/p> <p>  I would also like ICOS to elaborate a little more on the role of the responsible person, which it seemed to highlight as a potential solution to some, though possibly not all, of the problems its members are encountering under the present system.  From my perspective, and I found this in all our deliberations on this issue, there is a serious misconception out there about the relationship between antimicrobial resistance and antiparasitic resistance.  I get it and I see the importance of definitive control in respect of antimicrobial resistance because it can have effects on human health or whatever.  However, many people do not even realise the situation when they hear \"antiparasitic resistance\".  They correlate it with antimicrobial resistance and see it as being the same thing and a danger to humans, whereas antiparasitic resistance means the resistance of the parasite.<\/p><p>From reading ICOS's statement and from our previous meetings on this, and as a farmer, I believe that if we are to control that and get to the kernel of the antiparasitic resistance, that is, the resistance of the parasite, it is not just a veterinary opinion that is needed.  Rather, you need an overall picture of the farm, including the farming background, the land type and the farming habits.  In my opinion, in many cases the responsible person within the co-operative, of whom the farmer will be a regular user and from whom he or she will possibly get fertiliser and all the other products, would have a better knowledge of that farmer's farm, his or her farming practices and the other products he or she uses, whether the fertilisers of whatever.  The responsible person would probably be better positioned than the vet when it comes to antiparasitic resistance.  I would like to hear Mr. Doyle's opinion on that.<\/p><p> I take on board the role technology is going to play in both aspects of ICOS&rsquo;s submission, namely, those relating to the fertiliser register and the new medicines regulation.  How has the organisation been finding that technological interaction so far, since January?  With regard to the fertiliser issue, I agree 100%.  The major difficulty here relates to the fact the register is going to contain only the fertilisers purchased, but if someone can get 1 tonne or 2 tonnes across the Border or wherever, that is not going to be recorded.  That, in itself, defeats the whole purpose of the exercise, which is to address our nutrient input, improve our water quality and so on.  While that issue has been highlighted, what would Mr. Doyle suggest as a solution to that problem?  What would he see as a good system of recording what is spread, which would be simple enough, you would imagine, as opposed to what is purchased?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092800002#B00300","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I might take the antiparasitic questions and Mr. Carroll might take the fertiliser ones.  On the intermammary sales, according to the feedback to date from the co-operatives that have been involved in the sales of intermammary products, which have been operating successful mastitis control programmes to enable them to sell them legally since 2007, they have seen them completely collapse.  Some of the examples I was given by some of the major milk-producing co-operatives have indicated in excess of 90% less on a year-to-date basis running to 1 September has related to intermammary sales.<\/p> <p>  No doubt there has been some stockpiling or perhaps a reaction to farmers&rsquo; behaviour and so on, but that still does not explain the serious collapse.  If that is anything to go by, and all we can go by is the experience of what has happened in the past nine months, it will be a similar situation to the antiparasitic because they are a prescription-only medicine, POM, product that require a prescription from the veterinary prescriber.  We are now seeing quite clearly that the vet writes the prescription for the intermammary products and dispenses them, and we are simply excluded from that market.  That is a clear example of where we are.<\/p> <p>  Regarding figures and so on, as I said, it is in excess of 90%.

To return to one of the Senator's earlier questions, there is a clear differentiation between the use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance, AMR, on the one hand, and antiparasitic resistance, on the other.<\/p> <p>  While we can all rationalise a reduction in the use of antibiotics, and the co-operatives will be the first to say we have to greatly reduce the use of antibiotics in all food-producing animals because we all live in the same essential bacteria and we do not want resistance among humans, we cannot prescribe them.  Perhaps it is going in the direction of travel it should be, whereby it is in the hands of the visiting vet and the animal is treated within a day or two.  The use of antibiotics usually means there is an animal welfare issue or, potentially, a life-or-death scenario for an animal, and we would agree with the tight prescribing window.  Perhaps the fact we have lost that business is a blessing in disguise, although that is not the way I mean to communicate it, in that the use of antibiotics needs to be reduced greatly on that basis.  The same cannot be said, however, about antiparasitic products.  It is usually not a life-or-death scenario for the animal.  Rather, it is usually a loss of production and it is never so serious a situation that the product must be administered rapidly.  As well as that, antiparasitic resistance is not currently a human issue.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, as co-operatives, we are acutely aware of the loss of production we could face from our green grass-based production model by having widespread antiparasitic resistance, and our responsible persons - this too crosses over one of the Senator's questions - are best placed to ensure that resistance does not build up with these products.  Currently, when a person comes in for a product without a prescription, our responsible persons advise farmers on the active ingredient, the withdrawal period and the rotation of the product to ensure resistance does not occur.  Moreover, and this also goes back to another of the Senator's questions, they are acutely aware of the locality in which they are operating.  Some areas, for example, will have quite wet ground and there could be a lot of fluke issues.  There could be environmental issues that are unique to the area of which the responsible person will be acutely aware, which the private veterinary practitioner might not be aware of because he or she might call there infrequently.<\/p> <p>  There is a clear distinction between antibiotics and AMR, and antiparasitic resistance, APR.  We know that the responsible person is probably best placed to advise farmers on the use of antiparasitic in particular, and that is in no way meant to demean the veterinary profession.  It is a simple fact that the responsible persons have access to the data that enable them, as we described in our submission, to prescribe the correct product in the correct quantity at the correct time.<\/p> <p>  On the NVPS development to date and since January, that has been a slow process.  A handful of key software development companies cross over a lot of co-operatives, particularly dairy ones.  To date it has been challenged and somewhat hindered in its development in that there are many hurdles to get over that people might not have thought of, and development in that regard has been slow.<\/p> <p>  The greatest hurdle to the implementation of the NVPS will be the lack of engagement by the veterinary profession in trying to make this work.  It simply cannot work in the way it is currently operating, whereby the veterinary profession is more or less ignoring the system and not interacting with trying to make it work, which may be another clear demonstration that the responsible persons, through the co-operatives and their various software systems, are best placed to make it work.  They currently have the software in their development and they interact with the Department in trying to create a system that accurately reflects the usage and the monitoring of who has got it.  This system will probably be the template used for the fertiliser database as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>To return to the in-house vets issue, Mr. Doyle indicated the VCI guidelines or regulations are inhibiting that and not helping it work.

Legally, the vet cannot prescribe products until that has happened.  The co-operative vets we have in house would need to call to these farmers in advance of writing the prescription, but that would simply not be possible for the number of shareholders and farmers in most of the co-operatives.   That has completely hindered the process taking place to comply with the VCI regulations regarding that.<\/p> <p>  The old regulation that was in place in 2007 facilitated vets writing prescriptions, for antibiotics in particular, in a different fashion, whereby they were derogated from that.

We feel that much has been done and the register will show that.  We will find that almost all farmers will be compliant when the register gives the figures.  I am confident about that.  However, farmers who want to avoid the register can avoid it easily by trading fertiliser across the Border.  Fertiliser is traded both ways across the Border.  That is fully legal and compliant.  Farmers are doing nothing wrong by doing that.  That is happening today.  Traders throughout the country who trade straw might bring down a load of fertiliser and bring a load of straw back to the North.  That trade has been happening for years and is fully legitimate.

The terminology they are using is \"comparable products\" the farmer could be offered.  This was one of our early asks with the Department in the development of the NVPS.  Even at our most recent meeting a number of weeks back, it still had not been addressed.  I am told that they are now focused on it.  We are greatly alarmed that this could be greatly abused.  For example, if a veterinary practitioner was to prescribe a product that was only available through veterinary channels, we would be effectively out of the market because there would be no generic alternative.  What I mean by this is, the prescription must have the active ingredient, the percentage of it, the administration mode, and maybe the withdrawal period.  We are concerned that the potential for abuse would be great in that the percentage could be unique to veterinary channels and we would not have any available comparable product to offer, even though the active ingredient might be the same for.  For example, there are a large number of generic type products available for certain ivermectin-based products.  If, however, one created a product with a 3.16% weight-for-volume percentage, and it was only sold through veterinary channels given by the manufacturing company, nobody would have it.  Licensed merchants would not have access to it.  They would only have potentially a 5% product or 10% product, but that would not be comparable according to the NVPS.  We have asked the Department clearly that this requirement for the percentage needs to be removed, and that it would just be the active ingredient as well as the other parameters that should be on it, to ensure that the lack of competition does not arise.

Finally, I have received no apologies.<\/p> <p>  Today, we will discuss the costs of living, minimum wage increases and the report by the Low Pay Commission.  Most employees are entitled to the minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  Since 1 January 2022, the national minimum wage is &euro;10.50 per hour.  In July, the Low Pay Commission published its report and recommendations for the national minimum wage.  On 14 September, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, announced that he had received the Government's proposal to accept the recommendation by the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage by 80 cent to &euro;11.30 per hour from 1 January 2023.

I am glad to have the opportunity to meet with you all and discuss the commission&rsquo;s recent report and recommendations on the national minimum wage.<\/p> <p>  Mandate has also been invited to the meeting.  Since 2016, the accommodation and food, and the wholesale and retail sectors combined have consistently accounted for more than 50% of national minimum wage workers.  In 2020, they accounted for 54.4% of all national minimum wage workers.  Mandate&rsquo;s experience of their representation of retail, bar and administrative workers is always of interest to the Low Pay Commission and its contributions to the commission&rsquo;s consultations on minimum wage issues are always welcome.  I look forward to hearing its contributions to today&rsquo;s discussions.  <\/p> <p>  I was appointed as chair of the commission last October.  I started my working life with CIE and recently finished a seven-year term as chairman of Dublin Bus.  I run a management consultancy business that I established in 2008.  I have expertise in economics, industrial relations, employment law and human resources, both in the public and private sector, and act as an independent person in a number of other organisations.  The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 as an independent body.  Its statutory function pursuant to the National Minimum Wage Acts is to make recommendations to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage.  It is important to emphasise that the commission recommends a national minimum wage but the Government decides on the rate.  The legislation provides for the Government to accept and implement the commission&rsquo;s recommendation or to implement a different rate.  <\/p> <p>  The national minimum wage seeks to find a balance between a fair and sustainable rate for low-paid workers and one that will not have significant negative consequences for employment and competitiveness.  It might be useful for me to outline how the commission comes to its recommendations.  The commission comprises eight members and myself as an independent chair.  There are members who have an understanding of the interests of employees, especially the impact of living on the minimum wage and the sectors where low pay and minimum wage workers are concentrated.  There are members who have an understanding of the interests of employers, particularly small to medium-sized employers and those operating in traditionally low-pay sectors and who possess a good knowledge and understanding of the specific issues faced by Irish businesses particularly in respect of labour costs and competitiveness.  There are also academics who have particular knowledge and expertise in relation to economics, labour market economics and statistics.<\/p> <p>  The National Minimum Wage Acts set out the issues we are obliged to consider when we are making our recommendations.   These include the cost of living, earnings and income distribution, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.  Statute requires incremental adjustment to the national minimum wage.  The recommendations that the commission makes are always based on the best available evidence at the time.  The commission has a research partnership agreement with the ESRI to undertake and disseminate research on the issues surrounding low pay in Ireland.  This has led to the publication of high-quality research on the impact of changes to the national minimum wage.  The commission recently awarded research bursaries for two independent pieces of research on minimum wages issues.  This research is being finalised and its publication will further improve our understanding of the issues surrounding low pay.<\/p> <p>  Since my appointment last October, the commission has met 15 times.  Meetings are used to analyse the most recent research and data on low pay issues and on general economic performance.  We also met with representatives of the Department of Finance, OECD, UK Low Pay Commission, Eurofound, ESRI, Central Bank of Ireland, as well as academics from the University of Oxford and University College Dublin, to hear their expert opinion on issues relevant to our work.  We also received commissioned reports from the ESRI and Maynooth University, which provided analysis of the impact of changes in the minimum wage on several areas including employment and hours of work.  The commission also met with several representative groups representing both employers and employees, including Mandate.  As part of our deliberations the commission conducted a public consultation this year where we invited submissions on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage for 2023.  The commission received 297 submissions.  This contrasts with 85 submissions received last year and highlights the interest in and awareness of low-pay issues at this time.  These meetings and submissions provided further information and context for us to consider when it came to making our final recommendations.  <\/p> <p>  Our recommendation to the Government was for an 80 cent increase in the national minimum wage.  This represents a 7.6% increase and is the largest increase recommended by the commission to date.  This recommendation was supported by seven of the nine members of the commission.  Two of the three employee representative members dissented from the majority decision of an increase of 80 cent in the national minimum wage.  Those members sought a higher increase phased in in tranches beginning with a temporary increase in October 2022.  The Government recently announced that it had accepted the commission&rsquo;s recommendation and that the national minimum wage will rise to &euro;11.30 from 1 January 2023. <\/p> <p>  It is expected that more than 164,000 people will be in line for an increase based on our recommendation to increase the national minimum wage.  However, the real figure is likely to be much higher given that there will be a knock-on increase for those currently earning slightly above the minimum wage.  The commission&rsquo;s recommendation for 2023 equates to gross increases of approximately &euro;30 a week, &euro;120 a month or &euro;1,600 a year for those working full-time on the national minimum wage.  When we made our recommendation of a 7.6% increase in the national minimum wage inflation was predicted to be 4% in 2023 with wage growth predicted to reach 4.5%.  There are those who will say that this increase is not enough in a time of high inflation and others will say this increase is too much when employers are also facing high inflation and challenges to their competitiveness.  When coming to our recommendation we sought to make it fair, balanced and sustainable.  We examined our commissioned research from the ESRI and Maynooth University, which indicates that previous minimum wage increases recommended by the commission have had little effect on employment while reducing wage inequality.  These have been gradual increases and when we consider changes to the national minimum wage we have to make sure that we make changes in a way that does not give rise to a fall in the employment or a fall in hours worked.  To do so would be counterproductive.  This year&rsquo;s recommendations were made at a time the economy is grappling with its third severe economic shock in as many years due to Brexit, Covid-19 and, most recently, the fallout from the crisis in Ukraine.  We, of course, gave great consideration to the rising cost of living.  As we recognised in our report the cost of living has increased significantly since the commission made its recommendation for the 2022 national minimum wage.  Housing, childcare and transportation continue to be significant issues for minimum wage and low-paid workers.  These issues however cannot be resolved by the minimum wage increases alone.  The national minimum wage is not a panacea.  We have made it clear in our recommendations that the national minimum wage alone will not compensate workers for inflation and recent increases in the cost of living.  Our 80 cent recommendation is significant but we also recommended that supports to low-paid workers should be considered in the context of budget 2023.  The Government indicated that should be a cost-of-living budget and the commission recommended that additional measures are taken to support minimum wage and low-paid workers.<\/p> <p>  The commission also recommended that supports to employers are considered by the Government.  We are all aware of the rising costs affecting individuals and families but the commission also had to consider the rising costs affecting employers.  Employers and their representatives told us that rising costs are affecting all sectors and that they face further labour costs such as pensions auto-enrolment and mandatory sick pay.  We were also conscious of the need to avoid generating inflationary pressures and the need to avoid a wage price spiral when considering wage increases.  We try to balance this by ensuring that low-paid workers receive an increase that helps to ease the pressures they face in meeting day-to-day living costs.<\/p><p>When we talk about next year&rsquo;s increase in the national minimum wage, it is important to highlight the commission&rsquo;s recent recommendations on the progression to a living wage.  Members will be aware that earlier this year we submitted its report on how best the Government could progress to a living wage.  We recommended adopting a fixed-threshold approach for the calculation of a living wage and setting the fixed threshold at 60% of the median wage in the economy.  The commission also recommended that after the 60% target has been reached, subject to an assessment of the impact of this, we should assess the economic practicality of gradually increasing the targeted threshold rate towards 66% of the median wage and make appropriate recommendations.<\/p><p> I thank members and am happy to take any questions they may have on the commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ultan Courtney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Light to make his opening remarks on behalf of Mandate's review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#C00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>With the Chair's permission, my colleague, Mr. Hogan, will provide our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Light"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#C00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson, members, and staff for the invitation to appear before the committee.  Mandate Trade Union represents almost 27,000 workers, primarily in the retail sector.  The union also represents workers within the licensed trade and those in administrative roles.  Many of these workers were operating on the front line during the pandemic.  Our comments reflect their views on the cost of living, the minimum wage, and the report of the Low Pay Commission.<\/p> <p>  We remind the committee that the programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the minimum wage to a living wage by the conclusion of the current D&aacute;il.  We trust that the Government does not mean to renege on this commitment.<\/p> <p>  Our members are being squeezed between low wages and a high cost of living.  The only viable solution to protect these workers is to increase their wages and reduce the cost of the essential public services that these workers rely on.  To ensure our most vulnerable workers have an adequate income, the Government must increase the minimum wage to a living wage, which is just over &euro;14 per hour, as a starting point.  Mandate based this calculation on last year&rsquo;s estimate by the living wage technical group of a living wage hourly rate of &euro;12.90, which is based on a 39-hour working week.  We added 8.5% to reflect the cost of inflation.  The figure of 8.5% is the rate of price inflation projected by Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, this year.  NERI projects further inflation of 4.5% in 2023.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendation of &euro;11.30 per hour, a 7.6% increase, fails to keep pace with 2022 inflation rate and is just 80.7% of a &euro;14 minimum wage.  Matching inflation is the bare minimum expectation of workers.  Anything less would be a pay cut.  How can we have faith in a process that leads to pay cuts and declining living standards for workers?  Wages in Ireland&rsquo;s low-pay sectors of retail and hospitality significantly trail behind wages in the same sectors in other high-income EU countries.  There is no competitiveness issue.<\/p> <p>  Mandate also notes the impact of the commission&rsquo;s last three annual recommendations, which effectively amounts to a cut in real pay.  The rate of nominal increase from 2020 to 2023 is 11.9%, but the rate of economy-wide consumer price inflation between January 2020 and August 2022 was almost 12%, at 11.9%.  Does the commission believe there will be no further price increases between August 2022 and January 2023?  This is not what any institutional forecaster or the European Central Bank, ECB, seems to believe.  Even headline inflation understates the rate of price increases for low-wage workers.  Lower-income households generally spend a higher portion of their incomes on the type of necessities, such as energy, food and rent that are experiencing the sharpest price increases.<\/p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s recommendation means that minimum-wage workers in 2023 will be even further away from earning a living wage.  The recommendation also means that minimum-wage workers will have seen deterioration in their position relative to the median wage over the five years between 2018 and 2023.  By any measure, we can see that minimum-wage workers are falling further behind.<\/p> <p>  The Low Pay Commission is failing in its mandate to protect workers, and we strongly oppose its recommendation because it is too low.  In addition, we are calling for the removal of the discriminatory sub-minimum rates of the minimum wage.  Such discrimination against young workers is a grave injustice that has no place in a modern economy or society.  Equal work should mean equal pay.<\/p> <p>  On the economic impact, the commission will no doubt raise concerns about the impact of a higher minimum wage on the economy, yet the economic literature is clear in that minimum wages and minimum wage increases close to but above inflation do not have any meaningful impact on net employment.  The current national minimum wage in Ireland is barely over half that of the median wage.  This compares to 60% in countries such as France, Portugal and Luxembourg.<\/p> <p>  The economy and the labour market itself are in a strong position.  We are now close to full employment and hours worked in the economy are at record levels.  The unemployment rate is just 4.3% and the job vacancy rate is higher than pre-pandemic levels.  There is an excess of labour demand over labour supply.<\/p> <p>  Low-paid sectors experienced a rapid recovery in 2022.  Net business income exceeds pre-pandemic business income in both the restaurant and retail sectors.  The seasonally adjusted retail sales index in July was 10% higher than its level on the eve of the pandemic.  The hotel sector has also made a robust recovery.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that wages are not driving the current inflationary spike; it is being driven by supply-side factors related to supply chain problems, commodity market shocks and the energy crisis.  In this context, increasing the minimum wage to the living wage would have a minimal impact on price growth.<\/p> <p>  Of course, wage growth is far from keeping pace with inflation.  If the economy gets into a dynamic of falling real incomes, consumer spending will fall and businesses will fail.  That is the reality.  NERI advises that a combination of tightening monetary policy and falling real incomes could push the economy into recession.  On the other hand, a higher wage will result in higher consumer spending.  Low-wage workers have a high propensity to spend and a much higher propensity to spend domestically.  Unlike high-income households, low-paid workers cannot afford to save or, indeed, spend their money on expensive foreign luxuries and holidays.  Their wage increases flow back to businesses across the domestic economy.  Any negative impact of higher wages on business costs will be offset by the benefits arising from the increase in domestic demand.  In addition, higher wages tend to drive a positive dynamic of more motivated and engaged workers and, therefore, improve goodwill and promote effort-based productivity.  Better wages also lead to reduced employee turnover, therefore, lowering recruitment and training costs.  Loss of experience itself means a loss of productivity.  Overall, higher minimum wages increase aggregate demand and facilitate higher productivity dynamics within the firm.<\/p> <p>  Mandate believes the Government should enable workers to improve their own wages directly with their employer.  The best way to do this is to implement enhanced collective bargaining legislation and through union access to legislative rights.  Increasing the hourly rate of pay for workers is irrelevant if their employer cuts their hours or refuses to give them extra hours.  Collective bargaining is the only way to protect workers from unscrupulous employers and ensure they receive an acceptable weekly living wage.  Legislative access for workers who wish to avail of extra hours that become available to improve and secure higher incomes is an absolute need within the sector in addition to securing increases in hourly rates of pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I invite members to discuss issues with representatives.

That acts as a brake on what the commission has to or wants to do.  It is a legitimate way of looking at how increases in this pay in the economy should take place.  On that basis the commission does its best at a point in time with the information that it has from a particular and very large component of the working population, 164,000 people, in very disparate and different kinds of employment, and tries to analyse what will be the best increase going forward.  This is very different from the collective bargaining system that obtains in a very large part of the employment sectors.  In that context, what the Senator has said is probably factually correct but it is not how we try to do business in the sense of trying to keep pace with inflation or the cost of living.  We all know from previous incarnations of ourselves that chasing inflation can lead to all sorts of problems, as such.  It is not precisely what the commission is set up to do.<\/p><p> The commission is set up to try to deal with low pay in a progressive and incremental way over time.  To do anything more quickly can lead to shocks for the system and can lead to potential loss of hours for the workers one is trying to help, and potential loss of jobs where employers start to make substitutions in the hours that they work or in the employment that they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ultan Courtney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Courtney.

It is about the rate being driven to a certain level and the negative impact or the potential consequential impacts.<\/p> <p>  On the Low Pay Commission, my colleague, Patricia King, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and I were very keen to use the considerable budget available to the commission to commission new research because there was a dearth of research, as Mr. Courtney said, and there probably still is.  All research has clearly shown that despite all the sabre-rattling and scaremongering that the impact of a particular rate and above that rate will in some way cost jobs or reduce earnings, that has not proven to be the case up to this point and is not supported by any credible research.  I certainly never heard in all my years a low-paid worker urging caution against getting a pay increase.  Such arguments always came from the employer side on the commission.  It continues to make such arguments.  Looking at the minority report this time around, the difference is stark in that the worker representatives say the increase should be higher, there should be two phases and it should be introduced over the course of this and next year, while the employers are requesting that it be phased in, which is an absolutely nonsensical suggestion in respect of the workers we are talking about.

The minority report also clearly outlines a much more realistic and fairer approach for low-paid workers.  After all, one in five workers in this country is on low pay.  It is one of the highest rates, if not the highest, in Europe.  I am not coming back to the question about the budget, Chair, do not worry, but 1 million of those workers, nearly a third of them, earn wages that are so low they are not even in the tax net.

That is &euro;10 billion taken out of the economy and we have no control over it.  Given the Government is trying to shelter people and businesses from the impact of that, is it not valid to say that, if the Government can avoid a wage-price spiral in Ireland, it should be doing so, and part of the motivation of the Government is to prevent excessive wages at a difficult time?  Is that not a reasonable position?  I believe that has motivated the Government in the things it is doing on rent, working family payments, electricity, GP cards and so on.

It also commissions research from Maynooth University and the ESRI makes a lot of valuable contributions.  Many contributions come from submissions that people make, such as small employers and the unions, including Mandate.  All of that goes into the mix to try to make a recommendation.<\/p> <p>  We are constrained by what we are asked to do.  We literally cannot make it up.  We cannot just decide on an increase because we think that is the right increase.  We have to take account of all of these things.  There are two main issues.  The main thing is obviously to do what we are tasked to do.  I was interested to hear the Deputy&rsquo;s comment about a fair and sustainable increase in low pay.  That is what we are here to do as well over time, but we are tasked also to ensure that we do not impact on employment and competitiveness, which would be a negative impact for the workers we are trying to help at the end of the day.  There are lots of good reasons for raising the minimum wage and there are negatives to doing it as well but, overall, we want to try to improve the position for people without having the net effect of a deterioration in jobs in the economy or of making the economy worse off.<\/p> <p>  The critical difficulty, as noted in the discussion with Senator Gavan, is the inflationary impact which is now impacting on what we do.  We have not had that for the last ten years or so.  That has been a period of price stability from which we have all benefited.  Trying to get inflation back down is a critical matter which helps us inordinately in our work as well.  The last thing we want to do, and it is the same problem the trade union movement faces, is to do wage deals that do not have a real increase in income.  Everybody states that the public sector pay deals that were done in Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail, organisations that I had dealings with, will all have to face that.  They do not seek to try to put them beyond inflationary pressure because we all know, particularly those who went through all of this in the 1970s and 1980s, what a wage spiral does.  It takes away the good of what we are trying to do, which is to improve the lot of those who have the least.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ultan Courtney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>My colleague wants to come in as well on the back of this response.

I have already quoted the attitude of one employer I heard this morning that in some way what happened in the budget yesterday is substituting responsibility or taking away that responsibility from an employer to pay a decent wage.  That is always the primary responsibility.<\/p> <p>  Based on my years of experience on the commission and also based on the research that has been carried out on the issue, I do not accept the point made by Mr. Courtney.  He talks about the activity largely within the unionised sector.  We have to realise that the workers we are talking about are predominantly non-union.  They are the lowest paid workers in our society and I do not believe that a decent pay increase for them has the potential to spike inflation in any major way.  Again, previous research has shown in respect of competitiveness and productivity that one of the important points is that many of the jobs we are talking about are not internationally comparable and they are very much in the domestic economy.

Many Mandate members who work part-time have telephoned the organisation to tell us that they have deferred their college places because they cannot find accommodation and cannot afford accommodation if they find it, yet the Low Pay Commission has recommended that some of these people who are under the age of 20 should get a lower rate because of their age.

The Low Pay Commission and its predecessors came into existence to do something about that and give safeguards.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gerry Light was quite correct to say that there is no collective bargaining for that very indistinct group of people that was made up of very different components.  For example, the group is comprised of a large percentage of young people.  There is also a regional mix.  That means the minimum wage is more important the further south, west and north one travels but less important in the midlands and eastern regions.  The minimum wage is also important in particular sectors such as accommodation, wholesale and retail areas.  It is important that recognition is given to the fact that the group is made up of different groups.<\/p> <p>  The problem for us in the Low Pay Commission and for organisations who wish to make submissions is to address all of those different groups or combinations or segments of particular sectors with one recommendation that fits all.  As members can see, that does not always work because people have different inputs into that.  Some people say we should not do this or that which makes it extremely difficult to create a joint recommendation.  It would be much easier if we had collective bargaining with a company or firm and dealt with a particular union where both parties had much more perfect knowledge of the circumstances of the business so in that sense it is important.<\/p> <p>  Form the perspective of the Low Pay Commission, commissioners are all fully conscious of how important the minimum wage is to anyone who gets it.  We do believe that it is important as an entry point in terms of people progressing.  Evidence shows that people, and sometimes up to 30% of those people in a nine-month period, progressed to the next stage of their pay within the business so the minimum wage can facilitate that.  The minimum wage can also facilitate people who wish to pursue further education and do not want to work as many hours as they did.  It can act as a very important mechanism for ensuring that people progress within the economy and I think that is important.  I am sure that most of us will remember that before one could get secondary education people did not have the education or ability to seek higher paid jobs, which is one of the transformations that has happened in Ireland over the past 70 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ultan Courtney"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I am glad to hear that Mr. Courtney express his support for collective bargaining.

Within that, we have many different sectors.  The broad-brush approach to pay that I hear unions talk about does not apply.  A company that was topical a couple of years ago was Debenhams, where a significant number of people were employed by a multinational on low-paid contract hours.  I do not think anybody could think that what happened there was just treatment of workers.<\/p> <p>  However, that policy cannot be applied to  small businesses, especially rural and regional employers.  I will give a simple metric.  If one employs four low-paid workers, in which one can include oneself as a promoter, one's annual wage bill, including employer cost, will be close to &euro;100,000.  If one is working off a 20% revenue model, which many businesses are, that means one needs to turn over &euro;500,000 to cover those costs.  I challenge many people at the meeting to develop a business, employ four people and see how successful they will be in developing &euro;500,000 in annual sales.  <\/p> <p>  Many businesses are struggling.  They are having a difficult time in the current business environment and wages are just one of the significant cost burdens that they bear.  I can tell Mr. Courtney, as someone who has run businesses, that many will not bother to go to the Labour Court to cite inability to pay.  They will reduce their working time and the number of operators they have and they will change their systems of how they do their business to try to reduce the employment component within that.  That is a significant problem in the economy.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Courtney has made reference to, having a low skill set is a problem in getting a decent wage because, ultimately, it feeds into how much people are worth.  Having said that, the economy has been doing quite well up until now and most workers are getting a reasonable wage.  The budget yesterday was certainly favourable to the lower paid and the public service has to support low-paid working in terms of healthcare, medical card access, employment subsidies and family income supplement because small businesses cannot carry that.  I am inundated at present with small business owners who are in serious trouble because of inflation in the economy.  I hear people here talking about employers being very hard on employees in what they pay.  Some members on this committee are not living in the real world.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Courtney said the terms of reference of the Low Pay Commission are fairly narrow.

He is quite correct that there is a smaller profile of companies that are entrepreneurs who have taken considerable risk and find the challenge of business at present extremely strong.

It seems counterintuitive because, on the one hand, we all know that the money put into the pockets of low-paid workers does not sit in investment funds or languish in bank accounts, but goes straight back into the economy while, on the other, we are told welfare is good for business and will not increase inflation.

The hope is that something such as that is short, sharp and then ends.  The concern is that will go on and we will continue to have an inflationary increase.  That can continue to be exacerbated by prices and sometimes by people sometimes taking profits that are too high.  Minister have referred to that but I do not have evidence of it.

I remember when the national minimum wage came in first.  It was under the Minister at the time, Mary Harney, if I remember correctly.  It was a seismic change.  It is now embedded, thankfully, and we talk about it as being normal.  As Deputy Bruton said, we want it to be sustainable.  We want people to get the most they can out of it.<\/p> <p>  I notice in Mr. Courtney's recommendation that he says it is not a panacea and that the minimum wage will not now compensate workers for inflation and recent increases.  He goes on to say that the supports to low-paid workers should be considered in the context of budget 2023, which, as Deputy Bruton pointed out, has happened.  Mr. Courtney also states the budget should be a cost-of-living budget and the commission recommends that additional measures be taken to support the minimum wage and low-paid workers.  Am I right in saying that, when Mr. Courtney is making his recommendation, he is factoring in supports from the State to low-paid workers as well?  Mr. Light seems to feel that should not be the case, that it should be an add-on.  Correct me if I am wrong.  There seems to be a situation where the State is supporting low-paid workers to quite a large extent.<\/p> <p>  One figure I noticed is that the number of people receiving the working family payment has dropped quite a bit from 2016 to this year, by almost 9,000.  I do not know why that is.  Perhaps Mr. Light can explain why that might be the case, given we are at almost full employment.  We have 4.5% unemployment, which is essentially full employment.  That is one question and observation rolled into one.<\/p> <p>  We should have employers and business in before the committee as well as soon as possible to discuss this.  We have all received a lot of fairly startling information from small and family businesses regarding the pressures they are under now, such as the cost of energy increases, the cost of rates going up, the cost of turnover going up in some instances, which is related to rates, and so forth.  Many of them are under an awful lot of pressure.  I would contend, and I am sure Mr. Light and others would agree with me, that it is better that people be at work and getting the minimum wage, as articulated, and the State supports than to be out of work.  I am concerned that we could have a lot of small and family businesses going to the wall in the next few months because they just cannot be sustained.  They are telling us that some of the things they might have to do is to reduce hours, reduce labour costs or let people go.  We do not want this to happen either.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Courtney and his team have a tough job in trying balance the competitiveness of the economy with trying to keep people in jobs and to keep businesses sustainable.  We live in unprecedented times.  People are talking about nuclear war.  This is just phenomenal.  As Deputy Carthy, I think, said, we have to start thinking about where we are at.  This is unprecedented.  I am old enough to remember the 1970s and the fuel crisis at that stage.  That was scary but it was short and sharp.  This is a crazy time we are living in at the moment.  I hope we will get to the end of it, but who knows.  I will leave it at that.

I believe I have already made that submission to the committee about the pressures everybody is under regarding this issue, no matter if they are a worker, an employer, the State or anybody else.  The only good news is we have a surplus in the budget and we are able to do something to try to alleviate that pressure.  That should, I hope, be a one-off.  If it is not, we have a different problem.  We have faced this before.  We have to figure out how we are going to deal with that, which will require a different response.  At the end of the day, the role of the Low Pay Commission is to contribute to trying to find a solution to some of these issues.<\/p> <p>  There was a very telling comment made, I think by Deputy Stanton, about different times and the sense there is a progression in the thinking on these matters.  Certainly, when I was younger, any talk of a minimum wage was seen as completely anathema.  It was seen as something that would have devastating consequences for employment.  That has not proven to be the case.  I believe part of the reason for that has been that the economy has grown.  Many of the actual factors we need for growth in the economy are there.<\/p> <p>  The challenge, and it is a challenge, and I thank the Deputy for recognising that, and while I do not have the answer, I do have a path going forward with the co-operation of the commission, the Government, the Oireachtas, obviously, and everyone else, is to try to get to a situation where a living wage, if it is to be implemented, is implemented in a sensible fashion from which people will benefit.  I am a strong believer, and I know all of the members of the commission are, that it is important to keep businesses competitive to provide additional income for people and give them an opportunity to progress and grow into the future.  That is very important going forward.  Rather than being a low-wage economy, we need to be a higher-wage economy, giving the benefits of that particular growth to, or trying to share the benefits of it with, everybody as we do that.  We are constrained by this fear that at the end of the day we do more harm than good.

Much of our thinking was framed by that, but the report is also cautious about the 60% and 66% targets.  It states that because people are not at that level, there is no information and the academic research is not available to support that approach.  Until we get that information, we must be cautious about it.  I do not make an apology for that because at the end of the day, I will not suffer.  Either a small business will close, and they do close, or a worker will have his or her hours reduced or lose his or her job.

The important point is that it exists.  We must recognise that very high numbers of workers are on low pay and the State must intervene.  I do not subscribe to the concept that any job is better than no job.  I know the Deputy is not advocating it, and he has a particular view, but if we get into that space, we very quickly have to start to deal with potential exploitation and indeed compulsion in respect of people being forced to take up work.  Work should always be attractive enough to invite people to participate in the labour market.  My colleagues and I presented the statistics earlier.  We still have a high level of low pay in this country.  As a practising trade union official and a low pay commissioner for six years, I have always had huge sympathy for the challenges faced by businesses and small businesses in particular.  We try to take that on board.  Measures are available to protect them.  Notwithstanding what one of the previous contributors said about a reluctance to go to the Labour Court to state they are unable to pay, that provision is available.  It is a considerable safety net but one that is rarely used.  I would also point out to the commission that, contrary to the view expressed by the Deputy, research does not support the position that employers who find themselves in challenging situations either reduce the number of staff or staff hours.  Since the introduction of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, employers are required to afford workers hours they have established over a reference period.  That is the best answer I can give to the points raised by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022092800002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Light"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Obviously we are in dramatically changed circumstances since 2018 and none of us knows where it will go or end up.

Deputy O'Reilly spoke about the value of having that access and the statutory right to collectively bargain.

I thank the Chair and the distinguished members of the committee.  My colleague, Mr. O&rsquo;Shea, and myself are delighted to have this opportunity to engage and address the committee here today on behalf of EMI.  It is lovely to be back in person, given that the most recent couple of presentations were done virtually.<\/p> <p>  It is a privilege to be here and, as the Chair, outlined we will discuss EMI&rsquo;s annual Ireland and EU poll and the Conference on the Future of Europe.  Both these topics and the insights presented by them have particular significance this year, because not only have we marked the 50th anniversary on 10 May 2022 of the vote by the Irish people to join the then EEC, we will mark our formal accession on 1 January 2023.  Next year also marks the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  While I will not go into that too much in my opening remarks, we will be happy to discuss it further during our exchanges later.<\/p> <p>  As members well know, since 2013, when Ireland held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, we in EMI have carried out annual, independent polling on how people throughout the country view Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union.  This year, as a special marking of Ireland EU 50, we carried out our research in two parts.  We presented the first set of findings on 9 May, coinciding with Europe Day and with 50 years since the referendum.  We presented and published our second set of findings on 21 September, which was last week.<\/p> <p>  Going back to May, and to the stalwart question that we pose each year, we found that support for Ireland remaining a member of the EU increased by 4% since last year&rsquo;s finding to 88%.  The May 2022 poll also found that 76% of respondents agreed that they have a good understanding of how the EU works.<\/p><p>However, our September poll found that 56% of people in Ireland believe that the EU is moving in the right direction.  While a slight increase of 3% from past year, it does nonetheless show a gap between the 88% who support Ireland's EU membership and those who believe the EU is going in the right direction.  It is perhaps a useful cautionary reminder.<br\/><br\/>We found that young people, those in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic, and the older cohort of people aged between 55 and 65 plus, had the strongest level of belief that the EU is moving in the right direction, up to 69% in some instances.  While those in the middle cohort of the 35- to 54-year-olds being the most pessimistic.  Interestingly, that mirrors a similar trend that we found across a number of questions.<br\/><br\/>Turning topically and understandably to the issues of climate change and the energy crisis, 58% agree that member states should be allowed to delay meeting EU environmental targets to deal with the current energy crisis.An overwhelming majority of people &ndash; some 86% &ndash; are concerned that the cost-of-living crisis is harming the EU economy.  When we asked if the euro has been positive for Ireland, support remained high at 72% but, interestingly, represents a 14% decline on 2019 when we last posed this question when 86% of people then believed that the euro was positive for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As the Russian invasion of Ukraine now enters its seventh month, 65% of people are in favour of Ukraine joining the EU, while 62% of people, when we turn to the topic of enlargement, agree that the EU should continue to allow more countries to join.  The poll also shows that half of people believe the security situation in Europe means that Ireland should increase its defence spending.  In our poll when we asked if Ireland should be part of increased EU defence and security co-operation, 59% agreed, which was up 5% from the previous year.<br\/><br\/>Turning to Northern Ireland, some 57% supported the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland while 35% did not know and 8% disagreed.  This is the highest level of do not knows and may indicate that there is a knowledge deficit in this area.  Interestingly as well, we saw the greatest levels of divergences across the different age ranges in replies to this question.  Up to 50% of those in the younger 18 to 34 year-old demographic stating that they did not know if they supported the protocol.  However, we saw increased support and fewer do not knows for the protocol in older age ranges, in particular those over 55 where support levels reached 75%.  Meanwhile almost one third of people, some 31%,, believe there will be a united Ireland in the EU in the next ten years, while 43% disagree and 26% do not know.  Of any question that we have asked in our polling data, the responses we have received on this issue have remained constant for three years, which is noteworthy in itself going, up or down one or two percentage points within the margin of error every year.<br\/><br\/>The Conference on the Future of Europe polling, and our annual Ireland in the EU poll, provide but a snapshot of sentiment at a point in time but our community engagement work builds on this to understand the views and ideas of people across the country.  This approach was most recently applied to our work on the Conference on the Future of Europe, which concluded the first phase of its work during the summer.  Many members of the committee will be familiar with the work of the Conference.  I want to mention those Oireachtas Members who were also members of the conference plenary, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Senator Higgins, Deputy Richmond, Deputy Niamh Smyth and, separately, Ms Deirdre Clune, Ireland South MEP.  I also thank the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for his strong and consistent support and engagement with the Conference on the Future of Europe process.  Many others also engaged with it in the House or through some of the many regional events, and indeed local county councillors as well.  This engagement and support of public representatives was vital to contributing to the success of the conference process in Ireland.  We in EMI work closely in collaboration with the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs to co-ordinate and organise broad, open, and inclusive events where people shared their ideas and inputted their views around the many key themes of the conference.  Due to the pandemic, these events took place virtually and we were delighted when health guidelines permitted these events to take place in person.  More than 70 events organised by many different organisations throughout Ireland, which included more than 4,500 people representing people from island communities, minority groups, young people, community activists, our diaspora, the newly arrived Irish people across the island and also our community overseas.  For us in European Movement Ireland we made a particular effort to speak to and engage with people outside of the so-called bubble and it was fantastic to see their input and their buy-in.  As part of the conference, the multilingual digital platform was launched which received almost 19,000 ideas from more than 53,000 participants across the EU.  The strong level of Irish engagement from citizens was with the with the topic of European democracy.  Other areas with high levels of engagement included a stronger economy, social justice and jobs, digital transformation, climate change and the environment, education, culture, youth, sport and health.<br\/><br\/>Interestingly, in our discussions in Ireland, two key themes emerged and were the most dominant.  Simply, people wanted better communication about the EU, issues and policies.  They want information that is delivered in a simple accessible and digestible way.  That came across regardless of which of the panels or the engagements that took place, regionally, geographically or demographically.  Second, what we thought was encouraging as well, was that people in Ireland felt that there is untapped potential to share best practice across member states and the EU institutions in policy areas.  People want more opportunity to learn how to do things better from our EU neighbours and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  People want information to understand how the EU relates to their lives and how it can make people's lives better.  <br\/><br\/>Complementing the work of EMI on the conference, I was also honoured to serve as Ireland&rsquo;s national citizens&rsquo; representative to the conference plenary.  Following an open and independent competition, I, as the national citizens&rsquo; representative, and Ms Emmy Coffey Nguyen as the alternate national citizens&rsquo; representative had the honour to represent Ireland and present our national recommendations over many days in the European Parliament in Strasbourg last winter and up to the end of May this year.  I was appointed to the digital transformation working group and there was a huge level of engagement and input that we were able to feed back into the process throughout Ireland as part of this work.  <br\/><br\/>As members will be aware, the plenary culminated in a report centred on 49 proposals that include more than 320 measures for the EU institutions to follow up on under nine topics.  We now need to ensure that these recommendations are followed by tangible, implementable proposals that will deliver on the issues raised.  They cannot be allowed to gather dust in some report on a shelf.  We want to see action and implementation.  Interestingly, the European Parliament responded to the conference by calling for a convention for the revision of the treaties on 9 June, proposing among other things, a reform of voting procedures, more competences in the area of health, the right of initiative for the European Parliament and strengthening rule of law procedures.  Earlier this month, the European Commission rowed in behind the call for a convention, with President von der Leyen expressing support during her state of the Union speech.<br\/><br\/>While many of the proposals do not require treaty change, some may do so and it is certainly evident from these calls for a convention that reform of the treaties is back as a talking point after being somewhat of a taboo subject for some years.  Understandably, there is reluctance in terms of potential treaty change.  However, a democratic process such as the Conference on the Future of Europe is a very much a two-sided bargain.  If people are asked to engage then we cannot ignore the results of that engagement.  We believe a lack of follow through on recommendations from the conference will only erode public trust in the EU and any future public engagement.<\/p><p>The conference process was a bold democratic experiment; in fact, it was the world's largest experiment in participatory democracy.  Of course, it was not perfect.  Perfection is hard and difficult to achieve over one year, but the system of democracy is one we must cherish and hold dear.  It is based on evolution - one rooted in change.  It rests on the principle of continually striving to be better, more inclusive and more representative.  This was something that the citizens and all participants in the conference strongly called for.  It is part of that process.  Those of us invested must advocate that this wish becomes part of the political infrastructure of the EU.<\/p><p> We know from the conference, our engagement and my own participation as the national citizen representative that people in this country want to be engaged in what the EU is doing, have their voices heard and contribute their opinions.  From our perspective in the EMI, we are very clear that we want this process and dialogue to continue, up to and including treaty change, if that proves necessary.  It does not have to be the starting-off point, but nor should it be excluded.  We welcome the sentiments in this regard expressed by the Taoiseach and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  If we waste the opportunity presented by the conference, there will be consequences.  Equally, if we grasp the opportunity afforded by it, we will be a little further along on the journey towards a more inclusive, more democratic and better-functioning Europe, which is something we can all aspire to.

Ms O'Connell said she has been busy recently, but she may be busier if she is advocating for treaty change.  We know how that goes in this country.  It is a big job of work.  Ms O'Connell is correct; we should not be afraid of it, if it is needed.  Things move on and the Union has evolved since the most recent treaty change.  We should not be afraid to update the treaties.<\/p> <p>   Ms O'Connell said, I think, 56% of respondents believe that the EU is moving in the right direction, which means 44% do not or do not know.

With that health warning, in terms of treaty change, what we feel very strong is, as the process evolves and people buy into it, it is really important that the process is not allowed to wither on the vine and is not just filed away.  There is that desire to keep the momentum and that dialogue and engagement going.  We should not be afraid of treaty change if that is what is required, but we do not believe it should be the starting-off point.  There is a lot that can be done under the existing treaties and clauses.  There are opportunities via the passerelle\u00a0clause.  We are calling for a stronger and more robust Union that is more agile and able to be more proactive in reacting to the views and inputs of its citizens.  It is something we feel strongly about.  It is also something that came across throughout the dialogues we engaged with as part of this process.  I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; will agree, through being involved in the conference plenaries, it is something that came across from all of the European citizens and the stakeholders, Members of the European Parliament and national parliamentarians.  There is broad buy-in and ambition.  If we have seen anything, it has been the value of that collective or shared EU.  With the departure of a member state on the west and an invasion on the east, we cannot afford to take lightly or for granted our membership of the Union.<\/p> <p>  That was a great question about the polling methodology.  We commissioned RED C to carry out the poll and the questions are delivered as statements.  To aid people's ability to respond and engage with the question, they are put as statements, for example, \"Ireland should remain a member of the EU\".  They are then asked, \"Do you agree strongly, slightly, disagree strongly, disagree slightly or do not know?\"  We see a big role for ourselves in working with the \"do not know\" cohort.  In many of the questions, we saw quite high levels of \"do not knows\", indicating perhaps an understanding deficit or information deficit.  In our role of communicating on all aspects of Ireland's relationship with the EU, that communications work is something that we want to continue to ramp up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#D01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>It is quite interesting that we have now got a majority in favour of greater co-operation on defence, which is something we were afraid to talk about a number of years ago, but circumstances have changed.

We saw quite an adverse reaction to Ireland joining the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, which involves co-operating on training exercises and sharing of knowledge, not troops on the ground anywhere.

We cannot deny the impact the Russian invasion of Ukraine had on this.  In the May poll, the fieldwork took place in and around the same time as the HSE cyberattack.

For example, we published an explainer policy document on the publication of the strategic compass by the institutions last spring.

As we mentioned in our opening remarks, 74 events took place with more than 4,500 people taking part, whether in our events, virtually or in events organised by the Department of Foreign Affairs events.  Civil society and business groups also organised events and Members of this House organised events and debates as part of the conference process.  The level of Irish engagement per head of population was quite high and this is something we can be very proud of.  It reflects well on our strong tradition of participatory democratic engagement and the citizens' assembly model was frequently held up among our European colleagues as a best-in-class or best-practice model.  A number of randomly selected Irish citizens were chosen to take part and represent Ireland as part of the European citizens' panels.  They were active and engaged.  It was great to have a European citizens' panel event take place in Dublin Castle.  The date had to be rearranged due to the C-word - the Covid pandemic - but it was fantastic and, as the saying goes, we punched above our weight in our active engagement.  If I may pay tribute, Members of the Oireachtas, including Deputy &Oacute; M&uacute;rch&uacute;, attended in Strasbourg and we made interventions at the plenary.  That active engagement and input are important, particularly on the working group side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I will start with the Conference on the Future of Europe, the idea of the convention and everything that was done imperfectly from the point of view of the conference, especially at the beginning.  The idea that greater and more consistent interaction with citizens is needed and that Europe is well removed from a considerable number of people was a big thing.  Anyone who goes out into the street here would know that.  We must follow up on the work that has been done and maintain a forum in which we can do it.  Everyone bought into that idea.  As important as all the interventions were, I was never quite clear why certain interventions made at plenary session or working group level were recorded on the books.  We could probably say that about a lot of the work the European Movement Ireland did too.<\/p> <p>  As I stated in Europe, interactions and civic engagements on Ireland took place.  I am referring specifically to Ireland's Future and we know it will hold a big event in the 3 Arena on Saturday.  None of that plugged in, however, and even if it had, it would not have mattered.  Only certain State interactions ended up in the overall report and it must have been on the basis of how the selections were made.  That was a flaw at the organisers' end.  I do not blame the European Movement Ireland, the committee or anyone else.<\/p> <p>  I understand that this all happened during the period of Covid initially.  This was followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we were also coming out of the Brexit situation, if we are ever to come out of it, and dealing with the relationship with Britain.  The solidarity shown across Europe then and the vital pieces of work done at a European level, in particular the block-buying of vaccines, shows the European Union has an ability to operate even in areas where it does not have a competence.  That could be missed to some degree when people are looking at reshaping the European Union.  Major work needs to be done and follow-through is definitely needed.  I am a bit disappointed with how some of the process went and that definitely needs to be dealt with at a later stage of interaction.<\/p> <p>  As regards the question of defence, it is probably not that surprising that people see defence in a slightly different form now.   We see it from a point of view of the Russian invasion and asymmetrical warfare and hybrid operations, to use those great terms.  We also see the absolute necessity of cyber.  People realise what neutrality means and to some degree defence spending needs to be increased to enable neutrality and a non-aligned position and to do our fair share in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As Senator Chambers said, we probably need to do a lot of diving down into many of these questions.  Some of the answers to the issues related to the Irish protocol are frightening.  I assume, perhaps wrongly, that there is a misunderstanding as regards some of the answers that have come back.<\/p> <p>  Everybody deals with the issue in front of them, be it health or whatever else, in a silo and sometimes it gets simplified, as if we had five people in a room and we need to get a majority decision.  People begin to think this does not make sense.  At European level, everyone is thinking about Hungary and people are arguing that we need to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting, while missing the big wins for the European Union in recent times such as the fact that we could do deals.  It was difficult for people to come up with agreements but they did and the European Union as a collection of democracies was able to operate on a level that controlled states or economies were not able to do.  The arguments relating to the European Union and democracy within it have held up in recent times.<\/p> <p>  My main questions relate to drilling down on the questions that were asked, the issues surrounding the Conference on the Future of Europe and any proposals the witnesses have on how that could be improved as regards engagement.  There was a failure on some level to provide the citizens with some of the information from the institutions in relation to what is being done and what can be done.  Sometimes they are looking for answers that are not needed in the sense that, as a collective, we have shown an ability to come up with agreements.  Treaty change or whatever will not necessarily be needed, although I do not rule it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#E00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":541,"content":"<p>To pick up on some of the Deputy's points, I completely agree with him and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Even as I meandered<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#E00600","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Not at all.

No, but we were able to input and shape it and as in all things European Union-related it reflects a compromise with something that is as multifaceted and as challenging as trying to piece it all together notwithstanding the structural challenges of the conference in terms of the sometimes opposing interests between and within the EU institutions; and the various challenges of being overshadowed by external events.  What came across very strongly, and something that we are calling for, is the recommendations prepared by the citizens' panels and by the outcome of the conference.  It really demonstrates, and especially to elected representatives and to all of us, the expectations that citizens across Europe have and that they place on the European Union.  The fact is that people believe, - and this is borne out by our polls - that the EU should assume more responsibility, perhaps exhibit greater external unity and use its strengths, regulatory powers and economic policies to advance those great transformation projects such as the Green Deal or the digital agenda, which is something that I saw very strongly in the digital transformation working group.  <\/p><p> In terms of implementing the conference proposals, exclusively predicating them on the questions of treaty change is not really what a lot of the citizens were talking about.   They just want the EU to work better for everyone collectively.  It then becomes more transparent and it picks up on Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point as well on how it communicates better outside of that conference process; we really believe that this ongoing task should continue.  It should be a model of representative citizens' panels.  It is certainly one that can be taken away.  The good work and the example that we in Ireland have done on that is certainly credible.  It creates a genuine European input and a momentum.  If there is some way that the EU and the institutions could institutionalise and harness this engagement, it would be really welcome.   <\/p><p> I might ask Mr. O'Shea to come in on the methodology and to do the drilling down for some of the questions in the poll.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is absolutely right.  I know that we have a follow-on event on 2 December that we will attend in Brussels.  If we could keep that momentum going and keep that conversation alive, that is really important.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  Obviously there is always more we would like to learn from the polling.  To a certain degree, like any opinion polling, we are restricted in a certain sense.  For us it is really valuable because each year we look at priorities that are topical.  It is a really valuable test of sentiment for us in terms of guiding our own work, and guiding our citizen engagement that arises from it.  We do try to drill down in that way.  For example, on energy and the cost of living we are running four events around the country on energy with the European Commission over the winter.  The sentiment and the findings in the polling will guide our engagement through those events.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, to give another example on the euro question, what we can try to do as well is to match it up with other research.  Since we last asked that question support for the euro has fallen by about 14%.  If one matches that there is some research from Lund University that postulates that support for the common currency is linked to employment and inflation.  That insight will guide our work on those issues over the period ahead.  It is very difficult to drill down into why certain figures in Connacht-Ulster might be lower or why we see across a lot of questions the middle age brackets being less supportive than other age groups.  Anecdotally we know that is pretty consistent with a lot of opinion polling.  If we look back at some of the research that has been done on the Brexit referendum, yes there was an element of a left behind marginalised group, but there was also an issue in that squeezed middle or whatever one wants to call that group.  Scepticism was a factor in Brexit and I think that you see it in political polling as well.  It is not a perfect science, as politicians know well, but it is very useful in terms of guiding our own work, evaluating that the issues that we are focusing on are those which are relevant to public sentiment at a point in time.  I hope that is helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>It is.

One thing that struck me is in relation to the Ireland and the Northern Ireland protocol.  That 34% do not know whether they support it.  That is a surprise given the amount of publicity the protocol is getting.  There obviously is a job of work to do for the Government, the Oireachtas and dare I say it, by European Movement Ireland as well to try to explain the importance of that.<\/p> <p>  Generally speaking, support for the EU is strong in Ireland, give or take slight variations here and there on some of the questions and that is a good thing.  Could witnesses clarify a point on the age cohorts?  I know they made some reference to the older demographic and the younger demographic.  Perhaps I picked it up wrong or is there a sense that younger people are less supportive of the EU, or aspects of the EU, because that would be a surprise to me on the basis of the Brexit referendum whereby the young people by and large supported remaining and it was the older people who wanted to leave?  I would be interested to know whether there is a sharp divergence between young people and old people's attitudes to the EU.  <\/p> <p>  On the conference, I would like to thank European Movement Ireland for the work that it did, and Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others.  They did the State some service I would say by their participation in that and we do all appreciate it.  It is great to see Ireland strongly represented.<\/p> <p>  I want to zone in on two issues.  I worry a little about the proposal for a European political community put forward by President Macron and supported by the European Commission President.  Is that seen as a substitute for full membership of the European Union or how do the witnesses see that working in practice?  Is the proposal by President Macron something they would support?  One would wonder if this is getting into a two-tier Europe in terms of membership and I would be interested in witnesses' views on that.  <\/p> <p>  The second question relates to treaty change and the proposal for a convention on treaty change, supported by the European Parliament and the European Commission.  A number of issues arise there: switching from unanimity to qualified majority voting; strengthening EU competence in health and energy; incorporating the pillar of social rights into the treaty and providing the European Parliament with a right to legislative initiative.<\/p><p>They are some of the issues that could be embraced by treaty change.  Like Senator Chambers, I worry about it in an Irish context although I am probably not too afraid of it, I suppose.<\/p><p> Which issues does EMI think are important in respect of treaty change?  What are the most important things we could do?  I feel that treaty change should be limited and very clear-cut.  It should not be wide-ranging because we are talking about a referendum.<\/p><p> Finally, the opening statement mentioned plans for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of our joining the EU next year.  Are plans being formulated at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#F00700","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I advise the committee to watch this space for our plans to mark the anniversary on 1 January 2023.  We have lots in store.  As I know Deputy Haughey is aware, it is very much a 24-month process, if we can do it that way.  We see it as part of the ongoing work we are doing.  We would appreciate the ongoing support and engagement of the members for the Ireland EU50 competition for primary, post-primary and third levels.  It is an initiative of the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and is supported by the Department of Education.  It involves encouraging all young people across the country to enter a competition on what Ireland EU50 means to them.  That is a big part of the work that we will be doing.  We will be commemorating it digitally as well.  We are doing a digital anthology on Ireland's EU relationship.  We are also publishing a series of papers called 50 steps to 50 years of membership.  We see it as a way of getting people to engage, looking forward to the type of EU that people in Ireland want to be part of, and examining how we shape and influence that for the next 50 years.  It is a really ambitious range of projects and programmes across our different streams.<\/p> <p>  Also on engagement, we were delighted to have the Taoiseach do an \"in conversation\" podcast moderated by Professor Brigid Laffan in which he shared his reflections.  We hope to continue the EU 50 podcast in the coming months and in the year ahead.  We will keep the committee members engaged as ever.  I thank the Deputy for his support on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a really good point on the European political community, EPC.  EMI supports anything that can encourage debate and engagement on the EU and all matters European but we believe the EPC must be complementary and must not be a substitute for enlargement and for that process.  As we have seen in our Ireland and the EU poll, 62% of people are very much aligned with the Government's priorities of supporting enlargement and accession countries.  There is a high level of support for enlargement.  We do not want to see the EPC being a substitute.  We are living in an increasingly geopolitically challenged and more diverse continent.  With Brexit, which none of us wanted or welcomed, how we navigate and engage with countries that are not part of the EU, the multilateral world order and the rule of law system is something that the EU saw as part of the conference process.  People want the EU to be more robust and to be a beacon for the values on which it was founded.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely understand the point about treaty change and referendums and hear where the Deputy is coming from.  What we hear across our counterparts and networks is that the possibility of this happening imminently has probably waned and is somewhat on the back burner.  There is certainly reluctance among member states, notwithstanding the views of the Parliament and the Commission.  This can only happen with political will.  We must see where it aligns.  We are not calling for treaty change for the sake of it.  We have always been very clear that we want a better, more reflective and more efficiently functioning EU that responds in an agile and proactive manner to the needs, wants and wishes of all its citizens, notwithstanding the challenges.  The geostrategic transformation of Europe which is going on at the moment is something we need to keep an eye on.<\/p> <p>  On some of the changes and how we look at things like qualified majority voting in the foreign policy arena, we think there is a way to look at this via the Passerelle clause and others, as I mentioned.  We saw with the fiscal compact treaty how workaround solutions can come about.  That is something where there is precedent.  The next generation of EU funding is also an example of the EU nimbly working to come up with solutions at short notice.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea might like to come in on the younger demographic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I can clarify that for the Deputy.  By and large, the younger demographic and the older demographic are the most supportive.  We tend to see a sort of U curve across many questions.  It is among those in the 35 to 54 age range that support falls off.  On the EU energy targets question, we found that young people were most likely to disagree with the notion that energy targets should be cast aside because of the current pressures we face.  Young people tend to be quite enthusiastic and quite idealistic in their responses.  I have some more interesting nuggets.  We find \"don't knows\" higher among females than males quite a lot.  At the beginning of the meeting, the Chair mentioned that levels of support are less than the national average in Connacht-Ulster in particular.<\/p> <p>  On the EPC, personally I thought the state of the Union address was interesting in respect of the President's commitment to grant Ukraine access to certain aspects of the Single Market and to provide mobile roaming rights to Ukraine.  It is interesting in terms of the debate about the EPC.  It could be an interesting structure around which to build co-operation whereby you grant aspiring member states some of the privileges and rights of membership before membership actually takes place.  That is a way to keep them engaged and to reward progress or whatever you want to call it.  Perhaps there is potential for a structure which would provide some of the benefits of membership while being on the road to membership because as we know the accession process is long and tortuous.  We see that in the western Balkans where people tend to find it difficult to keep communities and populations engaged.  That is just a personal view on that aspect of the matter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I thank both Ms O'Connell and Mr. O'Shea for the very good presentation and for the ongoing work of EMI.<\/p> <p>  If it is okay, I want to go back and ask about polling.

However, is that a surprise, considering that the vast majority of people who negotiated the protocol in the UK do not seem to understand it either, based on how it is being implemented and their approach?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the direction of the EU.  To be honest, this question is probably a bit more serious.  While I welcome the finding on the percentage of people who are happy with the direction, is this the space that the Conference on the Future of Europe - at which the witnesses represented the citizens of Ireland so well - needs to fill?  I do not believe many of the 50-odd recommendations from the conference will address that, but I will highlight a number of them, for example, the recommendation that more aspects of health be made a European competence and the recommendation that a greater focus be placed on where co-operation can deliver tangible results for European citizens.  Mr. O'Shea mentioned enthusiastic and idealistic young people.

It has come across in all of our engagements with this committee that there is a body of work to be done on the communication and explanation of the information to aid and increase greater understanding of the protocol both North and South and, in particular, east and west as well.  It is something that we will continue to do in our engagement work.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Richmond is correct about the direction of the EU and the Conference on the Future of Europe, and how we could perhaps increase the percentage of people in this country who believe the EU is moving in the right direction.  There are certainly some areas of the conference outcome and recommendations on which we feel more could be done.  The Deputy mentioned health competencies in particular.  A very interesting suggestion that came across not only in my own digital transformation working group work but also in the health working group was that the Covid vaccine pass and other such information could be uploaded very simply onto the European health insurance card.  That is a very practical measure that I hope can be examined.  There are many very good initiatives in terms of digital literacy and ensuring that no one is left behind, including having broadband access across the EU, financial literacy skills and how we combat misinformation and disinformation.  These are all very practical initiatives that came across from the conference that I hope will provide ideas for committee members, as elected representatives, to look to lead on initiatives and champion them.  We have seen that the desire and input are there.  It is very encouraging that people want to shape and influence what direction the European Union takes.<\/p> <p>  Treaty change and referendums are issues that we touched upon in our engagement this morning.  We do not believe treaty change should be a starting off point but, as Senator Chambers and Deputy Haughey stated, we have to be mindful of it.  We should not fear it, if it makes the European Union function more effectively.  However, there are mechanisms in place that can be used to make the EU more efficient and effective and do not necessarily necessitate treaty change.  We do not want to see an institutional tug-of-war take place over the EU's strategic direction.  There are areas I mentioned such as the Passerelle clause.  We should not just look for treaty change for the sake of it.  As we saw, there are always ways around some of the challenges.  We saw that with the approach taken during the Covid vaccine crisis, the health crisis and the fiscal compact.  There is precedent.  There is flexibility within the current treaties to accommodate individual positions, as we know only too well in Ireland.  We think some of the outcomes from the Conference on the Future of Europe process can be implemented and driven forward without too great a difficulty.  That is something that we are very strongly calling on all parties to the conference process to drive forward.  As we mentioned, we cannot afford to have an erosion of trust and confidence in the European Union and in the participatory parliamentary democracy process.  That would not benefit anyone.  What we have seen is that, politically, we have a more united European Union, one that represents the values on which it was founded.

We had a representative of North Macedonia before us last week.  We have learned a lot from our trip to Moldova and Romania.  Peripherality is an issue.  Many countries on the eastern side of Europe believe the region is getting attention now because of the war, which gives rise to the question of why the attention was not on it in the first place.<\/p> <p>  We could look at the inverse of that on the north-west coast of Ireland and the various percentages.

I thank the Chairman once again for the invitation to join the committee to discuss progress in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  As he mentioned, I am joined by Ms Rachel Kenna, chief nursing officer, Ms Margaret Campbell, principal officer in the strategic workforce planning area and Mr. Bob Patterson and Ms Grace O&rsquo;Regan, who work in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation division.<\/p> <p>  We have discussed previously our progress in meeting the challenge of Sl&aacute;intecare in terms of integrating health responses between the acute and community, and in delivering more care close to where patients live.<\/p><p>I am happy to report we are making progress.  Our enhanced community care programme continues to expand and develop as planned.  Ninety of the planned 96 community health networks are now established, as are 21 of 30 community specialist teams for older persons and 17 of 30 community specialist teams for chronic disease management, while 21 community intervention teams are now operational and securing national coverage.  One of the things we discussed previously was GP diagnostics.  Some 170,452 scans have been provided to end August 2022, which is a significant advance on the number provided last year.  We plan to expand this service further next year.<\/p><p> We remain on target in enhanced community care, ECC, recruitment.  Of the total target of 3,500, almost 1,900 have already commenced their roles, with a further 420 at an advanced stage of recruitment.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, we are currently at phase one of the regional health area, RHA implementation, which is focused on the high-level design of the service delivery model for the health and social care service - the organisational arrangements needed to deliver integrated models of care.  Six RHA streams have been established, focusing on clinical governance and accountability; finance, inclusive of population based resource allocation; digital and capital infrastructure; people and development; change, communications and culture; and programme co-ordination.  The work of the workstream groups will feed into an implementation plan that will be finalised by the end of the year.  Work has started on the development of a population-based approach to service planning and resource allocation.  A population-based resource allocation funding model will be part of the Estimates for 2024.  My Department recently published a spending review paper which provides an analysis across six countries to establish international best practice in this area to see how they can best inform our approach going forward.<\/p><p> The transition to RHAs will continue next year, with recruitment for senior posts starting as early as possible.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has established an advisory group of patient and staff representatives from across the health and social care sector who continue to engage and contribute to the development of this implementation plan.<\/p><p> Stakeholder consultation is key in developing the new structures for integrated care.  Several events have been held with health sector stakeholders to make sure what we are designing better enables integrated, patient-centred care.  This has included engagement with the HSE board and senior leaders within community healthcare organisations and hospital groups.  The Departments and the HSE are also involved in detailed engagement on regional health areas with the dialogue forum for voluntary organisations, and the engagement will continue.  Six regional events for employees are being held in September and October to gain input from staff in terms of this reform.<\/p><p> As regards the specific item on the agenda for this morning, and Mr. Reid will speak about this in a moment, we expect at this stage the increase in whole-time equivalents to be approximately 4,600 this year.  By the end of August, staffing levels show a growth of 2,600.  All staff categories are showing growth in the year to date with the largest increase seen in nursing and midwifery.  All nursing and midwifery graduates in the class of 2022 have been or are being offered permanent opportunities within our health system.<\/p><p> To supplement the national pool, the HSE has implemented a drive to source nurses and midwives from the international market.  As the committee will have seen from recent research published by the Department of Health, we must dramatically increase the numbers of nurses we train to reduce our reliance on such international recruitment.  This increase began over recent years, and we will have in place an additional 344 undergraduate training places for nurses and midwives.<\/p><p> The HSE has similarly directly targeted all the health and social care professional, HSCP, graduates from Irish colleges, and these applicants are being interviewed and will be offered jobs from October onwards.  To supplement the pool, international campaigns have been launched in a number of different areas, and the Department of Health is working with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to increase the number of HSCP students in Irish colleges over the years ahead.<\/p><p> Our capacity to recruit people is also an issue and significant activity is taking place.  Recruitment capacity has increased within the Public Appointments Service, particularly for the recruitment of medical consultants.  The HSE is also developing targeted initiatives to enhance the candidate pool, focusing especially on hard-to-fill posts.  In recognition of the scale of global competition for health care talent, the HSE has developed and implemented a globally competitive relocation package to attract international recruits to our service.<\/p><p> Working with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, we have succeeded in securing an extra 60 places on medical courses for Irish and EU students this year, with agreement to increase this by a total of 200 over the next four years, but even that announcement will not be sufficient.<\/p><p>We will have to increase the numbers much more and probably double the places we make available in the quickest timeframe possible.  We will need to look at different ways such as expanding or creating new schools, and all options we can to provide more opportunities for people who want to join this important profession.   As I say there is agreement to increase the places but I think we will need to go much further than that.  In common with other healthcare professions, the numbers of Irish and EU medical graduates we are producing is far short of the numbers we need to meet the healthcare needs of the service, as discussed before.  The demographic challenge is increasing demand all the time and we need to increase our workforce and train more people to participate into the future.  Clearly a big issue for us is to look at all opportunities to increase the number of graduates we produce domestically.  We are making progress on recruitment and reform, but obviously we need to accelerate this and I am very happy to take questions from members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Paul Reid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#F00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss a range of Sl&aacute;intecare programmes, and the issue of recruitment, retention and staff training, including the National Ambulance Service.  The Chair has introduced my colleagues in the room and those participating by video link so in the interests of time, I will not do so again.  Beginning with the enhanced community care programme, its objective in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, is to deliver increased levels of healthcare locally with service delivery reoriented towards general practice, primary care and community-based services. The programme has been allocated &euro;240 million for the establishment of 96 community health networks, 30 community specialist teams for older people and people with chronic diseases, to provide integrated services for people nearer to their homes.  To date 2,300 staff have either been recruited or are at advanced stage of recruitment.  A total of 90 of the planned 96 community health networks, 21 of the community specialist teams for older persons and 17 chronic disease specialist teams have already been established.  National coverage for the 21 community intervention teams has been achieved and a volunteer-type model in collaboration with ALONE is being rolled out, with 6,000 people now supported through this coordinated support mechanism.<\/p> <p>  A sum of &euro;25 million has been provided to deliver increased access to diagnostics for GPs, with 160,000 additional tests provided this year to date.  On the regional health areas, the HSE is continuing to take forward this key reform programme, working closely with the Department.  As outlined by Mr. Watt, phase one of regional health areas implementation is focused on high-level planning and design, in particular the service delivery model for the health and social care system and the organisational arrangements needed to deliver integrated care models.  Comprehensive communication and engagement processes are being progressed, including in recent weeks and as recently as yesterday.  Meetings continue with staff and with the voluntary dialogue forum and six major regional health events across community health organisation, CHO, hospital group staffs and other stakeholders throughout the country in Cork, Limerick, Sligo, Kilkenny, Tullamore and Dublin.<\/p> <p>  Addressing waiting lists is a key priority for the HSE.  Hospital groups have been supported to deliver additional in-year activity in 2022, with non-recurrent funding provided to deliver additional outpatient appointments, additional inpatient day-case procedures and additional scopes and diagnostics.  Additional longer term investment proposals have been submitted to the Department to support the implementation of 37 modernised scheduled care pathways and a number of hospital group priority investments to address recurring capacity gaps.  In the year to date the number of long waiting patients in outpatients has reduced by 19%, inpatients and day cases by 12%, and GI scopes by 65%.  Securing further progress on waiting list and waiting times will be a key priority for the HSE for the remainder of this year and beyond.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to emergency departments and our winter plan.  We continue to face significant levels of demand for unscheduled care services.  This year to date total emergency department attendances have increased by more than 5% compared to the same period in 2019, with attendances for outpatients aged 75 years and older increasing by 13%.  Emergency admissions have also increased, in particular for the over-75s.  The HSE is working very closely with the Department of Health to prepare for the winter plan 2022-23.  Key areas of focus will be enhancing the local injury units; overtime for staff to support out-of-hours services; transitional care funding; aids and appliances; complex packages of care; utilising private capacity; enhanced nurse staffing in emergency departments; enhanced consultant and registrar staffing in emergency departments; seasonal vaccinations; and communications to support public awareness.<\/p><p>Key areas of focus will be enhancing the local injury units, overtime for staff to support out-of-hours services, transitional care funding, aids and appliances, complex packages of care, utilising private capacity, enhanced nurse staffing in emergency departments, enhanced consultant and registrar staffing in emergency departments, seasonal vaccinations and communications to support public awareness.<\/p><p> On recruitment, retention and training, an area in which the committee is particularly interested, the HSE is working on a range of actions to ensure the effectiveness of our recruitment efforts.  Short-term actions are focused on hard-to-fill posts, including recruitment and retention of Irish trained graduates, extended international recruitment campaigns, an easy-to-use, streamlined application process, widening of the skills list and overseas relocation packages.  Medium to longer term actions are focused on increasing domestic supply and working towards greater self-sufficiency.  In the year to date, HSE staffing levels have increased by some 2,700 whole-time equivalents.  In the period since the beginning of 2020, the HSE workforce has grown by more than 15,000 staff.<\/p><p> As the largest employer in the State, the HSE has an extensive and broad offering of training and development programmes delivered both nationally and locally.  These programmes are tailored for both clinical and non-clinical staff.  Nationally there are over 300 programmes available via HSeLanD.  A further 410 are available under leadership learning and talent management programmes and further programmes are delivered by the HSE leadership academy.  There is also a range of profession-specific programmes delivered across the country.<\/p><p> The National Ambulance Service college delivers training to staff through education and competency assurance officers, both within the college and across the service.  Sixty-two new paramedics qualified from the National Ambulance Service college in August 2022.  The National Ambulance Service continues to actively recruit new staff throughout the year and in March 2022 launched a rolling advertising campaign for qualified paramedics, student paramedics and intermediate care operatives.  To date, this has secured 161 new recruits.<\/p><p> The processing of the pandemic special recognition payment continues to receive priority across all hospitals and community services.  Some 123,000 employees have received the payment, 85,000 of whom are in HSE statutory organisations and 38,000 in section 38 organisations.  The HSE is working with the Department of Health to take forward the payment of recognition awards to staff working in other organisations included within the organisation types covered by the Government decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":572,"content":"<p>On Mr. Reid's final point, he referred to 123,000 workers in the HSE and section 38 organisations who received the pandemic recognition payment.

On the development of healthcare in the community, I want to give an example of where it is not working.  I have a case of a 79-year-old who was in hospital with Covid for three months.  He lives on his own and has impaired vision.  Six weeks after coming out of hospital, he still had not been visited by a public health nurse or anyone else from the HSE.<\/p><p>He ended up back in hospital with a kidney infection for a further four days.  I am wondering about the connectivity out there in the community.  Is it really happening especially with people who are discharged from hospital?  This is not a rural area, this is in an urban area.  How can something like that happen when we are supposed to have more people now working within the community?<\/p><p> I want to check the issue as regards working with GPs.  The workload of GPs has increased dramatically in the past two years in particular.  We are now rolling out the extension of the free GP service for under-7s.  I am not clear whether there has been direct engagement with GPs on this extension.  The big issue that GPs have is the lack of support in terms of having nurses employed.  When one compares with the UK there is probably one nurse for every GP employed in a practice.  We do not have the same ratio here.  My understanding here is that in one GP practice with six GPs there are only moneys available for one nurse.  Are we looking at expanding that?  If we want to keep more and more people out of the hospital system we need to increase the level of services provided in the community.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#G00800","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Mr. Watt may want to comment on some of the policy issues.

It is fair to say that some areas are more mature than others both in terms of the step-down process and integration between the hospital and the community.  Some of my colleagues who work in services might want to comment.  What we have seen are significant extra resources working between the acute hospitals.  For example, consultant geriatricians are now working part-time in the community, that is half their time in the community and half their time through what we call the integrated care for older persons process.

Tom comes to the accident and emergency department.  He has had a fall, he is seen and it is found he has fractured his hip.  He goes into surgery and gets seen there.  There is then a discharge programme and co-ordination where he is discharged back into the community.  He is seen by the consultant geriatrician, because in Community Healthcare West, which is Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, we have four integrated care programmes for older people, each of which programmes has a consultant geriatrician.  There are clinical nurse specialists, CNSs, occupational therapists, OTs, and physiotherapists, who are multidisciplinary and work closely with GPs.  Tom goes back into the community but needs a little bit of transitional care.  He goes into one of our ICPOP beds in one of our community nursing units and is then discharged after four weeks with a follow-up plan and with multidisciplinary teams involved.<\/p> <p>  Another situation is that of Ambrose, who has fallen but, thankfully, has not sustained a fracture.  He does not need to go into hospital, so he is sent back into the community instead to be seen by a consultant geriatrician.  He gets four weeks' transitional care in one of our care homes and is then discharged into the community with a follow-up, which would be multidisciplinary and would involve physiotherapists and OTs, depending on his presentation.  He is seen and is looked after in the community and his family are supported with respite and home support.<\/p> <p>  That is the way it works.  If somebody is in hospital, there is great integration between the hospital and the community.  There are weekly discharge meetings and we look at what supports a person needs.  We also have frailty at the front door.  For example, last month in Galway, 133 people were seen in the accident and emergency department and we saved 236 bed days.  Again, that was supported through community, step-down, transitional care beds, and being seen by consultants and by the multidisciplinary staff.  That is the way it works.<\/p> <p>  There is also home support, and people get the home care packages they require, including aids and appliances and adaptations to their homes, which sometimes involves the local authorities.  That is a very quick synopsis of the way it works between the hospital and the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Crehan-Roche"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy Burke and I will follow that up directly.

We have rehearsed some of those over the past year at various meetings of this committee and other committees of the Oireachtas.  Children's disability network teams are probably staffed at about 70% at this point.  We have a problem with recruiting staff into these teams.  In mental health we have a dire shortage of consultant psychiatrists, psychologists and staff in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  We have a real challenge right across mental health services in recruiting staff.  Using the hours we have funded for home help is a major challenge because we cannot recruit the staff to provide them.  We have a lot of challenges in those areas and I do not see a plan that tells me we will solve these issues.<\/p> <p>  I will give one example that makes the mind boggle.  I asked a parliamentary question about what interventions the disability section of the HSE will make to try to fill the positions in the children's disability network teams and how it will recruit more staff.  The HSE stated it was looking at sponsorship programmes, apprenticeships and assistant therapy grades to help.<\/p><p>I then put a question to HR in the HSE.  They come back to say they are not looking at sponsorships, apprenticeships and assistant therapy grades. So which is it?  When one arm of the HSE is saying it is going to do something and another is saying it is not, that does not fill me with confidence.  Could Mr. Reid address that point first because we have had several exchanges on this at the children's committee and other committees?  We have to deal with parents of children with disabilities and those children themselves who are waiting for access to therapies.  We all know how difficult and challenging it is, yet the staff cannot be recruited.  I do not see the urgency and I do not see the plan.  Perhaps he might enlighten us as to whether there have been any changes in the past couple of months.  These are the areas that we need to drill down into and examine the shortfalls of staff are and the positions cannot be filled and the impact it is having on the end-user and the patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#L01000","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. McCallion, who has taken up the role of chief operations officer at the HSE and who has put a priority on disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I accept that children's teams are below 70% in terms of numbers, particularly with regard to therapies.

It is very dislocating when that happens, as seniors are concerned about their files and access to their files, etc.  It may not be something worth worrying about, having spoken to other GPs when they have taken them on; if there is an issue, they will put them through a raft of tests.  I am confident about that.<\/p><p>In Templeogue, the only option for people on the general medical services, GMS, scheme was Nutgrove.  It is a long way to travel.  It is something to look at.  A number of GPs are not taking over-70s, which creates challenges.  This is going to happen.  A number of GPs have retired, there have been bereavements and other issues that have caused a lot dislocation, particularly concerning patient files.  It is a big issue for patients when a GP retires or their GP practice closes.  They ask: &quot;What happened my file?&quot; or &quot;Is it my file or the GP's file?&quot;  I would like to log that with Mr. Reid, along with the issue of not taking GMS patents aged over 70.<\/p><p>I would like a note on the primary care centre in Ballyboden.  We fought for this.  It took a decade to get this over the line.  It is a spanking new facility.  I do not think that GPs are <i>in situ<\/i>there.  That is an issue.  I would appreciate if I could get a note on that.<\/p><p>I would like to address my final question to both the Secretary General and the CEO.  What is the percentage of unpaid hospital fees?

It is very hard to comprehend a situation where the State is spending &euro;23 billion on the health service and we find ourselves year on year with money allocated for different services and the HSE incapable of recruiting people because there has been little or no forward planning in relation to workforce.  It beggars belief that given the level of unmet need in the country, our biggest problem in the health service is that we cannot get staff.  We are talking about international recruitment but there are ethical issues around international recruitment.  There is also the madness in what is happening with hospital doctors, where at huge expense we are training them to leave this country, and then trying to scramble around to get foreign doctors to keep our service together.  One has to ask why there is not a clear, robust workforce plan for this year, for the next five to ten years and a plan for the next 20 to 30 years.  All of these projections are available in terms of population growth, the kind of numbers that will be needed across health and social care.  Why is that not being done and who is responsible for not doing it?  That is the question.  It is the most fundamental thing you would have in a major organisation with that kind of massive budget.  I just cannot get my head around it.  Why is it not happening?  We have heard comments about how we have succeeded in getting an extra 60 medical places.  This should not be a concession.  We have succeeded in getting some extra places but it is not anything like enough.  That is paraphrasing what has been said by Mr. Watt.  Why is it not enough?  Why have we not got the figures set out over the next 20 to 30 years?  <\/p><p>I spoke to the <font color=\"#202124\">Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science<\/font>, Deputy Harris, about this, because I am gobsmacked at the extent to which our health service is not functioning and so many members of the public are denied access to essential health and social care because of the failure to plan.  He said he is more than happy to extend the number of places in third level colleges if he gets some figures from the Department or the HSE.  There are four key areas that need attention and we should be able to set down on paper what the needs are and what the plan is to ensure adequate numbers of staff over the coming years.  I do not think such a plan exists.  There is no evidence of it, and I have to ask why that is the case.  In any major organisation recruitment, forward planning and doing the projections is just basic work.  <\/p><p>The first issue is the adequacy of the number of third level places.  This is a matter of doing sums and working out what numbers of different categories of staff will be needed over the coming years.  There is then the question of work placements and I would like Mr. Reid to address that issue in particular, because my understanding of the situation is that for healthcare staff work placements are absolutely critical.<\/p><p>They are a major part of the whole training process.  My understanding is that, within the HSE, the number of placements has been reduced substantially in recent years.  That is causing part of the logjam.  Clearly, not much attention is being paid to the work experience of people in the health service, where, for example, junior hospital doctors are leaving this country in droves.  GPs cannot set up in practice because they do not have the money behind them, and we were promised salaried GPs.  We also know that many people right across the health service do not have very good experiences of working within the HSE and prefer to go to other places where there are functioning health services.<\/p><p> The other issue that needs to be addressed is CORU; I think CORU has to be seen as part of the problem.  Why is it taking so long to recognise people's qualifications?  There is a whole area there that seems to have been completely neglected in recent years.<\/p><p> There was a time when doctors were seen to be the only people in the health service and should be the key decision makers.  They certainly were in a very prominent position in the Department of Health.  There was an extraordinary reverence towards them.  About ten years ago, there was finally recognition of the important role of nursing and the Chief Nursing Officer was appointed on a par with the Chief Medical Officer.  That was a very important development.  We know that nurses should be on a par with doctors.<\/p><p> There is another area of staff, health and social care professionals, to which I would ask Mr. Watt to give serious consideration.  These are essential people within the health service, especially as we move to implement Sl&aacute;intecare and a different model of care within the community.  There are major shortages of health and social care workers.  Some of that has been referred to already, where money was provided in recent years for mental health services and disability services.  It is a joke that the money is there and we cannot get the people.  I would put it to Mr. Watt that consideration should be given to appointing a chief officer for health and social care professionals, to bring them on a par with nursing and medical professionals.  This is going to be a huge area that needs to grow substantially if we are serious about patient-centred care.  Has Mr. Watt given consideration to the appointment of such an officer at senior management level within his Department?<\/p><p> I want both organisations to respond to this point.  Both organisations, and I would also include the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, should be on top of this issue.  They should have very clear plans for training places, placements, all of those things, and ensuring that when people are working in the service, they are treated properly, so we do not have a situation like what is happening with junior doctors.  Why is this not happening?  Can both organisations provide an explanation as to why it is not happening?  Are there plans to put in place a proper workforce plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#Q00600","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":668,"content":"<p>In 2020 and 2021, we had the largest increases - in those two years - ever in the number of people in the health system.

To reassure the Deputy, there is a forward planning function and strategic planning function within the HSE.  We would not have been able to recruit - and I know she is not interested in the numbers - but for us to stand alone in any given year and just stay net or stay the same, we need to recruit 10,000 people.  We have recruited 15,200 people since January 2020 above that each year.  We require 10,000 to stand still, but have achieved a 15,000 net increase.  To demonstrate the mix, the strategic element of that has been to get the mix right and better as regards the predominant services.  I am happy the mix of recruitment in the HSE has fundamentally changed.  That includes 2,300 health and social care professionals, 4,500 nurses and midwives.  That is the highest number ever achieved.  For the first time ever in the past three years, every graduate nurse is guaranteed an appointment in the HSE.  That has never happened before.  The mix has fundamentally shifted because of strategic recruitment and forward planning.  We have a dedicated unit in the HSE on strategic recruitment.  We put in a new recruitment model, which includes a combination of in-house and an outsourced model to help us recruit.  We have delegated certain levels and grades within that mix of recruitment to the regions and the CHOs and we engage in forward planning.  We have fundamentally changed the recruitment model in the HSE and we would not have achieved the numbers we have achieved without the forward planning function.

I have been involved in issues around health for years, after working in the Department of Finance since 2008 and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform since 2011.  It is the same narrative every year but it needs to be much more sophisticated than that.  We need to talk about ways of work and work practice reforms.  Dr. Colm Henry is not here today but he is leading on the clinical pathways, which Ms Goff touched on, and improved ways of working, the shift to the left and the embrace of technology.  We spoke about this last time.  Given demographic change, the demand in the health system is going up by 3% or 4%.  That is a doubling of the demand in 18 or 20 years.  No country, including this one, will be able to meet those demands by increase in workforce alone.

It has to be about the reforms and the different ways of doing things.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned FEMPI and the outstanding issues with the consultant body.

First of all, in the national service planning process and in the Estimates process we do look at demographics, at existing levels of services and at inflation.  All of that modelling is done at the Estimates process and it is further done in the national service planning process in the allocation of funding.  Consider in particular the last couple of years and this year.  If we talk to people in the NHS in Scotland, in Northern Ireland, and in the UK - and I have spoken to them - and if one speaks to those in the Dutch health service, the reality is that every health service has been hit by some unknowns coming from Covid.  First of all there was Covid itself, and the volume of activity it has driven.  Second, there is some of the delayed care that we are seeing coming from it.  Third, we are seeing a higher frailty level of older persons.  I gave a figure, probably last week.  I was in the University Hospital Waterford two weeks ago.  I walked the wards in a 450 bed hospital where 270 of the patients were over the age of 75.  That is what we are seeing, and it would not have been predicted to the level we are seeing.  Modelling is being done by Dr. Colm Henry and others in the Department that looks at the frailty rate of a 76-year-old person now versus the frailty rate of a 76-year-old person two years ago.  Certainly it has deteriorated.  There is modelling that we do but there are things that happen that impact on our services.  Certainly with older persons I would say that the biggest challenge we are facing in the health service in the next ten years - not 20 or 30 years - is higher frailty challenges in older persons.  Thankfully we have a health system and a country where people live longer than any of the EU averages, one of the highest rates in the OECD and much higher than in the UK.  We have longer life, we have higher complexity and we have higher frailty.  It is going to put further pressure on the funding streams and the health system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":786,"content":"<p>The only problem with that is I have been hearing for 20 years that 2038 would be the real hit year.

There would probably still be an overrun, but not to the extent that would exactly match the underspend arising from the staff costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#CC01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":811,"content":"<p>The estimate at the moment is an additional &euro;1 billion.<\/p> <p>  When is the Department going to announce the winter programme?

That depends on the prevalence of various respiratory diseases.  The flu season in the southern hemisphere was quite severe this year and there is always the potential for Covid to re-emerge.  We are anticipating a difficult winter.  As Mr. Reid and the team can confirm, we have had a high level of attendances and admissions in emergency departments during the traditionally quieter times of the year and that reflects the higher population over the age of 75 with greater needs and higher levels of frailty.  Nobody can predict the demand but we expect it will be higher, which will add pressure.<\/p> <p>  The teams, particularly Mr. Reid, Mr. McCallion and so on, are working intensively to prepare for this.  A plan is in draft and the Minister hopes to bring it to Government next week or the week after that for publication as soon as possible, given the winter season is starting and the cold is starting to set in.  There are two aspects of the plan, namely, the traditional winter planning, for which there will be additional money, which the Minister mentioned yesterday in the budget, and the benefits from the higher recruitment and increase in capacity we have seen in recent years, which will help the system in responding.  In addition to the traditional winter plan, the CMO is making recommendations to the Minister in regard to the vaccination policy and measures people can take to keep themselves safe during winter.<\/p> <p>  There is a variety of measures, with a significant endeavour to mitigate the effects on the system as best we can.

There were elements of bed capacity in the winter plans of the past two years and through the 2022 service plan.  The total number of beds funded across that was about 1,150, of which more than 900 have been delivered.  A further 154 will happen before the end of the year and the balance in 2023.<\/p> <p>  Turning to University Hospital Galway, throughout the Saolta University Health Care Group, 83 additional beds are planned, of which 12 are due to open.  I do not have the specific figures for Galway hospital but Saolta as a group, as the Senator will be aware, covers the hospitals in Castlebar, Portiuncula, Sligo and Letterkenny.  I can revert to him with the exact numbers for Galway hospital.<\/p><p>Alongside acute bed capacity, one of the areas of focus for the winter is the vaccination which, as Mr. Reid said, is crucial.  We saw the impact of low vaccination rates in our hospitals with Covid-19 during the pandemic so we are really urging people to get vaccinated.  We have a big campaign starting around that.  The second area is acute capacity but also the community bed capacity.  The third piece then is to leverage some of the existing investments we talked about earlier in terms of the community with the older persons teams, in particular, and our chronic disease teams.  Fourth, we are looking to put in additional capacity and resource for simple things that can sometimes clog up the system or packages of care, aids and appliances, which are things we know we need to use more of in the winter.  They are also forming part of the final discussions to which the Secretary General referred.  Lastly then we have looked at initiatives within each geographical area, which may vary.<\/p><p> My colleague, Ms Crehan-Roche, in Galway may also want to comment on this in terms of the other local resources that would most help make the maximum impact in what we know may be a very severe winter this year.  We are trying to plan for the worst-case scenario as best we can but it is more than just acute bed capacity.  We are working with Galway regularly.  Ms Crehan-Roche might want to comment on one or two of the specific local initiatives in Galway as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#DD00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":818,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCallion.

In the main, we do not have a physiotherapy service in Clifden because of difficulties in recruiting somebody for that position or retaining somebody in that position.  The physiotherapist left in 2021 and has not been replaced.  This is having a knock-on effect where we have a facility with staff, beds and capacity.

It may be possible to catch them to present them with an opportunity.  We do a similar thing with consultants.  When we were looking for emergency department consultants recently, we put out feelers around the world to make contact with people who have roots from Ireland and might come back.

I apologise as I should have clarified the matter.  There are 12 beds in Galway and ten delivered.  However, a change that is happening in the emergency department infrastructure there may facilitate better flow in relation to some of the beds and release some capacity.  Although Covid is clearly changed, we still have Covid pathways in hospital.  Having visited an emergency department recently, I know we still have to have those separate pathways and testing.  It still impacts on our flow in hospitals.  Some of that will also help to give some benefit.<\/p> <p>  On the acute capacity, it is important that we have put in much capacity in recent years.

When will there be engagement on dealing with those challenges so that there are no further closures?<\/p> <p>  The second matter I wish to raise relates to workforce planning.  There was reference to the shortage of nurses.  I understand that some private hospitals are now training people specifically as theatre assistants.  Those staff are not qualified nurses but they are specifically trained as theatre assistants.  That is happening in other jurisdictions as well.  Is that approach being considered?  <\/p> <p>  My final point is that nurses are highly qualified yet they are still doing a lot of work that care assistants could be doing.  That is not taking from care assistants.  In fairness to nurses, they are well qualified now.  In fact, many junior doctors will say it is nurses who are doing an awful lot of their training because nurses have so much experience and skill.  Is the issue of nurses' responsibilities and delegating some of that work down to care assistants being considered in the whole realignment?  Similarly, is the issue of theatre assistants being considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#HH00200","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":846,"content":"<p>As regards theatre assistants, we are looking at the development of roles that will support nurses, midwives and doctors in practice.  As the Deputy noted, theatre assistants are well integrated internationally into acute settings, and other types of assistants into community settings as well.  It is part of our strategic outlook in terms of policy direction to look at these and other roles.  Physician assistants are currently being trained here through the RCSI and are employed in some hospitals through the HSE.  These roles are not new to our workforce planning and they are being considered in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of nurses being highly qualified, the Deputy is correct.  Our success in terms of advanced practice is testament to the skills, knowledge and expertise of our nursing and midwifery workforces.  In supporting that, there has been an increase.  We have a policy target now of 3% of our entire nursing and midwifery work force being at advanced practice level.  This year, with the additional 149 posts that are currently in the process of final recruitment, we will be at 2.25% of our workforce.  We have achieved significant growth at the higher level of practice, at the top of the licence for nurses and midwives.<\/p><p>To support that, part of the expert review on nursing and midwifery will look at the implementation of the recent healthcare assistant review that was done in 2019.  That is about the support and development of healthcare assistant roles within and throughout the service.

In essence that is it.  To be frank, this morning I said that we negotiated an increase in the number of places by 200, from 720 up to almost 900.  Mr. Reid mentioned earlier the population and the greater frailty of older people.  All of the Deputies this morning spoke about individual cases in their constituencies.

It is about keeping them here.  We have junior doctors who are threatening strike action.  There is a myriad of contractual issues in healthcare, which have been in train or in play for many years and there are issues that are unresolved.  We can train as many as we like but if we cannot recruit them and retain them, it is equally as challenging.  Of course we need to train more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092800002#JJ01100","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":858,"content":"<p>It is something we could set out in the note.

Clearly there is an issue around retention.  There is an issue around the non-consultant hospital doctors and a working group has been established to address various working conditions there, which we are all aware of with regard to hours, rosters, and the moving around in a way that is not necessarily family friendly.<\/p><p>So, absolutely, the Minister has made it clear on this.  I will use that dreadful expression \"multifaceted\", but there are a number of different areas here.  To be perfectly frank, I admit that in the past, there has been a failure to properly plan in terms of workforce.  Absolutely.  We have responded, particularly in the last year or two, but we need to do better.  There needs to be a step change, whether that involves a radical expansion of the capacity of the existing medical schools in Ireland, or whether it requires a complete reorientation of the model, or whether we need to establish new medical schools.  I was very interested in comments made recently, they may have been by Alistair Darling, but by a former Secretary for Health in the UK.  He talked about his ambitions and realised that even when they doubled the number of places there, it still was not enough.  The western developed world is thankfully facing a success - as Mr. Reid mentioned earlier - which is our life expectancy.  It is currently one of the highest in the EU.  The increase in life expectancy is, of course, a positive but it does link to a very different type of model of care than that in the past, and the demands are just very different.  We are going to have to do that.  We definitely welcome that.

Who in the Department or the HSE does the buck actually stop with for planning?  Is Mr. Watt satisfied that there is sufficient capacity to do that necessary workforce planning?

As director of the Royal Irish Academy of Music, RIAM, I run a national performing arts school which trains musicians who aspire to performing careers in classical music, musical theatre and popular music or as teachers, academics, journalists, broadcasters and more.  I am joined today by RIAM alumnus and musical theatre director, S&eacute;im&iacute; Campbell.<\/p> <p>  I would like to give my perspective on the current status and future possibilities of musical theatre education in Ireland by outlining RIAM&rsquo;s current offer and drawing on selected international comparisons.  I will address the context for employment of musical theatre graduates in Ireland.  I will also make recommendations to the committee on a possible way forward to support the musical theatre education.<\/p> <p>  I define musical theatre education as the training of singers, instrumentalists, directors, musical directors and composers for the professional world, for instance, a commercial West End show.<\/p> <p>  Examples of Irish successes in this field include RIAM alumnus and London-based director, S&eacute;im&iacute; Campbell, Olivier and Oscar-winning performer, Jessie Buckley, and musical theatre composer, orchestrator and musical director, Cian McCarthy.  While it is wonderful to see Irish talent such as this on the international stage, the musical theatre scene in Ireland at professional level is dominated by the West End shows which are bought in by venues such as the Bord G&aacute;is Energy Theatre using casts recruited in the UK.  While there is a burgeoning Irish musical theatre scene in less commercial arenas, which I can speak about in more detail, predominantly we are looking at musical theatre education in Ireland as training our artists for export, while indigenous commercial shows are not financially viable against this strong competition.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the limited scope for employment in Ireland as a full-time musical theatre professional, in my experience, the market for musical theatre education is strong.  Both the RIAM and Lir Academy, our fellow associate college of Trinity College Dublin, annually receive applications from many young people whose dream is to have a career in musical theatre.  Our main constraint in taking them in is in the most part due to number caps.  Each institution currently can only take in six singers or 16 actors each per year at undergraduate level.  Another constraint is the current predominant focus of our courses on classical music and theatre.  We hope to expand this intake and build on our current musical theatre offer, which I will outline next.<\/p> <p>  In explaining RIAM&rsquo;s current offer and future vision for musical theatre education, I will describe it at three levels: pre-college; undergraduate; and postgraduate.  For pre-college, over the past four years RIAM alumnus and dynamic musical theatre director, S&eacute;im&iacute; Campbell, has partnered with RIAM to create Irish Youth Musical Theatre, an organisation which develops master classes for school- and college-age performers with West End, mostly Irish, professionals and which culminated in July of this year in a semi-staged performance of \"Evita\" in the National Concert Hall with the National Symphony Orchestra.  The Irish Youth Musical Theatre master classes and annual youth productions are invaluable for young people who wish to decide on their future, similar to work experience for transition year students. <\/p> <p>  For our undergraduate education offer, RIAM's bachelor in music vocal and instrumental students, although they are primarily classically trained, have modules available in musical theatre performance, including voice training improvisation, jazz and popular styles.  The uptake on these specialist modules is increasing and we are in the early stages of discussion with the Lir Academy to pool resources and offer more in this area.<\/p><p> At postgraduate level, we have no current offer and I am not aware of any postgraduate offer in Ireland.  Our inspiration for the further development of musical theatre at this level is the Royal Academy of Music, RAM, in London and its master of arts in musical theatre programme.  Like ourselves, the RAM started out in classical music education but has established one of the most successful musical theatre departments in the UK.  Catering only at masters level, the students perform as a company and put on a series of staged productions in one intensive year around which a team of experts give the training.  It is our dream in the academy in Dublin to create a masters programme of this level and standing.<\/p><p> One key strength for the RIAM in achieving this goal is the opening of our new campus next month.  This spectacular performing arts hub was made possible with significant funding jointly given by the Departments of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  This was matched by some of Ireland and the USA&rsquo;s most respected philanthropists.  With thanks to that &euro;25 million support, we now have the right standard of infrastructure in place to develop new streams of education, such as a postgraduate degree musical theatre, and we are excited about our future.<\/p><p> I have one recommendation to put forward to the committee.  RIAM is not the only institution in Ireland with ambitions in developing musical theatre education.  If the committee wishes support a case to Government that Irish-based musical theatre education should be adequately resourced, I suggest that it further recommend that additional and targeted Government funds are tendered for competitively by any interested and eligible third level college.<\/p><p> I have recently served on a specialist panel for the Office for Students in the UK which assessed all eligible UK-based performing arts schools that were seeking additional funding from an overall amount ring-fenced by Government.  This competitive process had metrics that were objectively evaluated by industry experts and was therefore fair and transparent.  Such a tender could include a business and financial plan, a curriculum outline, a statement of existing resources and infrastructure, the professional standing and industry experience of proposed teaching talent, and the track record of the institutions applying as a predictor of their future success.<\/p><p> Ireland has a world-class reputation for the performing arts and this competitive process would ensure that musical theatre education, which is such an important part of our arts, would be further developed to that high standard.  I hope this overview from the RIAM&rsquo;s perspective has been of help, and welcome the opportunity to provide further information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Good afternoon everyone.  It is my pleasure and privilege to be invited to Leinster House and I thank the Cathaoirleach for the invitation and opportunity to talk to the joint committee about the future of musical theatre in Ireland.  I also acknowledge Irish playwright, Mr. Billy Roche, West End performer, Mr. Killian Donnelly, representatives from the Association of Irish Musical Societies and The Royal Irish Academy of Music and welcome their contribution to this area of discussion which we all feel very passionately about.<\/p> <p>  My campaign can be broken down into three aspects.  The first is the acknowledgement of musical theatre as an art form and an entity in its own right and that it be funded accordingly, using similar templates as is currently recognised for opera, theatre and dance in this country.  The second aspect is we should consider creating and providing a national musical theatre company with suitable platforms for our professional musical theatre practitioners, musicians, composers, lyricists, creatives and production teams.  The third aspect is that we should highlight what this art form represents with respect to the immense potential it could create in the form of further employment, revenue, tourism and educational possibilities.<\/p> <p>  It is important to define what musical or musical theatre is.  A musical is a stage, television or film production that combines music, acting and dance and utilises popular-style songs to tell a story.  It can trace its roots back to religious rituals of prehistoric humankind and has been a celebrated and popular art form from the dramas of ancient Greece right through to current Broadway and West End productions.  Though musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements.<\/p> <p>  As a professional opera singer and vocal coach, I was horrified and surprised to learn there was nothing available for a student wishing to study musical theatre at third level a decade ago.  The only option of emigration for further studies involved incurring huge financial costs.  As a result, I established the Irish College of Music Theatre in 2011 to provide Ireland's first third level musical theatre courses in business partnership with the then Dublin Institute of Technology.  I now act as director of musical theatre at American College Dublin and deliver degree and masters programmes where I am proud to promote ten years of successful Irish alumni gracing national and international.  However, the harsh reality is we are now training our students to emigrate on completion of their studies.  It is sad to advise that the only way we can see our home-grown perform is by travelling to the West End or further afield, or perchance our graduates are employed by an overseas touring company returning to perform in one of the many sold-out performances presented at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre.  This will be further discussed by Mr. Donnelly from the West End via video link.<\/p> <p>  To close, I appeal for us to acknowledge musical theatre for the wonderful art form it is, create a national musical theatre company, nurture and provide for our home-grown talent and in turn create employment, pride and lots of entertainment for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Masterson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":910,"content":"<p>My day job for the last 30 years has been as a second level teacher working in the area of school shows and also community theatre in Inchicore, Dublin 8.  For almost 60 years the AIMS has been the governing body for 120 musical societies based in the Thirty-two Counties on the island of Ireland.  We have more than 15,000 members performing in on average 800 productions a year from full scale musicals to concerts and pantomimes.  Our audiences average 1.2 million.  Although we are seen as an amateur organisation, we stage shows to a very professional standard with an average cost of &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000.  We also employ many technicians, musicians, directors, and choreographers.  That is along with lighting operators, sound technicians, set builders and painters, costume suppliers, props, hair and make-up crews, stage crews, front-of-house teams and kitchen staff - the list is endless.  There could be an average of 120 people working on every production.  Our societies perform in theatres, community halls and schools nationwide.  Our societies are a vital part of local communities and are sometimes the first introduction to Broadway or West End shows.<\/p> <p>  Live theatre and live entertainment is vital in every community in today&rsquo;s society.  It is an opportunity for audiences to socialise, meet friends and family, get out of the house, have somewhere to go, switch off and be entertained.  It is also a chance for all members to do the same but also to learn a craft and be educated, be it in singing, dancing, acting or staying fit while also making friends.  Most societies rehearse a production for an average of three months, which in many cases carries them through the cold and bleak winter months.  Being part of a group, be it sporting or artistic, is so important and is very positive for mental health.<\/p><p>The impact of the Covid pandemic on amateur theatre and amateur musical theatre has been devastating all over the island of Ireland over the past couple of years.  For all involved, the absence of this platform created a huge void in towns and villages throughout the country.  Putting on stage activities in the autumn and winter periods is to a community what sporting activities are in the summer period.  These activities galvanise a community, not just local communities but neighbouring communities, as they support one another in these activities, creating a complex web of social and cultural interaction and networking that is unique to Irish society.  After the shutdown due to Covid, I am delighted to say we are now slowly returning to the stage.  With 42 societies back on stage last season, we are expecting the return of upwards of 85 societies this season between June 2022 and June 2023.  Our participants range in age from infants to people in their 80s.  It embraces all age groups, irrelevant of class, gender, orientation, religion or creed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":912,"content":"<p>We are before the committee today to discuss the future of musical theatre in Ireland.  Some other speakers here are more qualified professionally in that regard, but I would like to speak about my own personal experiences if that is okay.  I moved to Arklow from Drogheda in 1996.  It was a town that had no musical society.  I joined the local society, Avonmore Musical Society, purely as a way of making friends, but it completely changed my life and I am still there 26 years later.<\/p> <p>  I had never been on stage, sang, danced or acted before, but now I have taken part in every show since.  I learned how to sing, dance and act, gained loads of confidence, and served on committees in a variety of roles from committee member to PRO and to chairperson.  Now I address the committee as national chairperson of AIMS.  My job and that of all involved in AIMS is to continue the growth of our organisation and the musical theatre education of all our members.<\/p> <p>  As said, I started my musical theatre education when I was 21 years old, but I am delighted to say many our members are being educated in musical theatre from a very young age through a variety of dance schools, stage schools, choirs, many music festivals and mainstream schooling.  We accept members of our society from the young age of six, depending on the need for them in various productions, and we have many members of transition year age and onwards.  However, we do not encourage members to partake if they are in school exam years.<\/p> <p>  For over 20 years, AIMS has been running a youth summer school in Thurles, County Tipperary.  The school is a week-long residential course for members aged between 15 and 18 during which they work with a director, musical director and choreographer, and stage a concert at the end of the course.  We are proud to say some of our past members have gone on to star in and work on many West End shows and even appear in Hollywood movies.  I am delighted to say that many of our members have gone on to join musical societies in third level colleges around Ireland with some even forming new musical societies there where none existed.<\/p> <p>  Travelling to the UK used to be the most common educational route for many of our members but I am delighted that now there are college courses available in Ireland that enable our young people to stay in Ireland to pursue their musical theatre careers.  AIMS is proud to offer two bursaries each year along with the Anne O&rsquo;Neill Bursary to help some of our members to progress their careers in college.  We are also delighted to be able to offer a collaborative scholarship with American College Dublin for an AIMS member wishing to study musical theatre at third level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Donnelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":913,"content":"<p>One of the positives for AIMS during Covid was that musical theatre was finally recognised by the Arts Council.  We would like to thank Niall Doyle and all his staff in the Arts Council for the help and support given to us and especially for the much-needed funding, which we hope will continue in the years ahead.  This funding enabled us to put in place a mentoring and performance critical appraisal pilot scheme, which is currently running among our societies and will be complete in summer 2023.<\/p> <p>  We would like to develop this programme for the entire musical theatre sector, including in education and schools, to educate and develop this sector with a tailor-made programme suitable for school musical theatre performances.  This will be carried out on an AIMS regional basis, with regional-based mentors in place.  This input with professional and experienced mentors will greatly benefit schools and young people as well as enhance the standard of performances in school musical theatre in their local community and further help the musical theatre sector as the students move into third level education and the professional sector.<\/p> <p>  With the committee's support, we hope that the role of musical theatre education can be protected, nurtured and helped to continue growing.  I am excited to hear that there are changes coming not only in the junior cycle, with artistic performance as a short module, but in the leaving certificate curriculum, including a new subject, namely drama, film and theatre studies.  I hope musical theatre could be a part of this new subject and especially artistic performance.  As stated, many secondary schools already perform and stage full musicals annually.  Having musical theatre added as part of this subject would be very beneficial.

Hopefully it will show that what can be done.  It is a commercial title, based on something we all know and love.  It is our responsibility to show audiences what theatre and musical theatre can do.  RT&Eacute; can do it because it is our national broadcaster.  It is a massive risk and it is incredibly brave of RT&Eacute; to do it.  How can our national theatres and freelance producers take similar risks and we cannot?  They are viewed as being commercial and that is why we do not get funding for all of the new work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;im&iacute; Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1664319600,"counter":921,"content":"<p>How would Mr. Donnelly see himself performing more often on an Irish stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#C01100","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":922,"content":"<p>It would probably be if I was employed by a British producer in a production that was coming to Ireland, as happened three or four years ago when I was playing the role of Jean Valjean in <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables<\/i>.

Bryan Flynn, who wrote the musical, has since departed.  He took out a second mortgage to keep the production going, just to see if it would have legs.  With proper funding, public relations and word of mouth, there would be so much more behind all these musicals.  As Mr. Foley stated, AIMS has 15,000 members.

This is a musical form bringing in so many new faces and putting new bums on seats.  It is showing those families and kids, the theatregoers, what theatre can be.  It totally celebrates British artists.  The music is so British and the full creative team is British.  Why can we not do something similar here with our artists?  I believe this is what RT&Eacute; is doing so well in this new venture.  It is an Irish story told by Irish artists and with an Irish creative team.  It is about how we can see that in our producing houses.  As I said to Ms Kelleher as we came in the door, while having a separate stand-alone chat about musical theatre as a separate entity is needed at the moment, we should be working towards the day when musical theatre is part of theatre.  When I am at home I am called a musical theatre director but in the UK I am a theatre director.  It is the same thing.

Whereas box office sales are really buoyant and show that musical theatre has probably had one of the best - if not the best - box office sales in the country, as Mr. Campbell said, it requires funding to put on a professional set-up.  If competitors are coming in with the bells and whistles, one cannot then do a semi-professional version because it is deemed amateur in the public eye.  If this is to be done professionally, it needs to be funded accordingly.  Currently, there are no appropriate application boxes to tick in order to do that.

That is the very essence of this committee and we are honoured to have them.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by Mr. Roche's comment about writing music and then asking what he should do next to put all of the other components together.<\/p><p>His comment brought back to me an experience from this summer, when Senator Malcolm Byrne and I visited Ashford Studio in Wicklow, where we met the legendary producer Morgan O'Sullivan on the set of &quot;Vikings&quot;.  Malcolm and I had not been recruited to be part of the show; we were deemed too good-looking, our skin was too soft and our features were too nice to be part of a rugged set like that, but we had the ruthless streak, all right.<br\/><br\/>Mr. O'Sullivan made a point about pathways, and this is what I want to focus on with our guests.  He said the country was devoid of pathways for new writers.  Even though we are renowned as a literary country, the lack of pathways to get young people writing for shows that are produced here was striking to us.  His ask was similar to that of our guests and related to creating pathways to get that basic talent, such as that which we are lucky enough to see Mr. Donnelly have on screen, to the end point.  We need to be able to bring the statements of our guests to the relevant people to try to create those pathways and make them happen.  As Mr. Donnelly mentioned, he decided to give it a go and he was lucky to make it, but he started in St. Mary's Musical Society in my hometown, Navan.  New talent was presented at the AIMS awards this summer in Killarney to Katie Fitzsimons, who won the award for best actress in a supporting role in a production by St Mary's Musical Society of <i>The Wizard of Oz<\/i>.  We can see the young talent is there, but it is about having the pathways to ensure their success.<br\/><br\/>We talked earlier about the barriers to domestic production and Ms Kelleher referred in her statement to the costs associated with that.  We may have a critical mass of young people, but do we have a critical mass of audiences to balance out that production costs Mr.  Campbell spoke about, or is it a case of needing massive Government subvention to make that a reality?  This applies equally to the music societies.  St. Mary's Musical Society in Navan has been on the go since the 1960s.  Its costs for putting on shows, and I am sure the costs of all our guests' societies throughout the country, have risen exponentially.  From an amateur point of view, they too might comment on facing those costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#E01200","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":943,"content":"<p>That is an interesting question.  I can answer from the academy's perspective.  I am going to use the example we are more comfortable with in the academy, namely, opera.  Our opera training programme at bachelor level is exceptionally good.  You would have to be stone mad to leave the country at undergraduate level to study opera; it is that good.  Our singers win international competitions and get roles in major opera houses.<\/p> <p>  In order to do that, ten years ago, we committed a serious amount of money for education.  I was struck by the comments of the gentleman from AIMS because our investment equated to the exact same sum.  In our annual opera production - we are the only college in Ireland to offer an annual fully staged opera production - there is no change out of &euro;60,000.  For a small college, that is a lot to find.  It is even more expensive for musical theatre because there are additional aspects such as dance, movement and amplification, so that would probably cost more.<\/p> <p>  What has made our opera programmes so successful is that real-life experience our singers have with professional directors and crews.  They go out into postgraduate study or into the world ahead of the game.  Musical theatre education in Ireland has not had committed Government support.  There is the excellent work that Ms Masterson has been doing, and there is the Munster Technological University and Dundalk Institute of Technology, but this is an expensive education art form, so it needs ring-fenced additional support.  The reward is that so many young people want to study there, so there is no shortage of supply.  Moreover, as Ms Masterson said, musical theatre is probably the most popular art form in the world, aside from perhaps death metal, which probably has an unexpected calling.<\/p> <p>  There is the interest, the critical mass and the societal benefits to it; it just requires investment, but not on the scale of a national health service.  For educational purposes, it is expensive to mount these productions, but for performers, musical directors, writers and everyone who is in training, that is the coalface where people really learn and that is where the funds are lacking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Kelleher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":944,"content":"<p>The current structure for the art forms that are acknowledged in regard to funding, namely, opera, dance and theatre, would be a suitable template to consider.

If I decided to stage a show tomorrow and I needed &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 to do it, I would not have a hope of doing it.  On the other hand, if we are staging a show next year, as I might do with my musical society, Avonmore, businesses in the community will come on board and we might get &euro;100 from one shop and &euro;500 from another.  If we are lucky and we get on to the county council, we might get a grant of &euro;500 or &euro;250, depending on how many sporting or musical groups are in the pot when the money is being divvied out.  As other guests noted, we are looking for financial investment in order that we can put in the groundwork or the basis on which we can build this.<br\/><br\/>To pay tribute to two of the other guests. I had the privilege of seeing Mr. Donnelly in Waterford when we won the award for best newcomer at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.  It is amazing that someone I saw starting there years ago has gone on to star in the West End.  Similarly, I saw Mr. Campbell directing shows at Trinity College Dublin when he was a student and also in Donegal, and now he is directing shows in the West End and another here in Dublin, namely, <i>Toy Show: The Musical<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We are blessed to have people of this stature and talent in the country.  With no disrespect to Mr. Campbell and Mr. Donnelly, we have so much talent in this country that they will not all get a chance to shine, and they will travel to the UK to make a career in this business.  If they are lucky and they get in that door, that is great, but if they do not, they will end up coming back home here, where they have so much to give in this world of musical theatre.<br\/><br\/>If we can use the likes of Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Campbell to help establish, as Ms Masterson and others outlined, a national musical theatre in this country, that would be great.  People travelled from Ireland to the West End to see <i>The Commitments<\/i>when Mr. Donnelly was cast in the lead role, with an all-Irish cast.  If that show had been staged in Dublin, everyone would have gone to see it because we support our own.  I have no doubt that when Mr. Donnelly came here to star in <i>The Phantom of the Opera<\/i>, the sales went through the roof, not because that particular musical was coming but because Killian Donnelly was coming home to Ireland to play the lead in <i>The Phantom of the Opera<\/i>, and that is amazing.  Likewise, it is great that Mr. Campbell is coming home to direct shows in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>That is where they should be performing, in Ireland and for us and the people who are here.  People will come.  Every show in the Bord G&aacute;is Energy Theatre or elsewhere in Dublin is packed out because musical theatre is the biggest entertainment form.  It is our hobby, but it is a profession for some of the other guests and we need to do all we can to keep that going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022092800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Donnelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664319600,"counter":946,"content":"<p>A thought came to me as we were talking earlier.  I had my first audition for <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables<\/i>in 2007.  I went onto the stage of the Queen's Theatre and in the audience were about 11 creatives, one of whom was Sir Cameron Mackintosh.  I sang a song and he asked me where I was from.  When I replied &quot;Ireland&quot;, he said the Irish and the Welsh belonged in musical theatre.  I plucked up the courage and asked him why he thought that, and he said that judging by the quality of the untrained voices, there was something in the water.<\/p><p>Having said that, in 2018, at the Bord G&aacute;is theatre, I performed <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables<\/i>as Jean Valjean.  I met young Irish people at the stage door who said they would love to do this.  I asked them why they did not and said that there were colleges.  They told me that they cannot afford London.<br\/><br\/>On the creation of work, I did three workshops before <i>The Commitments<\/i>went to rehearsals.  In the previous three years that led up to rehearsals, I got two weeks' work, with a script of <i>The Commitments<\/i>and singing songs where I would try new ideas.  Someone like Billy Roche would benefit from a workshop of his new show being funded.  That was being paid for by a British producer, who now owns the rights to <i>The Commitments<\/i>.  Roddy Doyle was in the room with us but he worked with all of us.

We could specifically ask the council to do that and to outline its strategy to promote and develop musical theatre in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Foley and Mr. Donnelly mentioned the new and exciting subject at second level relating to film, drama and theatre studies.  We should write to the Minister for Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to seek to have musical theatre incorporated as part of that subject.

The restricted funding streams for the sector have been highlighted here.  I am dealing with Castlebar Musical and Dramatic Society.  I tabled a few parliamentary questions about this issue.  Thankfully, Ms Masterson addressed them in her opening statement.  Bridging that gap to put on these high-quality shows and allowing both the cast and staging crew to have insurance cover for materials cannot all be absorbed by ticket sales and the generosity of local businesses.  It needs State support.<\/p> <p>  I have another question that Mr. Donnelly might answer about the feasibility of establishing cross-jurisdiction partnerships with the West End and the relevant theatres here in Ireland.
