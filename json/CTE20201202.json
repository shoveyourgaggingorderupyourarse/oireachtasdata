We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the Committee.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Neasa Hourigan.<\/p> <p>  Before we move on to the other items of business I want to make a statement.  I want to address the issue surrounding the tweet that I published over the weekend marking the 100th anniversary of the Kilmichael ambush in County Cork.  I am very conscious, as the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, that the controversy has placed all the members in a difficult and totally unnecessary situation, particularly when this committee has such important work to carry out.  What I was attempting to do was to highlight that following the disastrous decision to partition the country almost 100 years ago, in the wake of events such as Kilmichael we still had conflict that went on for a long time during which a lot of suffering took place.  I deleted the tweet and apologised for posting it.<\/p> <p>  As we work to advance reconciliation on our island, we need to be able to talk about the past in a way that is honest to all of us and our beliefs but that does not deepen division or cause hurt.  As an Irish republican and someone who is in a position of political leadership, I have to be more aware of my responsibility to ensure that I do not do anything that is disrespectful to others.  Since the mid-1980s, when A Scenario for Peace was published, right through the Hume-Adams dialogue, and, finally, to the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, I have actively supported initiatives to bring about peace on the island.  On Sunday, I apologised for any offence that I caused due to the insensitive nature of the tweet and I want to repeat that apology to the members today.  I also want to apologise to all my colleagues for the position in which I put them.  My tweet fell below not just the standard we expect of each other but the standard I expect of myself as a Member of the D&aacute;il and for that I am genuinely sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#A00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for making that statement.  I welcome the decision by the Ceann Comhairle to respond to the letter from Arlene Foster.  It was a very strong statement to the effect that nothing we do in here should in any way contribute to undermining the democratic process.  I believe the tweet was offensive at a time when, more than ever, we all need to work together with the UK leaving the European Union.  We all have a harder task in respect of working together with the Six Counties, which will be outside the EU, and we must make sure that nothing is done to undermine that process whereby the entire issue is now changed.<\/p> <p>  This committee is one of the most important committees in this House.  We are here to hold Departments and State authorities to account.  Likewise, it is here to hold every one of us to account, including Deputy Stanley, as Chairman.  It is disappointing that this tweet was sent out.  The Chairman's party leader said his was a one-off tweet but a number of tweets have been sent over the past number of months which were subsequently withdrawn.  There is a lot of speculation that some of these tweets are being deliberately and carefully drafted.  That is not the way to deal with issues and create division, and I certainly believe the tweet has created division.  <\/p> <p>  It is extremely important now that the Chairman makes a full statement on this matter in the D&aacute;il to re-establish his credibility as Chairman and the credibility of this committee.  Many people died over the 30 years of conflict.  The day the Chairman mentioned, the Narrow Water attack, was the same day two people aged 14 and 15 died in another tragedy at a different location.  It is extremely important that we do not bring back the divisions that existed at that time or add to them in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#A00300","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Does anybody else want to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Chairman took down the tweet, apologised and has made a statement here.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and a Member of the D&aacute;il, the tweet got much more attention beyond Twitter in the broadcast and the mainstream media.  That is not terribly surprising but it does have an external impact also beyond this jurisdiction.  I sat on the decade of centenaries committee which dealt with the pre-1916 period and there were members of the Chairman's party on it who played a very constructive role.  The one thing we all understood was how difficult any kind of marking of the War of Independence and the Civil War would be and the need to be very respectful in any of that.  I would want an assurance that this is a one-off mistake.  I would like to hear that from the Chairman.  The Committee of Public Accounts does not have a role in respect of this issue.  Any role in respect of it is within his party in terms of how media and social media are handled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#A00500","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Last week, John Finucane, MP, came in to seek our support for his family's quest for an inquiry into the horrific murder of his father.<\/p><p>In the course of that meeting and of the debate on the Seanad motion which preceded it, the Houses of the Oireachtas recognised and recounted the terrible details of the violence visited upon the Finucane family.  The Chairman of joint committee, Deputy O'Dowd, offered his full support and noted that Mr. Finucane's family was not the only one to suffer and that all the victims of violence need to be respected.  The party of our Chairman has stated repeatedly that there is not a hierarchy of victims.  We have to acknowledge that his tweet was about a very violent incident within recent memory, involving the death of very young men and in a very strategic and deliberate way.  We heard at another committee last week about the human impact of violence.  There is a human impact to this violence also that is very significant and has been well recounted.  The Chairman's tweet hurts the survivors who are alive today and whose family members - teenage boys and young men, some of them fathers - are still missing this Christmas.<\/p><p> What I want to know is what was behind the sentiment the Chairman expressed and what it says about what we are trying to do in terms of reconciliation for the future and about mutual respect.  The tweet seems to have no regard for the personal impact on the people who are left behind, in the way his party quite rightly called for in recognition of the Finucane family last week.  It is what is behind that sentiment that concerns me.  I am also interested in what prompted the Chairman to remove it and what was his thought process in that regard?  It is hard to see because a person must have that sentiment within himself or herself in the first place in order to express it.  Did somebody call the Chairman and tell him to delete it?  Did he receive an instruction?<\/p><p> I do not think that anything Sinn F&eacute;in does is by accident.  It is a highly strategic operation that has been well controlled, well managed and well planned in all its steps, before 1998 and since.  This is the first time Sinn F&eacute;in has held such a senior position in this Parliament.  Deputy Stanley is Chair of this committee, which, historically, is the most important of all the parliamentary committees and which is always chaired by an established parliamentarian of significance and of significant experience.  It is because of the significance of his office, that the reaction we have seen has been forthcoming.  My view is that he needs to go further than making an apology to this committee.  What he has said represents an attempt to alleviate the discord within the committee, but the real offence is to the Irish people and to their representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I think the Chairman should go to the D&aacute;il and apologise or make a personal statement there.  His party needs to make a statement of a similar nature that genuinely separates this repeating of violence and the glory of violence every couple of weeks.  The sequence is that it happens every couple of weeks and then there is an apology and we move on.  Meanwhile, it becomes more normalised just as we move towards a period of commemorations.<\/p><p> As parliamentarians, we must ensure that we take steps to protect the moderate nature of our politics.  Every party here has done things in stepping towards the centre in defence of the State that might have been politically uncomfortable for it.  I do not want to lose that centre ground to a polarised sort of politics like we have on other parts of this island.  I urge the Chairman and his party to take those steps towards moderation and to talk about separation from violence and to reject that.  I think he can play a hugely significant role in that regard.  His office is of such significance that it is hard to let the matter pass without noting it in this way.  I really urge him to give the matter further reflection before we get on with our business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#A00600","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for making that statement.  I know it is never easy for a public representative, especially somebody who holds the Chair of an important committee such as this, to sit in front of his or her colleagues and tell them that he or she made a mistake and to outline that he or she is genuinely sorry for that mistake.  I believe the Chairman.  I think anybody who knows him, regardless of their political affiliations, will believe him.  Anybody who knows him will know that the tweet was a clumsy attempt at something.  I think he has accepted that and that it was not the place to have, as other members of the committee have alluded to, an important debate in which we all need to participate.<\/p> <p>  Anybody who knows Brian Stanley will acknowledge that, first and foremost, he is a good man.  He is a fair man.  He is certainly a very fair and effective Chair of this committee.  In the short number of months since the committee has been in existence, anybody looking on, recognising the challenges that it has faced trying to deal with two-hour sessions and what are in some instances very elaborate and detailed issues and sets of accounts, knows that the Chairman has conducted himself in a very fair and effective manner that has allowed this committee to deliver, insofar as it can, under those restrictive measures.<\/p> <p>  These are going to be a very important number of years, not only in the context of the ongoing decade of centenaries, but also as we move to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  That means we all need to be part of mature reflection, but also mature discussion and debate and a recognition that there is not a shared narrative in terms of the causes of conflict in the first instance but also the outworking of those conflicts.  The only thing we all agree on is that in whatever roles we have, we must all do everything within our power to ensure that never again does this island experience the conflicts that have been a hallmark of Irish history.  We are moving to a point in terms of the Good Friday generation where some Members of this House have no recollection of the conflict itself.  This means that those of us who have some recollection and those who have a very clear recollection of the conflict have a very important responsibility to ensure that there is no glory in conflict.  Unfortunately, many people suffered.  As has already been mentioned, lots of people tragically lost their lives.  The role that we all now need to play is to ensure that the suffering and loss of life in those circumstances never happens again.<\/p> <p>  As for this committee, we have important work to do.  I, for one, accept the Chairman's apology.  I believe that it is heartfelt.  I hope that in our own individual ways we can play a role to ensure that we can all give commitments that we will be incredibly careful in terms of our public utterances on these issues in the first instance, but that we can play constructive roles in the ongoing job of building peace in our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#B00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carthy very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#B00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I accept the Chairman's apology and his statement.

We are here on behalf of the Oireachtas to scrutinise public bodies and other bodies.  That said, I accept his apology.  I do not think this is the place to scrutinise the tweet.  That is for the D&aacute;il Chamber and it is for the Chairman and his party to reflect on whether they want to deal with the matter in that forum.<\/p> <p>  I would not classify the tweet as clumsy.  I do not say the Chairman did so.  I hope that when he says he apologises for the tweet, it will not happen again.

Apart from distracting from the work of this committee, my view is that the apology should be made to those impacted by the tweet, rather to us.  I was not going to comment on the issue but in the Chairman's explanation and in Deputy Carthy's contribution, whether it was a clumsy tweet or a strategic approach, as another member mentioned, a definite attempt was made to try to conflate actions which the army of the Republic of Ireland took in 1920 and the actions that an organisation of the same name took at Narrow Water.  That is not new.  It is a political difference the Chairman's party has with many others in the D&aacute;il.  It is also an attempt to suggest that for someone to be in favour of a united Ireland, it is enough to be anti-British.  We know we need to do far more than that to create a shared island.<\/p> <p>  While I and many other members of the committee were quite reasonable when we were getting media requests yesterday, the irony is not lost on me that if any of us had been in the Chairman's position, we would probably be the subject of a pile-on.  I do not draw my political tactics from that style of politics when I am in the wrong and I do not believe I should do it when other people are in the wrong.  I object to the Twitter pile-on today in respect of the Ceann Comhairle.  It was an attempt to open up a second line of defence and it was deplorable, especially when so many members of this committee have been so reasonable on this issue.  Deputy Devlin put it well when he said that this is a political difference between the Chairman's party and others here.  The Chairman has as much of a mandate as any other Deputy in this House.  The matter is one between Sinn F&eacute;in and the Irish people, not the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#C00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his apology, which I accept.  Like Deputy Verona Murphy, I do not condone the content of the tweet, which was insensitive and inappropriate.  It caused hurt to victims and descendants of victims and people who have a particular perspective.  I respect and fully understand that.  The Committee of Public Accounts is not the place for what some people are seeking, however.  The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement should by all means invite the Chairman before it to explore this matter.  If the Ceann Comhairle wants to pursue this issue, that is what the Committee on Procedure is for; it is not our role.<\/p> <p>  Like Deputy Verona Murphy, I believe that, as a nation, we have become a colosseum where we are far too anxious to set up a guillotine every time there is a misdemeanour.  I have previously stated outside this room that an appropriate body, such as the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, should develop a book of quantum of sorts, with a list of appropriate sanctions for appropriate levels of misdemeanour, from lesser offences right up to more serious ones.  The outcome of the approach we are taking now is the same every time there is an indiscretion or a misdemeanour, however serious or minor.  It is to seek someone's head.  We saw that recently with the T&aacute;naiste's leak.  Some approached that issue in an appropriate way, but others in a different way.  <\/p> <p>  I am not for one second condoning the content of the tweet.  It was insensitive.  It is a matter, however, for the committee on the Good Friday Agreement, and certainly not for us.  A great deal of dirty laundry will need to be washed out publicly in the years ahead, as the healing and reconciliation process continues.  That of course includes the Finucane family and a public inquiry in that regard, where we have done our end of the bargain with the Smithwick tribunal, as agreed at Weston Park.  That has not been matched by the British, who have, unfortunately, brought their judicial system into disrepute by their actions.  <\/p> <p>  I am old enough to remember the Troubles being a nightly blight on the news, in respect of the loss of life on both sides.  We all regret that.  Given the years we are in, I wonder, when we look back, why we manage to romanticise and glorify atrocities of 100 years ago and then look at others in a different light.  I abhor all violence.  I mourn the victims of all violence, no matter on what side or in what era.<\/p> <p>  I would prefer if this committee stuck to its business.  We have a huge body of work to get through.  I accept the Chairman's apology.  If the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement wishes to pursue a particular line, it can do that.  If the D&aacute;il wants to pursue a particular line, the Business Committee and the Committee on Procedure are there for that purpose.  We do not have the competence, and I certainly do not have the will, to pursue this matter any further here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#C00300","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his statement.

There were a number of things that stood out.  I will refer to one.  The prefabs in the longest standing rental agreement have stood since 2000.  There is a building going up now but one would have to ask about value for money in terms of the length of time that took and it is important that we note that.  There may well be others that are not as long but that could be nearly as long.<\/p><p>It would be quite useful to get a few more examples, perhaps five, six or even ten examples of the length of time.  There is the cost of renting and the issue of substandard accommodation as well.  I ask that this be done.<\/p><p> With regard to the payroll system, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; states on page 3 that there are approximately 9,000 casual employees and that there is a new standard of governance and approval process for the sourcing of goods and services.  An interim payroll upgrade is under way and it is due to be completed in the latter part of 2021.  He said the implementation of a new payroll system could take up to three or four years, which is a surprisingly long lead-in time for something like this.  It is stated there is a very complex system with four different streams on the payroll, with primary, post-primary, non-teaching staff and retired people but there are 9,000 casual employees.  I received information in reply to a parliamentary question that under the home tuition scheme, home tutors have always been engaged by parents or guardians of a child who receives home tuition.  Tutors do not have a contractual relationship with the Department.  Are they among the 9,000?  What is the proportion of these 9,000 casual employees?  I acknowledge that some of them are probably substitute teachers.  A little more examination needs to happen so we can get an understanding of it.<\/p><p> The average compensation payment does not always compute in the one year.  It is not entirely satisfactory that we are unable to see it all and it may well be that we have to look back historically.  Where there are compensation payments, we have to learn whether there are things that can be avoided in the future.  It is very important that we see the cost of something and the value of doing some work.  That is the reason I am particularly picking up on this.<\/p><p> There is an important paragraph on page 6 on the school transport system and the fact that some moneys were paid back to the Exchequer.  It is an important paragraph with regard to some issues we have previously looked at.  It would be quite useful to ask about the final sentence on page 7 and whether it is intended to pursue a Garda investigation.  Perhaps we can ask for an update in a few months just to keep an eye on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#G02300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606926600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>The first issue I want to raise arising from the correspondence also relates to temporary accommodation prefabs.  I am always wary when temporary solutions are in place for a long period because we end up creating vested interests and people who have an interest in a bad practice continuing for longer.  The three largest suppliers of rental accommodation in 2019 were three companies that provide Portakabins and prefabs.  Can we ask the Department to clarify the number of students being educated in such structures?<\/p> <p>  The school Deputy Murphy spoke about has made use of temporary accommodation for 20 years.  We know from the work of previous Committees of Public Accounts that this is not a cheap option.  Over time, the funds expended on temporary accommodation in a single school would buy a small house in Dalkey, just to give Deputy Devlin's constituency a mention.  We are speaking about substantial money.  It would be useful if the committee could ask of the Department, in tabular format, all of the schools using temporary structures, the duration they have been used and the cost associated with them to date.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  I fully endorse Deputy Murphy's point on legal claims.  It requires much more scrutiny.  It is not just the Department of Education but it is a good place to start.  As she said, it is very opaque to find out exactly how much in any given year was spent on settling legal claims.  It is very hard to find information, particularly where claims were settled or if there was a non-disclosure element to the deal.  The State could have been forfeiting substantial sums due to negligence, for example.  We hear anecdotes public servants making complaints about another public servant and the Department settles.  The public servant at the heart of it could be promoted in an external competition and nobody realises that person is the reason the State is out substantial funds.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General in a position to give us an analysis on the legal costs associated with the Department over a period of time as opposed to just one year?  As the correspondence correctly states, a claim might be made in 2020 but it might not be settled until 2023.  Usually, when a Department comes before us in a given year, its representative states a claim that was settled last year relates to something from five years ago and that the problems have been addressed.  If we had an overarching analysis, it would be useful for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020120200002#H00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606926600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I will respond on that specific point.

There should be better information available and it should be available on a Department-by-Department basis.  The State Claims Agency handles all of these on behalf of Departments.

In the course of the Secretary General's contribution, he mentioned there may be the possibility of using an existing or planned upgrade to allow a system to be implemented.  My question as a new member of the committee is how we track this.  It was a formal issue raised with the Secretary General.  He has written to us to outline the figures but has not given us a commitment or responded in any way as to how he would address the costs, which I call \"wasteful\".

In Maynooth, there is a schools bundle 5 project to build two 1,000 pupil schools right beside each other.  These schools were due to be occupied last September but they still have not been completed so there is a cost in the interim.  It may not be the cost of building the schools but there are costs for additional accommodation.  There are costs that are not counted as costs by virtue of the fact that the project has not been completed.  Therefore, it is not quite accurate to say that the entire cost is borne.

A sum of &euro;20 million to a company that was operating abroad, which I am sure is a very reputable company, and good luck to it, certainly was not where we were coming from.

According to the correspondence, only 7% of what was loaned to BIFSL, essentially by the Irish taxpayer, was deployed into the Irish SME market.  That is very substantial and I agree with the proposal that has been made.  However, I think it would also be prudent for the committee to ask the Department of Finance for its response in respect of all of this.  At the end of the day we are dealing with Irish taxpayers' money, so it would be appropriate to ask the Department of Finance for comment on this matter.

This year, 2020, is the first year going forward from that review, so the corporation is making some changes in its mode of operation and there has been some paying down of the borrowing, which I believe was borrowing from Germany, so some of that has been repaid.  It is involved not just in the first line of activity, which is lending to SMEs who were having difficulty in accessing the market, but also in providing funding in the context of Brexit.

I can get the Deputy a copy of it.  It explains the structure.  They are very complicated accounts in the way they operate.

Obviously, it is not operating on anything like the scale it did a number of years back.

If they are Irish, they will have to produce their PPS number, or the equivalent across the EU.  Apart from that, a person will have to produce a passport.  The Deputy has indicated that a company may sometimes have an investment in the investment limited partnership or in a fund under that partnership.  Her question was on establishing the identity of the shareholders behind the company.  There are two tests.  If one owns over 25%, one is identified as a person involved, but if one owns less than 25% but has a controlling interest in the company, perhaps through other people, one is also deemed a person whose identity must be disclosed.  The legislative phrasing is in line with the anti-money laundering legislation that is already in place.<\/p> <p>  If a person has a 25% shareholding, the owners of the remaining 75% control the company.  A person with only 15% or 20% does not usually have a controlling interest but someone with a shareholding of less than 25% might have a controlling interest if he or she is working in league with other shareholders who also have shareholdings of less than 25%.  However, only one person &ndash; we are talking about a person, not a company &ndash; can be the beneficial owner.<\/p> <p>  The important point is that it is up to the general partner in the investment limited partnership to satisfy himself or herself that he or she has all the documentation to get Central Bank approval.  If that person does not do his or her job properly, he will lose the benefit of limited partnership and all the limited liability.  He or she would then be open personally and have no protection under the legislation.  The onus is really on the general partner to satisfy himself or herself regarding everybody who invests in the fund.  If the general partner does not do his or her job, he or she will be liable to direct action by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020120200002#A00900","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1606867200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>That is the safeguard.

In other words, could two or three venture capital companies be involved under separate headings so that, to the casual observer, each could be seen as an individual although they were all brought together by the same controlling company?

It is not the case that a company must only declare one beneficial owner.  Once any investment company owns more than 25% of shares or has a controlling interest in the fund, each and every one of its shareholders must be declared.  What is also important about this legislation is that the beneficial owners - and there may be multiple beneficial owners - have to produce their PPS numbers.  If they do not have one, they must produce their passport.  No shell company can be an investor without the ultimate beneficial owner's identity being listed on the Central Bank's register of beneficial owners.  If a person is a shareholder, his or her passport must be produced before the company and the fund can get the approval of the Central Bank.  We will have the details of these individuals regardless of where they are in the world.

On that issue, the Central Bank is the regulator of these funds.  It is seen internationally as a very strong regulator.  The Deputy points to the history in this area.  There has been a strong response to that history with regard to improvements in how the Central Bank deals with this area and the level of supervision it provides.<\/p><p>The usual complaint I get is that it is overly bureaucratic, whether in respect of banks or credit unions or funds such as those addressed by the Bill.  I do not accept that complaint because it is an asset for Ireland that we can state internationally that we have good, strong regulation.  If a business comes to Ireland, it will have the benefit of one of the best regulators in Europe.  We are particularly strong in terms of regulation.<\/p><p> On the issue of investors, this is a is very important point.  The essence of the Bill relates to investment limited partnerships.  As is the case when investing in any shares, if a company or a person invests &euro;100,000, they can lose their money if the product does not work or the company does not succeed but, no matter what happens, their losses are always limited to what they invest.  When investing in a financial product, one takes one's chances.  However, there is absolute regulation  The person who manages the fund has no limited liability and, as such, is fully on the hook personally if they do not do their job properly.  If a company or a fund happens to run into a problem, the individual investor cannot be called on to contribute any more than he or she contributed on day one because his or her liability is limited to his or her original investment.  All one can lose is the money one puts in, in the same way that in every walk of life and in every investment one makes there is no possibility of having to contribute further.  Even if there is a loss, the investor's liability is completely limited to the original investment.  There cannot be any greater loss.  As I stated, we have strong regulation.<\/p><p> I thank members for their contributions.  It is good that there is broad support for this essential Bill which will help to modernise investment limited partnerships offering in Ireland and will make changes to the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicle Act 2015.  The amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 will help to ensure that the Central Bank can operate as the beneficial owner register which we already discussed.  I believe the changes will help to further support Ireland's offering as a top-tier global location choice for financial services.  As I mentioned at the outset, the legislation is consistent with the Ireland for finance strategy and is timed well to take advantage of the capital markets union agenda and to promote the establishment of private equity and venture capital vehicle funds in Ireland.  Every new product like this on the market will lead to additional jobs in Ireland.  People will work in this sector that was not available for Ireland before this legislation.  Not only will it create additional investment, it will also create additional employment and additional taxation for the State.

They are arrogant beyond belief and the language they use in confronting people about the issues of the loans and so on is just horrific.<\/p> <p>  The last thing I will say about the Central Bank, with which we are arranging a meeting, is that if it had regulated properly at the time that Jonathan Sugarman made his complaint regarding a bank, we might not have ended up in the deep trouble we were in during the ensuing financial collapse. <\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State and his officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020120200002#C00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1606867200,"counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020120200002#C00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1606867200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>In according with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <p>  The Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has considered its consideration of the Investment Limited Partnerships (Amendment) Bill 2020 and has made no amendments thereto.

I apologise to colleagues for not being available earlier today, as the committee had requested.  I was attending a meeting of EU health Ministers, an annual meeting.  It was quite long, but it included matters such as a briefing on Covie-19 vaccines so, regrettably, I could not make it to a meeting this morning.  I thank the committee for accommodating this time today.<\/p><p>The additional funding I am seeking for 2020 is &euro;514.5 million.  In June, the Oireachtas approved an additional &euro;2 billion to meet the costs of the health service&rsquo;s response to Covid-19, bringing the new adjusted total for the health Vote to &euro;19.9 billion.  The Supplementary Estimates request for Vote 38 relates primarily to the costs associated with Government decisions on Covid made subsequent to the Revised Estimates in June.  This includes additional funding for measures, including personal protective equipment, PPE, testing and tracing, &euro;200 million for this part of the winter plan, escalation of no-deal Brexit measures, one-off funding to support disability services, one-off funding to support palliative care providers and the costs associated with the Covid-19 vaccination programme.<\/p><p>In June, I said that the additional approved funding of &euro;2 billion would not represent the totality of the cost of Covid-19 for this year and that further funding would be required.  This is that request.  The health Vote has required Supplementary Estimates each year for the past number of years, and the HSE worked very hard last year to bring down the additional funding requirements.  I am committed to working with the HSE and the Department to continue to strengthen the financial management.<\/p><p>On a side note, I draw members&rsquo; attention to the recently published Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report, &ldquo;How does Irish Healthcare Expenditure compare internationally?&rdquo;.  I am sure colleagues have seen it.  It compares healthcare expenditure in Ireland to that of other OECD countries.  It is the first report of its type that does this accurately.  It is something I have sought previously, as have health committees in the past.  There has been an ongoing perception that Ireland spends more than other countries on healthcare.  The ESRI report shows that when measured <i>per capita<\/i>and on a like-for-like basis Ireland&rsquo;s total expenditure on healthcare ranks ninth among the EU 15 and it drops to tenth when one considers just the public aspects of healthcare expenditure.  It is a topic I would like to engage on with the committee on another day, if the committee is interested.  Between us, we could re-frame the conversation about healthcare expenditure in Ireland with a view from me and many of my colleagues that if we are not as high up the tables, there is room for us to continue pushing.<\/p><p>The health service has responded in an unprecedented fashion to Covid-19 and has incurred substantial additional costs in doing so.  The single most significant medium-term cost is PPE.  Included in June&rsquo;s Revised Estimates for the Covid-19 allocation of &euro;1.997 billion was &euro;253 million for PPE.  The HSE has forecast PPE expenditure of &euro;920 million to the end of this year, which includes planned stock levels at year end of approximately 12-years supply in line with clinical management guidelines.  This leaves a supplementary request of &euro;667 million compared to the original allocation.<\/p><p>The June Revised Estimates approved &euro;208 million for testing and contact tracing.  This initial allocation was to fund testing and contact tracing until 31 August.  Included in the Supplementary Estimates today is a request for &euro;68 million, which is required to fund testing and contact tracing to the end of the year.  Up to the end of November, almost 2 million tests had been carried out.<\/p><p>A significant element of the request relates to the HSE winter plan.  The Government committed &euro;600 million in total to deal with winter pressures and the additional pressures presented by the pandemic.  This includes &euro;600 million for 2020, which is in today&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimates, and &euro;400 million for 2021, which essentially is January, February, March and April.  The winter plan is increasing the capacity of the health service and ensuring continuity of service by providing additional commute and community resources, staff and beds, as well as funding initiatives including the flu vaccination programme and many other items.  Budget 2021 funds the permanent retention of many of these measures, which is very exciting.<\/p><p>Taken with the June Revised Estimates, the Supplementary Estimates today bring the total net cost of Covid-19 supports provided to the health service to over &euro;2.5 billion and total health expenditure in 2020 to just over &euro;20.4 billion.  While the financial impact is very significant, the value of this investment in protecting our citizens in the face of the global pandemic is unquantifiable and, I would argue, priceless.  I seek the select committee&rsquo;s approval of the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;514.5 million for Vote 38.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2020120200002#A00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1606867200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I will start with subhead J1, regarding the vaccine and procurement at a European Union level.

I raise these questions in the context of subhead J2 and the &euro;200 million that was allocated to fund the winter plan.  I had this conversation with the head of the HSE recently.  Outpatient wait times are now out of control, if we are to be honest.  At the end of October 2015, there 396,000 people waiting to see a consultant.  At the end of October this year, that figure was 612,000.  More worryingly, the number of patients waiting 18 months or longer has gone from 13,353 to 153,000.  Much of this predates Covid.  Obviously, Covid has complicated the problem and added to it but the vast majority of those increases occurred in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.  I will not go through all the increases but they have been incremental every year.  In the context of the additional money the Minister says has been spent on nurses, doctors and beds, does the HSE have a plan?  Does it have a target to reduce outpatient and inpatient wait times?

The waiting times and the number of children who have been waiting more than 12 months for scoliosis are truly shocking, despite a commitment by the previous Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>  If we do not hire the specialists, consultants and all the support staff, we will not reduce those waiting times.

If the staff needed are not recruited, we will not get there.<\/p> <p>  I have raised Be on Call for Ireland with the Minister several times.  I got the most recent figures from the HSE today.  A total of 1,470 people who came home or who applied through Be on Call for Ireland are still job ready.  Half of them are in a pool and still need to go through the final interview process.  The other half have completed all of that and are ready to be hired and have not been hired.  Why is that the case?  I cannot explain how 1,470 people who want to work in our health service despite all the promises and commitments the Minister has made.  In the budget the Government promised to hire 15,000 or 16,000 additional staff and yet these people are ready to be hired.  What is the problem?  I ask the Minister to explain that.  I ask him to deal with the issue of the consultant contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2020120200002#C01200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1606867200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I do not know of the case of Elin who is awaiting an MRI scan.  When I was appointed one of the first places I went was to Crumlin where I met the scoliosis team.  This covers the situation for both Sophie and Elin.  The hospital at Crumlin needs another MRI machine and the staff to operate it.  The waiting list at Crumlin for urgent MRI scans under general anaesthetic for children is four years.  For non-urgent scans I believe it is seven years.  That basically means we have no such service.  I am working to put in place as quickly as I can temporary measures to ensure we can carry out paediatric MRI scans under general anaesthetic, which is a rather specialised thing.  I have spoken to the team in Crumlin about exactly what is needed because nobody could stand over the present situation.  It is just not fair.  We are failing these children and failing their parents.  It is just wrong.<\/p> <p>  Children with scoliosis are waiting for far too long.

The question was less around what we could do with this much money, it was more how far we think we could go for the winter and through next year.  For example, the question on critical care beds was not how many of them we could have for this much money, it was what is the total number of additional beds we think we can get into the system next year and we will fund that.  The flip side of that is because we are pushing on every single lever, or certainly many of them, in terms of beds, acute beds, community beds, eHealth, new drugs and hiring, inevitably, they are all stretch targets and there may be some of them that will be hard to hit.  Even if we had more money, the view is that it would not really be possible to deliver more because there are only so many people one can hire at any one time.

If there is any silver lining within the health service from Covid, it is that a lot of Sl&aacute;intecare initiatives and thinking, in particular around innovation, community-based care and one of the most important areas to me, which is linking up the care pathway for patients and designing it all around the patient, is happening at a level it has not happened before.  For example, I was in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital the other day, with the emergency medicine team, and by following through on the Sl&aacute;intecare principles and by providing the funding in the winter plan, there was nobody on a trolley.  The people who were in the emergency department were in their own rooms.  The emergency medicine consultants said to me that they had not seen that in many years.  One of them said he had just given up on there ever being a solution.  What is interesting is that people are still coming to the emergency department.  Admissions are still at 90% of last year, and people are still being admitted to hospital.  Admissions are still at approximately 90% of the figure for last year, but the number of people waiting on trolleys is at approximately 30% of the figure for last year, and it is because of the Sl&aacute;intecare philosophy on patient flow.  One of the things we have done is put funding in the winter plan into home care, which means the delayed transfers of care happen.  Deputy Durkan was a member of the relevant committee.

It is another feature of the programme for Government.  There has been a serious beefing up of home care hours in budget 2021.  Just yesterday we had another report released, which again gives us an insight into the major strain nursing homes have been under since March.  Many families with elderly people in the care of nursing homes are saying that if the mechanisms were in place, they would much rather have those loved ones in a home environment where they could be cared for by a care professional.<\/p> <p>  I have been digging deep into all of this and there is a certain type of person who goes into working in home care in Ireland and the OECD has statistics on this.  Home carers in Ireland are 80% female and they are of a certain demographic.  There is a trend in western European countries but there are also barriers to these people entering this type of work.  Many people who have made representations to me would like to take on this type of work.  One can train quickly and successfully as a care assistant but there are barriers if one is on a low income or in taxation bands that do not make it worthwhile.<\/p> <p>  In any given community such as the rural community I come from, there could be 14 or 15 people in direct nursing home care and there could be two or three people at community level in receipt of a social welfare payment or in a low-paid job.  If procedures were to be adjusted and if there was a little bit of ingenuity between the Department of Health and the Department of Finance, a lot more people at ground level could be helped to get to the statutory home care phase an awful lot more quickly.  They tell me the barriers mostly relate to taxation bands and finance.  There needs to be an incentive to do it.  Statutory home care is a feature of the programme for Government and I would like to hear if that has been progressed since the Minister took up office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2020120200002#F01200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1606867200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>This is one of the areas that is exciting and that we can make an awful lot of progress on in the coming years.  When we launched the expert review on nursing homes, one of the leads, who is a consultant geriatrician, was comparing the percentage of people we have in nursing homes in Ireland with the percentage in Finland.  Finland is probably seen as the best example.  I cannot remember the exact figure but it is at a fraction of what we are at.  The goal is to keep people at home.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is taking a lead on this.  We have fully funded the interRAI system for next year.  We are rolling that out straightaway and a number of assessors are being hired.  They will do a full assessment of every person's needs.  Rather than saying one can have five hours or six hours, it will be a bespoke individual assessment.  The programme for Government commitment on increased hours was for 5 million hours over five years.  We have allocated funding in the health budget for next year for all 5 million of those hours next year.  That does not mean we will not do any more in the future.  We are going for this.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that it is not enough to have the systems and the money.  We have to have the carers and to do that we have to look at caring as a profession and at the kind of supports they need.  The exact matters the Deputy is talking about will be considered by myself, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the sector.  I am excited about this.  If we get this right, we can revolutionise growing older in this country and have far more people living at home for longer.

These people might respond to an advertisement online or in the local press that is seeking for care assistants and offering to help them to get trained up but people quickly discover there is a large number of barriers.  Those barriers should be broken down.  For a lot of these people it might have been a choice to be a stay-at-home parent for a number of years.  Perhaps if the rules were changed and if they were allowed to go out during school hours and provide home care within their communities for that four or five hours, be freed up in the evening and not have their income overly taxed, it would be a great incentive to get this growing at grassroots level in an organic way.

According to Kingston Mills, this has not been tested on children, which is a problem.  It has not been established that the Pfizer vaccine is effective in cutting infectiousness.  It may prevent somebody from getting the virus but it does not mean that the person is not a carrier.  To what extent are those issues being pursued at a European level?  Does the Minister expect that it is likely that approval will be given with caveats about key elements, as has happened in the UK?  I understand that there is a requirement for states to take on liability in the event that anything goes wrong.  That is potentially a blank cheque.  We do not know what is involved.  In normal circumstances, the fact that pharmaceutical companies have to carry the liability for their products is a break that is put on developing new vaccines or medications, which can be good because companies have to be cautious in developing new products to ensure that they do not do harm.

They made a few points.  We are going through the European Medicines Agency, EMA, process.  The UK has its own process.  That authorisation comes with advisory notes.  Our public health people are saying that Ireland is signed up to six people.  They are at various stages with the EMA.  It looks like a decision will be made about the Pfizer vaccine first, then the Moderna vaccine.  They are saying that different vaccines may be appropriate for different groups.  Some vaccines may work better for people who are more vulnerable to it and people of different ages.  They are looking to the EMA to provide this advice.  Our experts will look at the UK&rsquo;s advice too, but we will take our lead directly from the EMA.  As the EMA issues that advice, it may well indicate the priority groups and say that it is not looking to vaccinate children in the short term, and so on.  We will take our lead from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the public health teams.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right about liability.  The EU has waived liability, so Ireland, as with every other member state, is indemnifying the pharmaceutical companies to get access to the vaccine.  I am not concerned from a safety perspective because the EMA is the regulator and I have been assured that even though the process is quicker because of the nature of Covid, the same standards and bars have been set as for every other medicine that we take.

We have done it quite differently this year.  Last year, the winter plan cost &euro;30 million.  This year, it is &euro;600 million.  We are doing things at a completely different scale.  In fairness, what we designed with the HSE was a winter plan.  So far, it is working.  The trolley numbers are at 30% of what they were last year but presentations are still at 90%.  We are entering into the biggest pinch point, now through the end of December, but so far it is working.<\/p> <p>  We have not entirely designed it as a once-off winter plan.  We have said that there is &euro;600 million for the winter plan.  I am looking for the permission of Deputies for &euro;200 million of this for the current year.  In next year's base, there is &euro;400 million for January, February, March and April of next year.  Essentially, what we are doing with the rest of the budget for next year is saying that this is permanent now.  I refer to the extra beds, critical care beds, ward beds, community beds, community assessment hubs and the extra staff that we are hiring.  We have designed the budget to bring capacity up for the winter really quickly but then lock it in as permanent capacity.

I put in a lot of work but, unfortunately, I could not attend.  I wanted to be in the Chamber today and partake in the debate but there was an annual EU health ministers meeting that I could not get out of.  I had to be there, for obvious reasons, so I apologise for not attending the debate.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy will know from the countermotion, we have secured an exemption to allow student nurses access to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  One of the things that the INMO quite rightly put to me was that there are student nurses who do not qualify for PUP because a job still exists but the nurses cannot take it up.  Students who were working in a shop or bar that had to close are entitled to PUP because that job is not there.  However, some student nurses found themselves in a position whereby their job still existed, the agency was still hiring or the care home was still taking people in, but, for obvious reasons related to Covid-19, those nurses could not possibly be working in a hospital during the week and a nursing home at the weekend.  There were infection prevention reasons that could not happen.  I did not think that was fair at all so we have secured an exemption for these students if they can show any loss of earnings.  Anyone who can say they were earning money and are not any more will get PUP, and this exemption applies only to them.  I have also secured a commitment that any healthcare costs associated with getting sick at work will be covered.<\/p> <p>  The INMO was keen for an independently verified review to take place which would not just reflect the Department's view of the world.

At the start, there was not a lot of it but the HSE, in fairness, was trying to do something that no one had ever done before.  It took over an entire hospital sector.  There were legal and IR implications and all sorts of different implications.  As quickly as it could, the HSE began to get the volumes up.  I was getting replies to parliamentary questions showing that the volumes of care were going up, although they did not at the start.  Perhaps it could have worked better.  The Chairman will remember the pressure the HSE was under in taking over a whole hospital system and having it ready overnight.  We were all afraid of the worst-case scenario in which our public hospitals filled up and we would end up with thousands of Covid-19 patients quickly filling up the private hospitals as well.  The Army was setting up tents in car parks.  That needed to be looked at, and it has been, to inform our current talks with the private hospitals.

The Minister was talking about the issue of community paramedicine.  I have raised this matter before and have seen no evidence of a change for the coming year.  We have taken on an additional 21,500 whole-time staff in the HSE.  Including part-time people and everything else, 30,000 extra people are now working in the HSE compared with five years ago.  Of that, only 70 are public health nurses.<\/p> <p>  I put this question to representatives of Sl&aacute;intecare who were before the committee.  They were shocked that only 70 additional public health nurses have been taken on in recent years.  We have gone from 1,560 public health nurses to 1,630, there or thereabouts, and I have seen no evidence that that will change.  The Minister talks about community paramedicine.  We need nurses in the community.<\/p> <p>  A similar situation also applies to public health doctors.  I am advised that at the most recent meeting, the Department was prepared to allow only 30 people in under that category.  There was no agreement over all public health doctors.  It seems to be sending out the wrong messages.  On the one hand, we have Sl&aacute;intecare saying one thing and, on the other hand, there is a policy that allowed an increase of 20.9% across all sectors of healthcare in the past five years, including nurses, junior doctors, consultants and administrative staff, while there has been less than a 5% increase of public health nurses.  Are we serious about Sl&aacute;intecare or is it all bluster?  I am becoming more and more convinced that a lot of it is bluster.  I can see no evidence that we are recruiting people to work in the public healthcare sector.  That is one issue.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise relates to cataract operations.  I raised this at the previous meeting and I raise it again.  The response I got from the HSE was nothing but downright appalling.  All I got back was a memo defending people travelling abroad to Northern Ireland for cataract operations, without any response to the question I had raised, which was about having people examined at an early stage, put on the list for the procedure and then, if the public health sector cannot deal with doing the cataract operation, it comes in under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  There was no reply to that question.  The reply I got was appalling and extremely defensive of the fact that we are sending people out of the country to have a basic operation.  That really needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  There is a third issue on which I wish to touch.  My understanding is that there are 685 applications for GP training this year.  That is the largest number ever.  One in eight of our existing GPs are over 60.  What can we do?<\/p><p>Can additional training places be provided?  Obviously, that would be done with co-operation.  For a GP to go into training, he or she needs a practice that is prepared to take him or her on and go through the whole programme.  What discussions have been held with the Department about increasing the number of GP trainees in order that we will have enough people in three to five years' time to fill the vacancies that arise?<\/p><p> I wish to refer to an issue that I raised recently with Revenue.  We gave a special dispensation to meat factories to bring in people to work in particular jobs and earn less than &euro;30,000.  Some of my colleagues have mentioned that we need people in the community to provide home care and everything else.  A huge number of people live in the same home as those to whom they provide 24-7 care five days a week.  As happens in other countries, these carers are provided with food and accommodation.  However, the cost of providing accommodation and food is not taken into account by Revenue when assessing people for tax purposes.  Let us say that a person wants to bring in someone from abroad who is experienced in the provision of home care and care of the elderly.  The same criteria are not in place for people from abroad to come here and provide home care.  Interestingly, in Israel, more than 5,000 people are allowed to enter to provide home care full-time because there are not enough people to do the work and we will face that challenge here as well.  We need to provide a home care package where people call two or three times a day to different individuals.  However, there are those who need permanent home care.  I ask that this issue be examined.<\/p><p> In terms of the community healthcare issue, I am not convinced that this happens and there is no evidence to support the claim.  Can the Minister indicate where in HSE budget has money been set aside to deal with this matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2020120200002#L00600","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606867200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I will go through the various questions and the Deputy is free to tell me to stop whenever he wants.  The overall question is linked to the community healthcare question of whether Sl&aacute;intecare is for real.  For me, Sl&aacute;intecare is a roadmap to universal healthcare and having high-quality care when people need it.  I am taking this matter deadly seriously and I hope the Deputy can see that from the &euro;600 million winter plan and the budget for next year, which is the biggest additional healthcare budget in recent times, possibly ever.  It has the single biggest target ever for acute beds, critical care beds, hospital doctors, hospital nurses, community beds, step-down beds, rehabilitation beds and community clinicians, which is daunting because this is a massive task.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy will see when he looks at the budget, we have very deliberately broken it up into big chunks one of which relates to community care.  We are looking at a level of investment in community care for next year that is unprecedented for all of the reasons he outlined.  This is in today's Revised Estimate because it included &euro;200 million of the &euro;600 million winter plan.  If one considers the whole approach to the winter plan, it is exactly that.  It is home care hours, GP access to diagnostics, public health nursing and home intervention teams.  Let me give a brilliant example.  There is a pilot scheme, called frailty teams, at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, County Dublin.  Teams of an advanced paramedic, advanced nurse practitioners, occupational therapists and, sometimes, consultant doctors are sent to the houses of people who normally would be brought to the emergency department of St. Vincent's Hospital.  The teams stabilise people in their homes.  The cars that accompany the teams contain some advanced diagnostic equipment.  The teams can conduct a teleconference with the emergency departments and specialists at St. Vincent's and in St. Columcille's.  The pilot scheme has led to a 90% reduction in the number of people having to go to hospital.

Clearly, the Estimate is massive and perhaps we need to examine how it is done.  Maybe we should provide supports for committee members.  We do it for overseas aid and it is done in other parliaments.  It is something that we should consider.  I did not got a sense that we have dug into the Estimates and where the money will be spent.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the national children's hospital because I am unsure about the funding, particularly the &euro;107 million underspend.  A couple of weeks ago, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was before the joint committee.  Its representatives talked about the difficulties they face with hundreds of claims being before the High Court and the project being behind schedule.  We also heard that the Tallaght urgent care centre is seven months behind and how they were worried about a big claim.  On the one hand, we are saying that there has been an underspend but, on the other, we clearly know that there will be a demand.<\/p><p>It is clear there will be an overspend, not necessarily this year but certainly next year.  Is that budgeted for?  We are also told that 15% per month to the contractor, BAM, was being withheld.  Does that come under the Minister's Department?  How is that held?  We do not have the time to go into them today but those are some of my concerns about it.  <\/p><p> To get back to the Tallaght Hospital issue, a 72-bed unit project is with HBS Estates.  We are told it is needed because of the number of elderly people presenting at the accident and emergency department but also because of the young population in the area.  Is there any way of fast-tracking that because it is in an area of high unemployment and also because we need more beds within the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2020120200002#M01400","speaker":"1571","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606867200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Chairman but I was taking a note.

All of us have been in hospitals when people were informed that their loved one was going to die.  I was in a hospital one night when someone was dying on a trolley.  A man nearby was being transferred to a bed and there was much effing and blinding, so to speak, while this woman was dying with her family around her.  There is a need for those family palliative care systems within hospitals.<\/p> <p>  We are bringing in the people involved in the vaccine in two weeks time.  The main concern is the hesitancy on the part of many people with regard to vaccines, particularly across Europe.  In the past decade the numbers have gone down again.  As one of the members said earlier, there is a need for a campaign around the efficacy of the drugs we are getting but also their safety and the speed with which they are being made available.  That conversation needs to be had with this committee at some stage but also with the wider population.  I am aware from talking to people that many want to get the vaccine but many others would prefer to get one from the next batch rather than the first.  We need to convince them in that regard.  Other vaccines were introduced in recent years and there was not the desired take-up of them.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  He might get back to me regarding some of the questions.
