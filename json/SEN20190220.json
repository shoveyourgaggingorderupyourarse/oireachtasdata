I had hoped the Minister, Deputy Harris, would be here but I know he is a busy man.  <\/p> <p>I have been inundated with calls from people with serious concerns regarding dental care for children in CHO5.  The HSE provides dental services to children up to aged 16.  Children attending primary schools can be referred to dental treatment by a child health service or following a routine school visit.  Children attending primary schools are screened in second, fourth and sixth class and, if necessary, are referred to the local dental clinic for treatment.  Some children are referred to an orthodontic clinic for further treatment.  This referral is from the principal dental surgeon in the health centre and orthodontic treatment is free.  An individual's access to orthodontic treatment is determined by guidelines known as the \"modified index of treatment need\".  Emergency services are also available to all schoolgoing children but mainly on a part-time, specific weekday basis.  There is nothing but costly private dental care for children on weekends.<\/p> <p>I recently heard from constituents who have a child with a baby tooth that would not fall out going for a two-second tweezer extraction on a Saturday that cost them &euro;75, for which the tooth fairy gave them back &euro;2.  We all know who lost out.  The Minister of State will be aware of the great benefits of the scheme.  Many children are caught early and encouraged to ensure good dental hygiene and there is often a need to undertake only minimal work to prevent major work in the future.  However, there is a serious problem with the scheme.  Data published last month by the Irish Dental Association indicate that more than 80,000 children and adolescents are waiting for a public dental assessment or treatment, of which 22,900 are on the waiting list in CHO5, which takes in Carlow-Kilkenny, south Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford.  In almost every area of society early intervention saves time, money and distress and produces far better outcomes.  <\/p> <p>How does the Minister propose to tackle the unacceptable delays in this scheme?  It is not good enough that hard pressed parents are forced to pay for the treatment their child or children urgently need.  Many of them cannot afford it.  The aim of the scheme is to provide dental care for every child regardless of means.  It is a wonderful idea but it is not working.  According to the Irish Dental Association, the waiting list numbers are shocking.  Its spokesperson, Dr. Gillian Smith, said that due to the delays around assessments children were enduring painful episodes and being treated with antibiotics and, often, surgery under general anaesthetic, which is costly to the State and easily prevented with early intervention.<\/p> <p>The incredible waiting lists have been highlighted by hundreds of my constituents in just two counties in CHO5.  I imagine hundreds more in the other counties are not complaining because they realise we are all being forced into a two-tier system, whether we like it.  People feel they have to pay for everything.  What is the Department of Health doing to reduce waiting lists in this area?  On the modified index of treatment need, many children appear to be just outside the threshold.  In 2013, the HSE commissioned an independent review of orthodontic services.  Something is wrong if orthodontic services across the country are offering easy pay plans for taxpayers to have their children treated because the HSE is not getting the job done.<\/p> <p>It was revealed late last year that there is a 12 month waiting list for orthodontic treatment in my area.  That is a long time for a child suffering with a grade four diagnosis, which may mean speech difficulties or protruding displacement of teeth, or a child with a grade five diagnosis and abnormally arranged teeth, not to mention the child whose diagnosis is minimally outside of the guidelines in terms of access to treatment.  Parents are forced to pay for this treatment.  On 4 February last, the Minister, Deputy Harris, said on RT&Eacute; radio that it is his job to look after the health of the children of Ireland.  The delays in the dental assessment and treatment area are unacceptable.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer my questions today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#A00600","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health who sends his apologies for not being here.

Eligibility for dental services is provided for in the Health Act 1970.  Dental treatment for adult medical card holders is provided under the dental treatment services scheme by contracted general dental practitioners.  The HSE provides oral healthcare services to children and vulnerable people of all ages including people with special needs, people with disabilities and people who are medically compromised.  It also includes cohorts such as refugees and asylum seekers.  Services are provided on the basis of need and include four key areas, namely emergency care; targeted preventive and treatment services for children; planned care for children and adults with special care needs; and hospital services, including general anaesthetic services.  Targeted preventive and treatment services for children emphasise prevention of dental disease through patient and parent oral health education, dietary advice and tooth-brushing instruction, along with preventive interventions such as the placement of fissure sealants on vulnerable tooth surfaces.  Restorative treatment such as fillings is also available.  Children in the targeted age groups are typically in first or second class and sixth class.  Where resources allow, some children may also be seen in fourth class.  <\/p><p>CHO 5, now known as South East Community Healthcare, provides community health and social care services within south-eastern counties of Waterford, Wexford, South Tipperary, Carlow and Kilkenny.  Recent HSE figures indicate that as of 1 January 2019 there were 35,466 in second, fourth and sixth classes in the South East Community Healthcare area.  A number of these children would have been seen during January and to date in February.  It should be noted that the service which these children receive is a screening service - the Deputy is correct that prevention is the best measure against more serious challenges - provided for children at key ages to coincide with eruption of back teeth and once parental consent is given.  This is an ongoing rolling programme for routine dental care.  The emphasis is on preventive care such as fissure sealants and advice with fillings provided if necessary.  <\/p><p>There are 2,198 awaiting treatment following screening.  It should be noted that some children may be counted twice, for example where they are to be seen by a hygienist for preventive care and by a dentist for treatment following their assessment.  Following a fire in the St. Dympna&rsquo;s Hospital Carlow in November 2016, dental services ceased.  This resulted in the cancellation of four surgeries for four months.  Additional services using agency staff and additional clinics during evenings and weekends were used in 2017 to address the backlog in appointments.  The dental service is still dealing with some backlogs in appointments as a result.  The Minister is aware of this and is trying to deal with it.  While there are ongoing difficulties in recruitment and retention of dentists in the South East Community Healthcare area, two vacancies were filled in 2018, and we hope to recruit more in the coming year.  The HSE will continue to prioritise patients with greatest needs.  Emergency care for the relief of pain and infection is available for all children aged up to 15 years, and patients with special needs on a same day or following day basis at HSE dental clinics across the country.  Approximately 6,000 children attend for emergency treatment each month nationally. <\/p><p>The Minister is very much aware of concerns and the specific issues in this area.  He is committed to filling the vacancies, reducing waiting lists and ensuring that the children, not only in this area but also surrounding areas, are treated in the appropriate manner and as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#A00700","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I was aware of the fire at St. Dymphna's and the resulting backlog.

Teasta&iacute;onn uaim ceist a ard&uacute; ar luaigh m&eacute; ar an Ord Gn&oacute; sa Teach seo ar 6 Feabhra.  I raise an issue which I mentioned briefly during the Order of Business on 6 February.  It is estimated that approximately 25% of students have special educational needs of one kind or another.  Legislation envisages the provision of individual educational plans, IEPs, for many of these children.  These are written plans prepared for a student specifying the learning goals to be achieved over a set period, as well as teaching strategies, support and resources necessary to achieve those goals.  The value of these plans is accepted and they are implemented across the world including in the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.  The Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004, or EPSEN Act, includes a requirement for schools to provide an individualised education plan for students with special needs.  However, this section of the Act has not been commenced 14 years after it was passed by these Houses.  The National Council for Special Education developed guidelines on the provision of individual education plans in 2006, which is now 12 years ago.<\/p><p>In response to a Parliamentary Question on 4 December, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, told the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>There is currently not a statutory requirement for schools to provide a mandatory Individual Education Plan for children with special needs. [...]<br \/><br \/>However, all schools are encouraged to use some form of educational planning for the delivery of additional teaching, or care supports, for children with special educational needs [...]<br \/><br \/>My Department's Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of education planning for children with special educational needs. <\/blockquote> <p>Despite the Oireachtas passing a law requiring schools to implement these plans 14 years ago, this remains to be commenced or brought into force.  The position, as the Minister told the D&aacute;il, is that we are relying on the goodwill of teachers and the ability of individual schools to implement individual education plans from their own resources.  This state of affairs changed before Christmas when the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, issued advice to its members not to implement IEPs due to a lack of adequate resourcing.  A circular to its members on 18 December 2018:<\/p><blockquote>In view of the fact that IEPs have not commenced under the EPSEN Act, ASTI members are advised not to implement IEPs or equivalents [...]. <br \/><br \/>The ASTI is extremely concerned that in the context of insufficient resourcing and the lack of a sustainable model for the delivery of all aspects of the EPSEN Act [...]<br \/><br \/>The ASTI rejects the imposition of a special education needs model which takes no account of the time, workload and practical implications for teachers and schools. <\/blockquote> <p>I understand that the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, has given similar advice to its members.  While the ASTI made clear that this would not affect any existing plans in place, this is nonetheless very worrying.  How is it defensible that 14 years after the passage of the 2004 Act that IEPs have not been given force of law?  How can it be acceptable that the teachers themselves feel that they cannot provide these plans due to a lack of resources?  We are all aware of the seeming inability of some Departments to manage public finances in a prudent way, causing massive potential waste of Exchequer resources.  It would be horrible to think that this would be one area that would suffer the downstream consequences of such mismanagement.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could give me any assurance today that that is not the case.  I would be grateful if she could give me a response that goes further and offers more than the Minister's response in the D&aacute;il some months ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#B00500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to outline the position on educational planning in schools on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Department of Education and Skills recently wrote to the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland to reiterate to them the importance of planning for pupils with special educational needs in schools and to note that provision has been made for such planning.  Under the Education Act, schools have a legal duty to provide an appropriate education to all students.  The Senator is correct to state there is no statutory requirement for schools to provide a particular form of individual educational plans but there is a statutory obligation to provide education appropriate to the abilities and needs of students.  This includes people with special educational needs and, obviously, schools need to plan to ensure this happens.<\/p><p>Planning is a normal part of a teacher's work and planning tools, such as the student support file, have been created as a resource to help schools provide for their students.  The Government has invested heavily in recent years in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8 billion spent annually, which is approximately &euro;1 in every &euro;5 of the education budget.  This is 20%, which is close enough to the figure the Senator mentioned with regard to those needing special support in our schools.  I assure the Senator there is no mismanagement of funding and the &euro;1.8 billion is being spent very much appropriately. <\/p><p>All mainstream schools are provided with special education teachers, based on the profiled needs of the school, to provide extra teaching support for pupils who have additional learning needs in schools.  At present, there are almost 14,000 special education teachers in schools, an increase of more than 37% since 2011.  This has greatly increased the number of special education teachers who have been allocated to schools throughout the country.<\/p><p>The Department's circulars 0013 and 0014 of 2017, which set out the basis for the allocation of special education teachers to schools, note the importance of educational planning.  This is to ensure that children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.  The circulars note that educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils' needs.  The circulars also note that in making allocations for special education teachers to schools, provision is made within the total allocation for planning and co-ordination activities.<\/p><p>Circular 0014 of 2017 for post-primary schools states the allocation for special education teaching support being provided for schools includes provision for planning and co-ordination activities required to ensure the most effective use of the special educational needs hours provided to schools for children.  The extent of co-ordination time required to be used by schools will vary depending on the number of students requiring additional teaching support and the number of teachers proving this support.  It is noted, however, that planning for the provision of additional teaching support for pupils in schools is an important part of the process, and that co-ordination and planning time for this has been acknowledged in the allocation.  Schools, therefore, should be resourced to carry out planning.<\/p><p>Support and guidance for schools on how best to carry out educational planning is available from the National Council for Special Education support service and the National Educational Psychological Service.  The Department's advice is that the majority of schools do carry out some form of educational planning for pupils with special educational needs.  This is an appropriate use of the significant levels of additional special education teaching resources that have been provided for schools.  The ongoing provision of planning should represent a continuation of the good practice that is already occurring in the majority of schools throughout the country.<\/p><p>I reiterate that no projects or investment in education, including in special needs, will be amended or reduced in the coming months or years because of another project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#B00600","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I reassure her that in talking about the potential downstream consequences of mismanagement I do not suggest mismanagement of the existing budgetary allocation to the area of special needs in education, I am talking about the wider mismanagement of public money in the economy and, therefore, the lack of necessary extra and additional resourcing.  The Minister of State made the point she estimates the approximately 20% of the budget, at approximately &euro;1.8 billion, going to special educational needs is not far off the quota of students with special educational needs of one type or another.  Surely, when we speak about children with special educational needs, we imagine there would be a greater percentage of resources and not a slightly lesser percentage of resources dedicated to their needs.  Why are individual education plans in the legislation if they have not been provided?

A total of &euro;1.8 billion is spent annually and this is having a significant impact throughout the country.<\/p> <p>There is no statutory requirement to provide a particular form of individual education but there is a statutory obligation to provide education to students appropriate to their abilities and needs.  The Minister has already outlined that the vast majority of schools provide these plans.  They are focusing on where there are clear measurable learning targets, specifying the resources and interventions used to address student needs.  This is in line with the continuum of support process.  While subject teachers retain overall responsibility for the provision of education to students, in most instances special education teachers will develop the student support plans.  Teachers are working with their students and with parents, families and the school to ensure the plans are in place.  The Department informs me the supports and resources are there but if the Senator has information to the contrary I will pass it on to the Minister, who will continue to engage with the TUI and ASTI to ensure children receive the adequate support they require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#C00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coastal Protection","time":1550658600,"counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#C00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.

Further to that, my office, through the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme, provides a funding mechanism to support works to protect coastal communities, particularly those at risk from flooding.  In this regard, the OPW minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme provides funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation, coastal protection works or studies costing less than &euro;750,000 each to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  In 2015, Clare County Council received funding of &euro;65,000 from the OPW under this scheme for a coastal erosion and risk management study from Quilty to Miltown Malbay, which produced recommendations for works at Spanish Point, County Clare.  In September 2018, on foot of those recommendations, Clare County Council made an application to the OPW for funding for the provision of rock armour to protect against cliff erosion caused by waves and tides at Spanish Point.  This application is currently under consideration.  As soon as a decision is made on this application, this will issue to the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#C00500","speaker":"1363","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for a comprehensive reply.

A massive system was put in place to encourage them to come back but, to my knowledge, one lieutenant colonel and one captain have applied to come back and be commissioned.  In inviting people to return, the authorities have not ring-fenced the appointments to prevent those returning from progressing to the next rank.  If, for the sake of argument, a commandant returns and a vacancy for a lieutenant colonel arises, that commandant, who may have been out of the system for ten years, is suddenly eligible to apply for promotion to the post.  That is grossly unfair to those who remained in the Air Corps.  In the teaching profession, those who leave teaching and return not only return at the bottom of the scale but do so at the bottom of the new scale.  It is grossly unfair to entice people who have left and enjoyed a period in the private sector, possibly earning big money with some of the commercial airlines, to come back and start closing off promotional posts for those who have remained loyal to the State and stayed behind.  More important, who dreamt up this idea?  Who dreamt up the idea that the only way we can solve the problem of losing members of the Army, Air Corps and Navy is by asking people who have retired to come back?  Where is that coming from?

A key mechanism for addressing the potential for abuse in institutions is to ensure independent and regular inspections.  Inspections shine a light on otherwise closed and hidden spaces, often the common thread of institutional abuse.  Providing for such inspections is the central idea behind the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, OPCAT, which Ireland has yet to ratify.<\/p> <p>Even after the litany of revelations of institutional and historical abuse in Ireland, our inspection regime is seriously flawed.  There is no inspection body for those detained in Garda stations following arrest.  The inspectorate of prisons has published only one prison inspection report since 2014.  There is no oversight body for direct provision centres or nursing homes, and many existing inspection mechanisms are not clearly entitled under law to conduct unannounced and regular inspections.<\/p> <p>Under OPCAT, Ireland would be required to establish a national preventive mechanism, which is a co-ordinated inspection regime that is independent of government and has real powers.  Independent inspectors could go to any place of detention unannounced and inspect any part of the residence.  These would not just be in settings that we traditionally think of as detention centres, such as prisons or Garda stations, because many people are deprived of their liberty in health and social care settings, including immigration detention facilities, psychiatric hospitals, care homes, secure accommodation for children and nursing homes.  People with disabilities, older people or those in addiction can be subjected to coercive practices in care, such as the withholding or overuse of vital medicine.  Thorough and sustained monitoring and oversight of all these places is needed in order to protect people from inhuman or degrading treatment.  Ireland signed OPCAT in 2007 but has not ratified it, which means that the Government does not have to comply with its requirements.  What are the Government's plans in this area and when we can expect Ireland to ratify OPCAT?  As we know from the experience with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, this can happen separately to the legislative process.<\/p> <p>I will also oppose the change to Standing Orders if it comes to a vote.  The change seems to suit the current needs of Government Senators.  The quorum is one of the few parliamentary tactics we have in opposition.  Regardless of whether I agree that it has been abused, I definitely do not want to shoot myself in the foot, particularly if I need to abuse at some point in the future in the context of legislation in which I have a vested interest.  I will oppose the change to Standing Orders if it comes to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#H01900","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I refer to the response of the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday regarding Spinraza.  Parents and sufferers alike received bad news after months and months of raising this issue and waiting for a response.  The HSE, yet again, has not been held accountable for how it negotiates an acceptable price with Biogen, the maker of Spinraza.  Practically every other European country has managed to negotiate a deal with Biogen but, in 18 months, the HSE has failed patients here.  That is not acceptable.  The rare diseases technology review committee has recommended Spinraza to be supplied on a managed access programme so that the cost can be managed but the corporate pharmaceutical unit, CPU, seems unable to act to communicate what an acceptable deal would look like.  The lack of any communication with the patient group over the past 18 months by the HSE is highly disrespectful and unacceptable.  The CPU has to be held accountable for this.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in whom Fianna F&aacute;il will show confidence later today, has not shown any interest in doing this or in offering to meet the families.  I appeal to him to meet these families in order to discuss the matter.  We are talking about a small number of children.<\/p> <p>Another issue that affects children is the audiology test that deviated from best practice.  I accompanied parents of affected children to meetings with the HSE on one occasion and asked the official present if there were any more cases apart from the 49 identified.  I was told \"No\".  Time and again, we were all told \"No\" and that there were 49 cases.  There are Senators sitting in this Chamber who know that this is true.  From my experience of other scandals, the initial figure given of agencies and companies rarely gives the full picture.  We now know that 60 more cases have been identified.  Many of these children are in the late stages of development and have gone misdiagnosed for years.  In many cases, there may be permanent or reversible damage.  Some of these children had already underlying disabilities.  I ask that the fault, wherever it lies in the review process, be addressed so that absolutely everybody who is affected can be contacted and adequate treatment and support be provided.  We need an inquiry into this.  It is obvious that the governance was not in place here and that, again, nobody was accountable.  That is why a review is needed.  Some of the 49 cases do not even have their medical card applications approved.  The buck must stop somewhere.  This matter is evidence of another failing on the part of the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>Finally, regarding the news that only 11,334 persons out of the 206,000 who have been taken on by JobPath remained in employment for over 12 months, the two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, received full payment for every one of these referrals.  In fact, they received double payments.  The D&aacute;il has passed the motion calling for the end of mandatory referrals.  I want the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to come before the House to discuss this matter because this is where it originated.  In December 2016, I and my colleague, former Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, raised the scandal of JobPath.  Incidentally, the Taoiseach was Minister for Social Protection when that contract was negotiated.

I want to raise an issue of concern in respect of how a vulnerable group of people who work in Ireland are treated by the system.  In doing so, I wish highlight an article, written by Ms Felicity Lawrence and the Irish journalist, Ms Ella McSweeney, in today's edition of <i>The Guardian<\/i>, that draws attention to the human rights abuses of migrant fishermen who are working in the Irish system.  Troublingly, this condemnation comes not simply from a politician, a trade unionist or somebody from an NGO, but from four high-ranking UN rapporteurs on human rights, trafficking, modern slavery and racial discrimination.  I read the letter because I received it last week from the International Transport Workers Federation, the union operating to protect the interests of seafarers.  It is a damning indictment of how we treat migrant fishermen in this country.  The rapporteurs believe that the atypical permanent scheme in place at present leaves migrant workers open to exploitation, trafficking and human slavery.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is a shocking indictment of this country.  One of the problems is that the visa is tied to just one employer.  One can imagine a vulnerable migrant worker putting a hand up to say they have not been paid, have been worked to sickness and are not being protected.  If they put their hand up, they lose that right to work here because they have overstepped the mark with their employer when they are tied to that one employer.  We can imagine all of the problems associated with that.<\/p><p>I have personally dealt with a considerable number of migrant fishers from north Africa who, in my opinion and in the opinion of the UN rapporteurs, are being exploited, are in a very vulnerable position and are not being protected by the atypical permits scheme in place here at the moment.  I am on public record as challenging that scheme in this House, in the media and elsewhere.  The scheme needs to be scrapped and the Ministers for Justice and Equality, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Business, Enterprise and Innovation need to work with the International Transport Workers' Federation to ensure we have a pipeline of workers from outside of Europe and the EEA states who are willing and able to work in the fishing industry in this country, but that they are protected and there is a scheme in place that respects their human rights, vindicates their rights and supports them.  At the moment, this scheme is simply not working and it is open to abuse and to exploitation.

For many the idea of working from rural Ireland is increasingly attractive.  There are some who would love to return to their home place, and others who desire to get away from the traffic and higher costs associated with city living.  For these people, working from home or from a shared workspace in a local town is the ideal.  An organisation has now been set up to help people to do just that. Grow Remote is an organisation that has only been set up recently but already has 40 chapters all over the country.  According to one survey on remote working, 62% of people do not work remotely because they do not know how to get started and fear they will not have a work community to share things with.  Grow Remote has been set up entirely by volunteers and is addressing these issues.  I was surprised to learn that 200,000 people are already working remotely full-time or part-time in Ireland.  This organisation provides them with an opportunity to meet with each other, network, share ideas and information and organise resources where they deem it necessary.<\/p> <p>The nature of debate in this House often means that we hear negative stories on negative issues, but this is a good news story.  It is a story of people who got together and are trying to make life better for themselves and their communities.  A group like this would be very welcome in my own home town of Athlone.  It would complement current plans for a high-speed hub on the west side of Athlone and make it more attractive to live and work in the midlands.  We all know that Athlone is the centre of the universe.  Two weeks ago, Grow Remote addressed the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development and was very well received.  I am asking the Leader to ask the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, and other Ministers to do whatever they can to help this organisation so that people can live and work in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>On the subject of the quorum, I feel strongly that Senator Craughwell and others are against the idea of reducing the quorum.  These people want new politics.  They want to have a leaders' and whips' meeting every week.

This is only surpassed by eastern European states.  One in every four children in Ireland is at risk of poverty.  We are now an outlier in Europe for low pay.

I have been working with those parents since last August to set up cross-departmental supports to ensure that these children, who have had a difficult start, are able to access their full potential.

Eir reports data to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on ongoing rural fibre deployment in accordance with the commitment agreement signed with the Department in April 2017.  It is not funded by the State and not planned, designed or directed by the Department in any capacity, according to quarter 3 2018 figures provided by Eir to the Department.  The company has passed over 200,000 premises as part of its ongoing deployment and I had a lady in my clinic the other day who said it is called low hanging fruit if no easy access can be found.<\/p> <p>My concern is not with the deployment of this, however.  Some 180 towns and cities will benefit from the massive fixed network investment programme announced by Eir.  This is good news for the many and in my area it is great to get this kind of connection.  My concern is with Eir and its communication with its customers.  Eir was taken over by an investment consortium in April 2018.  If we are trusting it with deploying rural broadband to the country, we need to look at how it is treating its existing customers.  Eir customers are currently facing longer than normal and much longer than acceptable wait times when contacting the customer care call centre.  They are often told to go online to web chat, only to then be told to go back on the phone.  Many more have complained that Eir's service is not working and they cannot get out of a contract.  Others complain that reported faults are never fixed, despite promises that technicians will come out.  Hundreds of customers have complained to national newspapers and to social media.  Are we to expect this kind of customer service when the massive fixed network investment programme is completed?  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment needs to come into this Chamber to reassure us that customers will be treated better in future.  We cannot allow this to happen.  This is very serious for rural Ireland.  We need to make sure that rural Ireland gets this service.

In Cork last Monday, there was a protest outside the offices of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in respect of a Mandate decision in July 2008.  There was a recommendation that supervisors and assistant supervisors would be brought in under a pension scheme.  In fairness to them, they are successful in helping people on these schemes to return to work and provide a valuable service at local level.  SOLAS will argue that because they are not directly employed by the organisation, it has no responsibility in funding the pension they wish to join.  On the other hand, all those who are employing the supervisors and assistant supervisors under the CE schemes are in voluntary organisations which do not have significant resources to dip into and, therefore, do not have adequate funding to cover these people in pension schemes.  This matter needs to be dealt with because the schemes have worked very well in local communities over a long period and they have also worked for people who have found it difficult to get employment.  It is something that we cannot allow to go on for another ten years and it should be dealt with.

There is a clear appetite for reform.  During Question Time last week, the Taoiseach indicated that not only had the Cabinet failed to discuss the report, but that he was not in favour of the proposals and then he failed to give a commitment about when the Seanad Bill would be brought forward.

Under the EU directive on consumer rights, consumers are entitled to a 14-day cooling off period for any purchases online for any reason.  There is an anomaly, however, when it comes to airlines.  They are a different business to many other online providers but a 24-hour cooling off period should apply to airlines for non-immediate flights.  Simple mistakes or spelling errors can cause people expense and worry about their travel, and older people are often less adept at dealing with these issues online.  Airlines are outliers in this area and the small print and terms and conditions are often dense and intentionally vague.

The everyday impacts of a hard Brexit are becoming clear to the public.  Last Monday, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, outlined potential knock-on effects for the alarm system currently allowing elderly people to stay in their homes.  The seniors alert scheme provides funding for personal monitored alarms.  That system allows people over 65 years old to stay in their homes.  The scheme has been a great success for many people throughout rural Ireland.  It gives a sense of security, contentment and peace of mind.

I was contacted by a number of people earlier seeking solace and reassurance from the Government regarding the issues raised by him.   The main issue is that much of the equipment used under the seniors alert scheme is sourced in the UK.  There may be issues with that supply in the event of a hard Brexit.  It sends out a clear message that the Government needs to be alert now and Ministers need to be on the ball in their Departments.  It is important to investigate an alternative source for that equipment in another country.  I call on the Leader to ensure the Minister and his Department are on the ball in doing that.  Sourcing another supplier for the system in another state will give peace of mind.

There has been great upset and turmoil in the industry in the past six to eight months.  Since Christmas, in particular, there has not been a major increase in price.  That has been a major issue throughout rural Ireland.  The key reason there has been no increase in price is the large number of cattle killed in Ireland.  At one stage, 40,000 animals a week were being killed.  That is extraordinarily high compared to the numbers usually killed.  Traditionally, 20,000 to 30,000 animals were killed.  Much of the increase relates to the expansion of the dairy herd, as well as Friesian bull calves coming through the system.  Those changes are depressing the price because there is only a certain demand for beef.  Unless we move large numbers of Friesian bull calves in the next few weeks, this cycle will continue in two years when those cattle will be finished.  We can move more than 80,000 animals a week off of the island using ferry services and hauliers.  It needs to be ensure that those animals are moved.  There is a market for them in France but there is a problem in Cherbourg with lairage.  That problem needs to be examined. <\/p> <p>This industry is a key part of rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland will slowly die away unless we support the industry.  We need a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Creed.  He needs to have a round-table discussion, not particularly with us, but with the transport people, the lairage owners and departmental officials on how the blockage in the system can be removed.  That must be done to ensure animals can be transported.  The knock-on effect will be to reduce our national herd but also to increase the monetary return to farmers. <\/p> <p>There has been a large increase in production following the Food Wise 2025 initiative but profitability at the farm gate has gone in the opposite direction.  Farmers are working harder to produce more to earn less.  That is not viable.  We need a debate on this issue.  I appreciate I am over time and I will finish on this.

The point being made by people on this side of the House is that a quorum should not be just the responsibility of Government, although it is.  We are in a minority situation and therefore there is an obligation on all sides of the House to ensure that the sitting of the day commences.  Senator Craughwell being all for new politics will embrace that.<\/p> <p>I commend Senators Ruane and Nash on their remarks this morning around protecting and upholding the human rights of our most vulnerable people.  This is a matter that requires urgent attention and ongoing inspection.  I understand the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, carries out regular inspections of our nursing homes.  The point the Senators made is very important.  I am happy to engage with them on the provision of a series of debates on the issue.  <\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of Spinraza.  I do not have information to hand in regard to the matter she raised this morning on the Order of Business.  Senators Conway-Walsh and Hopkins raised the audiology issues in the west.  It is unacceptable that there has been a breakdown in supports to young children and their families.  As Senator Hopkins rightly said there is need for cross-departmental engagement by the Departments of Education and Skills, Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Health, and the HSE in terms of accountability and to address the pathway to services for the young people and families who have been failed, notwithstanding that the HSE has apologised.  Senator Hopkins made a very telling contribution around the audiologist, whether that person remains in the employment of the HSE and, if so, in what area this person is employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#N02500","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>We know where he is.

It does not make reference to the fact that the national minimum wage, which is determined based on recommendations of the Low Pay Commission, provides a measure of security for the low paid.  Equally, it does not show in its clear form the supports and security measures put in place under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

Throughout my political life, I have tried to make a difference to the lives of ordinary people and make them a little bit better.  It is a rather simple philosophy of mine but I think I have achieved a lot by sticking to that ideal.

It means a great deal to an awful lot of people who have been campaigning for this for many years.  Senator Conway is right that people are cynical about politicians but when we sit down and work together, it is amazing what we can achieve.  The likes of Debbie Coll are the real champions of this.

Yesterday, we spoke about the issue of judicial vacancies and recommendations from the commission of persons for appointment.  The section states:<\/p><blockquote>(1) <i>Subsection (2) <\/i>applies where&mdash;(a) more than one judicial office in the same court stands vacant, or <br \/><br \/>(b) the following conditions are satisfied&mdash;<blockquote>(i) the Minister reasonably apprehends that more than one judicial office in the same court will stand vacant, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) the Commission has received a request of the Minister (which request shall be addressed to the Commission and which, by virtue of this subsection, the Minister has power to make) that the recommendation referred to in <i>subsection (2) <\/i>be made.<\/blockquote>(2) Where this subsection applies, the Commission shall, in accordance with this Act, recommend to the Minister, in respect of the judicial offices concerned, the names of such number of persons as is equal to the relevant number ranked in the order of the Commission&rsquo;s preference (and that expression of preference shall not make any distinction between the several vacancies concerned).<br \/><br \/>(3) In <i>subsection (2) <\/i>&quot;relevant number&quot; means the number obtained by multiplying by 2 the number of vacancies (or apprehended vacancies), and adding one to the product.<\/blockquote> <p>As we heard yesterday, section 41(3) would mean there would be five names for two vacancies and seven names for three vacancies.  The amendment Senators McDowell and Boyhan and I have proposed seeks to ring-fence the offices of the Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal, President of the High Court, President of the Circuit Court and President of the District Court.  I may be mistaken but yesterday I got the impression from the Minister that he would be somewhat favourably disposed to making this amendment.<\/p><p>Prior to debating the amendment, we had just finished a debate on the trickle-down effect in which we had been trying to outline the problem of trickle down.  In the case of this amendment, we did not want to mix up different expertise or requirements.  The appointment of the Chief Justice may require a set of skills that may not necessarily be commensurate with the appointment of an ordinary member of the Supreme Court.  From this point of view, we seek to ensure that these appointments are made discretely one by one and that, regardless of other vacancies, if a vacancy arose in the role of Chief Justice, it would be filled in its own right.  It makes perfect sense when we look at the structure of the courts that we would ensure we did not seek to fill from the same pool the commission had interviewed the role of an ordinary member of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice.  From this point of view, we hope the Minister will accept the amendment and what we are trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#CC01300","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I am pleased to resume debate on the amendment.  I remind the Senators that the policy of the Bill was to have a separate dedicated process in respect of senior judicial offices, namely, the Chief Justice, President of the High Court and President of the Court of Appeal, as was proposed in the original section 46 of the Bill.  I have no difficulty with this aspect of the amendment insofar as it relates to what we can describe, and what we have been describing, as the three most senior judicial posts.  I say this in the context of the overall architecture of the legislation, working from section 37 serving as a general explanatory provision to the effect that chapters 1 and 2 of Part 7 do not apply to procedures in respect of certain senior positions.  The three senior judicial posts are provided for separately in section 44 of chapter 3 of this Part.  There is, therefore, no necessity to have an exclusion in any part of chapter 2 that makes reference to the posts addressed in chapter 3, that is, in section 44.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have covered previously this issue of the disapplication of certain provisions to the three exceptionally senior positions.

The proposal to remove the offices of all the courts' presidents from the commission process, including the lower courts, is new.  I already indicated that I will come back with amendments to section 44 on Report Stage.  I acknowledge what Senators McDowell and Craughwell have said in that regard.  I want to see what I can do to expand the section 44 provision and I will consider that for Report Stage.  I am not sure whether Senator Craughwell is minded to withdraw the amendment in the meantime with a reservation of right on his behalf and on the part of Senator McDowell as well to come back on Report Stage in the event of them not being happy with what I bring forward.

This happened recently with a road traffic incident if I am not mistaken, and there have been various other incidents. <\/p><p>We made the point yesterday that those seeking elevation within the courts system or seeking appointment to senior judicial positions should not see their application disappear into the ether, with no feedback or information on what happened or where things went right or wrong.  Yesterday I made the point that natural justice requires that people who put a lot of effort into applying for positions are entitled to some sort of explanation as to whether they made the list or not.  That is what we are trying to provide here.  With the prospective paragraph 42(a) we hope to clarify whether the person was or was not among those recommended by the commission to the Government in respect of the appointment.  I accept that the insertion of this amendment will give rise to questions. People who did not make the shortlist may want to ask why.  It may also lead to a situation where the deliberations of the commission are subjected to judicial review of some sort or other.  Individuals may feel they should have been on the list if they are not.  We are trying to provide people with some sort of assurance that the procedures are fair, open and transparent.  This amendment does that. <\/p><p>To turn to paragraph (b), if the commission considers a person to be ineligible for appointment by reason of the requirements of section 35, and where the commission cannot make any recommendation in any case, it shall notify all persons who applied to it in respect of that appointment that it made no recommendation.

It might give rise to the fact that the advertisement was flawed and many other questions with respect to the selection process.  The selection process would have to be more robust than it would be without this amendment.  Every step would have to be assessed in advance for the likely impact of potential candidates.  The potential candidates could be reassured that once the application is submitted, they would know precisely for what they applied.  This is because the qualifications would have been set out properly in whatever advertisement was put forward and there could be no misunderstanding.<\/p><p>By having this amendment within the Bill, we would safeguard against the likelihood that people would apply incorrectly for a position for which they were not suitably qualified.  Yesterday we spoke about qualifications for the Chief Justice, specifically the depth of knowledge and experience that would be required for that job.  Somebody who recently qualified at the Bar could not apply for the position of Chief Justice as the advertisement would be very clear about the level of expertise, length of time in office and knowledge of the Irish language, for example.  All of these would be set out very clearly in any advertisement.  The likelihood that the commission would make a mistake in rejecting an application would be greatly diminished by virtue of the transparency brought by this amendment.<\/p><p>My colleagues, Senators McDowell and Boyhan, and I have always said the amendments we are putting forward are designed to support the Minister's Bill.  We are not trying to do away with the general thesis from the Minister.  Many people are saying that certain individuals in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are pushing the Bill and forcing the Minister and everybody else down this road.  I do not believe that but I believe it is the Minister's Bill; it will be his Bill forever as he has brought it before the Houses.  I do not necessarily believe it is the Bill he wanted and although it came from the programme for Government, the Minister would have done this differently if he had time to do so.  This amendment seeks to ensure any persons putting their names forward will be certain of what they are applying for and will have the necessary qualifications.  If those people are not selected, they will know this.<\/p><p>There is another matter.  We spoke about confidentiality.  A barrister, for example, may be chosen for a position that a learned judge may have applied for as well but where the judge did not make the list.  This would be serious and we would have to ensure the information in question would not get into the public domain, as it would have a fairly detrimental effect on the career of that learned judge.  This is where we walk a bit of a tightrope.  The individual who applied is entitled to know how he or she fared but the information is subject to confidentiality processes.  Somebody was here the other day shouting about something in the newspaper and demanding the Minister's head on a plate because something had allegedly been leaked from the Minister's Department.  All we need is a leak before we see all sorts of scenarios.  Natural justice would require that an individual should know if he or she has made a list.<\/p><p>In the education area in recent times positions have been advertised but a suitable candidate for the position has not been found even over two, three or four occasions.  Part of this is because of the onerous responsibility placed on people in senior positions and the public awareness, specifically arising from instant access to social media, etc.  It might prevent people from applying for positions, and we are talking about high-profile positions in the Judiciary.  If it is not possible to make a recommendation - as covered by section 42(b) - it would be very serious.  Apart from anything else, having to re-advertise the position would give rise to serious media speculation as to what went wrong, with ensuing questions.  Nevertheless, this is about the transparency all of us would like to see.  I await the Minister's comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#EE00900","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I have good news for Senator Craughwell as I will accept amendment No. 87b.

The select committee passed two Opposition amendments, at the time Nos. 139 and 140, to section 44 of the Bill as initiated.  The effects of those amendments are, first, to oblige the commission, when it has been unable to recommend a person for appointment, to re-advertise at three-monthly intervals until it is satisfied to recommend at least one person to fill the vacancy concerned and, second, to delete subsections (3) to (5), inclusive, of section 44 of the Bill as initiated, hence dispensing with the requirement that the commission, if it cannot recommend any names or recommends fewer than three names, provide to the Minister a statement of the name of every eligible applicant.  My Report Stage amendment in the D&aacute;il was unsuccessful in seeking to reverse the committee amendments and to reinstate the appropriate provisions of the Bill as initiated in what is now the section 42 before us.<\/p> <p>I am unhappy with the state of affairs left in place as a result of the amendment carried by the D&aacute;il committee.  We have to acknowledge the original purpose was to deal with probably an exceptional enough event, which was the situation where the commission could only recommend fewer than three names, that is, one or two, or in certain circumstances, none.  The general thrust of the provision is based on the corresponding provision in statute that provides for the work of the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The 1995 Act envisaged a situation where it might not be possible to recommend the then prescribed number and, in these circumstances, the particulars of the eligible candidates were to be forwarded to the Government.  In today's terms, it does not make sense to create a situation where a judge is urgently required to be allocated to essential court business but the Government is not provided with information that may allow it to nominate a person for appointment.<\/p> <p>We are back to an anxiety on my part to ensure there is no delay.  In such circumstances, if they arise, I believe it is important that the Government should exercise the constitutional prerogative to decide to appoint or, indeed, not to appoint a judge.  That would be the case in any event under the Constitution but that decision can only reasonably be informed by consideration of the particulars of those who have applied and, consequently, been deemed eligible.  It is proposed that amendment No. 88 revert the position to that of the Bill as published, which requires the commission to forward all the eligible names in specified circumstances.  The alternative of retaining the measure as it stands would mean the Government would face two scenarios: first, having only one or two names to work from, with no formal additional information about eligible persons who have applied; and, second, not being able to proceed where the commission could not recommend any name and the commission re-runs the competition in a potentially endless loop at quarterly intervals.  This may be in conflict with the choice requirement under the Constitution.  I would ask Senator Craughwell in particular to support me on this because he is anxious to ensure we do not have delay and he is on record as supporting due process, but a process that is not in any way frustrated by delay.<\/p> <p>I put this amendment on the basis that it would not be acceptable to have a situation where vacancies are left unfilled for a series of quarters while the commission runs repeat competitions to find people it might deem appropriate and suitable.  That is my position on amendment No. 88.  I will hear Senator Craughwell on amendment No. 88a and will then reply.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 89 is a drafting amendment to section 43 consequential on the addition to the Bill of the subsections referred to in amendment No. 88.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#GG00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 88, subsection (3) currently states:<\/p><blockquote>If the Commission cannot, in accordance with this Act, recommend to the Minister any names of persons to fill a judicial vacancy, it shall invite, through means of advertisement, the making of applications by persons to be considered for selection, that is for their being selected to be the subject of a recommendation for appointment to judicial office, at three-monthly intervals until such time as the Commission is satisfied, subject to section 35 and section 36...&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>I understand where the Minister is coming from and I have acknowledged that I have seen this happen in education, for example, where it has been almost impossible to find a suitable candidate to fill a principal's position.  I am concerned that the commission would find itself in a position, having advertised a vacancy for, say, an ordinary member of the Supreme Court, where it failed to find three suitable candidates.  I am mulling it around in my head, in particular the fact it would advertise, then advertise again in three months and then again in three months thereafter.  I wonder what our media would make of the fact.  First, there is the point the commission would have failed to find suitable applicants in one or two rounds of advertisements.  Second, let us say we go to a third advertisement, which means a period of six months, and we then find two or three people ready to make a recommendation to the Minister.  What would the media make of that judge?  The first question would be whether he or she applied for the first advertisement, whether he or she applied the second time, and whether he or she is some sort of, for want of a better description, yellow-pack judge, a judge of last resort, and that we could not find anybody until this person came along.<\/p><p>There is an inherent fairness in what the Minister is trying to do and if that is the way the Bill was originally written, I would support him on it.  However, it gives rise to difficulties in the world we currently live in, where people are subjected to the most horrendous public scrutiny, sometimes based on nothing.  We could find ourselves in a situation where the commission, having gone through the procedures, advertised the position and set out the criteria, then failed to find three names out of all the people in academia and the legal profession who are practising in any of the courts.  That would be a matter of great concern.<\/p><p>The Minister might clear up one point.  In putting the advertisement in place, the commission would be within its rights to set out certain criteria for the position as advertised, if I read the Minister right.  Could the commission include in its advertisement, shall we say, the more human traits, rather than the academic or the experiential?  We spoke here last night about a situation where a Supreme Court was weighted with more conservative judges and there would be a need to balance the situation, and we see in the United States all the time where a more liberal judge or a more conservative judge is needed to bring balance back to its Supreme Court.  Will the commission have within its rights, or will the Minister have within his or her rights when he or she puts a request to the commission, the facility to say there are, for example, too many conservative judges and we need a liberal, or that we do not have judges with sufficient expertise in criminal law or who are capable of hearing cases in the Irish language?  While the Irish language and the criminal law are more academic aspects, there is the question of the dispensation of the person being looked for with respect to their liberal or conservative views.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

Is that something that, as Minister for Justice and Equality, he would want to be able to do when we select judges?  Is it something that the procedures that would be followed by the commission would be able to put in place?  It is one area where we could find a situation that despite the fact there were a number of eminent and learned judges or barristers applying for the position, they did not fulfil the human criteria he was looking for with respect to their liberal or conservative views.

If I am correct the Minister is saying that the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality starts and stops at that point; the Minister would say, \"We have a vacancy, Mr. Chairman, set about filling that vacancy and off you go.\" <\/p> <p>Let us get back to the issue of the balance of the Judiciary and the issues to which I referred a few minutes ago with respect to the human rather than political characteristics.  I understand from where the Minister was coming when he used the term \"political\", but I tend to look at them more as human characteristics.  There are people who are of a very conservative nature in their views.  We saw that in recent referendums.  Is the commission within its rights to sit down and consider the current make-up of the Supreme Court or High Court and agree among its members that people with criminal, company law or constitutional expertise are required for a particular vacancy, and then to further classify persons as being conservative or liberal in their views?  In such a situation one would find that, in effect, the commission is tailoring the position.

I refer to a situation where the Attorney General is sitting on this commission.  The commission has advertised a position which it was not possible to fill in the first round.  There would then be a second round.  That second round could bring the position into public debate.  The media would then have a field day regarding the commission being unable to appoint anybody.  Freedom of information requests would then follow on how many applications there were.  In that scenario, the names cannot be revealed but it would be possible to find out how many candidates applied for the position.  There would then be media speculation that out of perhaps 40 people who applied, the commission could not find three.  The Minister can imagine how there would be a field day in that scenario.<\/p> <p>If it is not possible to appoint someone on a first round, and having gone through a second round, would it not be advisable that the Attorney General would be free, under his or her Article 30 constitutional role, to make a recommendation to the Cabinet based on what transpired during the selection process?  It breaks us out of the transparency I have been looking for but, at the same time, it does not allow a process to go on indefinitely without being addressed.  It would allow for the filling of the vacancy.  That is something we were talking about last night and the Minister expressed concern about leaving positions vacant.  It can be imagined how difficult the situation would be if it was not possible to find three suitable names in the first and second rounds.  There has to be a proviso of some sort in the Bill, which would allow the Government to take advice from its legal adviser to fill that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#JJ00700","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I do not wish to unduly delay the proceedings of the House.  I have listened carefully to the Senator on this issue over the past number of days.  I am minded to seek a formula that might address the issue as raised.  I have two points to make.  First, I refer to the issues of confidentiality, especially those referenced in sections 27 and 28.  In many respects, Senator McDowell was the person who, more than any other Senator, introduced the issue of confidentiality of process.  That was for good and sound reasons.  I refer to the fact that information of a sensitive and personal and professional nature should be kept within the confines of the commission and not disclosed, even in exceptional circumstances.<\/p> <p>This has also brought into focus the constitutional role and function of the Attorney General.  I am examining that and I am minded to see whether I can devise a formula that will facilitate the type of scenario as envisaged by Senator Craughwell.  As I said earlier, if we can proceed through Committee Stage, I will require a period of reflection for a number of weeks before we take Report Stage.  That would be part of the deliberative process in any event.  I will need to consult my Government colleagues for amendments to be made.  I am conscious, however, of the point raised by the Senator.  In any event, I will not bring in such a formula, if I can find one that will be to the satisfaction of the Senators, under section 43.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#JJ00800","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and appreciate what he said.  I am mindful, however, that ever since we first started to work through this Bill I have been toying with the conflict between the constitutional roles of the Government and the Attorney General.  The Bill does not necessarily usurp those roles but it seeks to control them.  For example, we have been down the road of the scenario where a Government gets three names.  It does not necessarily have to appoint any of the three people named.  It can appoint whomever it wants.  I am greatly bothered by the confidentiality issue relating to the Attorney General.  I am only in this House for four years but I have been observing politics most of my life.  Time and again, Governments refer to the advice given by the Attorney General as having led to a particular series of events or decisions made.<\/p> <p>As a former president of a trade union, I find myself slightly conflicted.  On one hand, I want there to be clear, open and transparent processes and procedures so there can be no questions and no doubts as to how a commission arrived at a decision.  I support the procedures being put in place by the Minister, albeit we are battling our way through it, and I admire his constant work with us on this.  Then there is the other side of me, however - the practical citizen side.  From that perspective, I am thinking of a situation where we find ourselves in a sort of a stopgap position.  The process has been gone through once and is now being done a second time.  There are perhaps people who were close but not close enough, or there is somebody down in the Law Library or the High Court who could fill a Supreme Court position or a position on the Court of Appeal.  <\/p> <p>The Attorney General knows that.  He or she also knows that the commission has done its work and it was just unfortunate that a person, who might be seen by the Government, the Bar and the various courts as a highly suitable, would not apply because he or she did not like the application process.   The courts might then become a political football because of what the media would make of a failure to find three names.  Rather than allow that to happen, would it not be vital, when the second round is over, regardless of the outcome, that there would be finality with respect to the appointment?  That finality would come by way of a recommendation from the Attorney General to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  He or she could then bring it to Cabinet.  <\/p> <p>There would not then be a situation of an unfilled post, media speculation and all sorts of nonsense on the social media about the state of the Judiciary, etc.  That is one of the areas where the Minister could ensure he or she does not end up in a scenario where, having gone through the process twice, he or she is still without a suitable applicant.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

We will not get the same opportunity on Report Stage.  While I greatly appreciate the Minister's willingness to work with us on it, I want assurance that we are going to find a way out.  I do not want the Judiciary to be brought into disrepute.  God knows politics gets enough of that from social media and the media in general.  We do not want members of the Judiciary to be second-guessed by whatever media one cares to look at.  We do not want TV programmes or \"Prime Time\" going through who might or might not have applied, why they might or might have been selected and why the constitutional role of the Attorney General prevents him or her from bringing making a recommendation as the legal adviser to the State.

It introduced ranking in order of preference and the carousel-type arrangement of seeking expressions of interest for the three top most judicial posts at three-monthly intervals.  I stress the carousel aspect because the process has the potential to continue for a considerable time.  There is no definitive end to the process, as Senators McDowell and Craughwell have adverted to.  I agree that the subsection should be deleted.

I addressed the House on the Bill in January 2018 and I will take this opportunity to reiterate what I said then, which was that we all wish to protect employees and ensure they receive their entitlements.  Ireland has a robust suite of employment legislation to ensure this is the case.  It was recently strengthened by the addition of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018.<\/p> <p>While I believe that, in principle, employees are entitled to keep the tips they earn and have worked for, we must distinguish in employment rights terms between matters that are the subject of specific employment rights obligations, such as wages, and matters outside the direct control of the employers, such as tips, particularly when it is intended to introduce offences into law.  Last year, I raised a number of concerns in this regard that have not been addressed in the amendments that have been tabled.<\/p> <p>We must be cognisant that legislating in this area without being fully aware of how it will impact on current practices and whether it could lead to unintended consequences could have a negative impact on employers and employees alike.  For example, the section introduces a single definition of a tip or gratuity, which includes service charge but, under the National Minimum Wage Act, tips and service charges are treated as two distinct matters dealt with differently in terms of their reckonability for the purposes of calculating the national minimum wage.  These are the type of issues that can lead to confusion and will raise questions about the workability of the Bill.<\/p> <p>In the course of the early debate on the Bill I indicated that my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, intended to request the Low Pay Commission to examine current practices on tips and report back with its findings.  The Minister has done so and has received its report, which she will publish later this month.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Pat Breen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As part of the deliberative process, the commission consulted a range of stakeholders, including the Government, political parties, trade unions and sectoral interests.  It is vitally important the commission&rsquo;s report should inform the debate on this Bill, as well as the wider debate on the approach to tipping.  For this reason, while not opposing the Bill at this Stage, the Government is reserving its position on it.  In particular, I flag the possibility that the Government may bring forward amendments on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#CCC00500","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I am not sure how that was relevant to section 2.

I also welcome the Minister of State.  We have had a tremendous interest in this Bill because it affects tens of thousands of workers in the hospitality sector.  I am delighted to welcome members and activists from the One Galway and One Cork movements, which comprise trade unionists, community groups and student union members.  I have received their letters and emails over the past several days.  They are here tonight because they are passionate about this Bill.  I also welcome some of my Dublin trade union colleagues from SIPTU.  We also have had tremendous support from Mandate and F&oacute;rsa.  All of these people have come together because this issue is pressing.  A colleague asked me as we were coming into the Chamber if there was really a problem in the sector.  There certainly is.<\/p><p>One in three workers in the hospitality sector does not receive their tips.  We know this because of extensive research carried out in Galway by the Hospitality Alliance and my former colleague, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, who deserves great credit for this.  Out of 450 inspections of establishments in the hotel and restaurant sector carried out by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in 2017, 58% involved non-compliance with employment law.  This rate is truly shocking.  There is no question the sector needs regulation.  This is just one core element.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and welcome the fact the Minister of State will not oppose the Bill at this Stage.  I offer our support in terms of working with the Department to address any of the concerns he has with definitions, as well as further amendments we could bring forward together on Report Stage.  We cannot have these workers left in the lurch for another 12 or 15 months.  It has been nine months since the Low Pay Commission was asked to report on this matter.  These workers have been waiting some time.<\/p><p>My colleague earlier asked me what is happening in the sector.  I received several emails over the past few weeks.  One worker told me that they worked in a caf&eacute; but did not receive any tips.  Throughout the summer, many bus tours, largely of Americans, visited the caf&eacute; who received a complimentary Irish coffee.  The tips were used to pay for the whiskey for the Irish coffee.<\/p><p>A second worker told me:<\/p><blockquote>I started working for an international chain of restaurants in Ireland.  When I got the job, I started my training period, during which I was told I would receive no tips.  Other members of staff told me that they were incentivised to make my training period last for as long as possible so they would get to keep my tips.  Then when I passed through training, I was told a percentage of my tips were taken for breakages.<\/blockquote> <p>A typical complaint is that 10% of tips are taken for breakages and a further 10%, 20% or 30% is taken to balance the till if there is any shortfalls at the end of night.  These are all examples which came in over the past week as to how tips are withheld.  The classic example is that the money is put towards a Christmas party.  A five-star hotel in the west offers this.  However, if a worker leaves the employment before Christmas, for any reason, he or she will not be paid a penny.  It is a deceptive means of hanging on to money.<\/p><p>All Members, regardless of party affiliation, understand the importance of the tourism industry.  Some fantastic people work in it.  Unfortunately, many of them are suffering from wage theft.  That is why this Bill is so important.  I acknowledge the broad support across the Chamber for the legislation.  I acknowledge in particular my colleague, Senator Nash, who was good enough to come out with me last Thursday in Galway to meet people on the streets ahead of Valentine's Day.  We asked those going to restaurants to ask where their tips would be going.  There is a problem in this sector.  I was on the Ivan Yates radio show this evening when a terrific chef, who owns four restaurants in Galway, came on.  The first thing he said was that there is a problem in the sector and that people&rsquo;s tips are being withheld.  This disadvantages good employers and it is unfair competition when people are pocketing tips.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Minister of State will not be opposing the Bill.  It is welcomed by our colleagues in the Gallery.  We need to work together to ensure it progresses.  If we do not, we will let everybody down.  This should not be a win for Sinn F&eacute;in but should be a win for all of us.  It will be a great way for the Seanad if we could work co-operatively on this Bill and deliver it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 is a simple technical amendment to refer a matter to an adjudicator rather than a mediator.  I thank my colleagues in the trade union movement who suggested this to tighten the legislation.  We are open to more amendments from everyone across the Chamber.  Hopefully, we all have the right interests at heart.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 3, I thank Senator Horkan for a constructive engagement on this issue earlier today, in particular regarding the concerns of the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA.  Rather than have employer involvement, it aims to have employee involvement.  We do not want employers having any further complications or bureaucracy.  We want employees to manage this process, as they already do in many establishments.  We are seeking a set of guidelines for this to happen.  Hopefully, this amendment will address one of the LVA&rsquo;s key concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#DDD00600","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thought that seeing how we are all in agreement that we would be brief on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#DDD00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome the guests to the Public Gallery and those watching elsewhere.  I commend Senator Gavan on his work on this Bill.  I did not get to speak on Second Stage.  It is excellent legislation and is at the core of the issue of how we treat workers with dignity and respect.  Employment conditions in the hospitality sector leave many workers in the sector vulnerable.  A former colleague, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, highlighted this in the Chamber many times.  Senator Gavan is doing remarkable work in ensuring this aspect of workers&rsquo; rights and fairness in the sector is secure.  I commend him on it.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 3 allows for a tronc scheme to be established by employees rather than employers.  A tronc scheme is usually managed by one designated member of staff who pools and distributes the money fairly.  The employee is independent of the employer.  A well-considered scheme gives staff up to 100% ownership of tips that are shared out in a way that is fair, transparent, free of bias and free of greed.<\/p> <p>The section allows for regulation that can aid businesses in establishing such a scheme.  The British Government is much further down the line on this issue.  In Britain, there is a wealth of public advice on how to establish tax-compliant tronc schemes.  The benefit of leaving this issue to regulation is that it allows the Department to work with the Department of Finance to establish this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would also allow employees to reach collective agreements on how staff initiatives such as pension schemes are paid for.

This should be a matter of law.  There is a demand for this issue to be made a matter of law and for this to be enforceable.<\/p> <p>We were expecting to see the Low Pay Commission's report a little earlier.

We will use the Low Pay Commission's report to inform any necessary amendments that might be required on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>Speaking directly to the amendments, the point Senator Warfield made is important.  Responsibility is given to employees to manage and oversee an agreed system for distribution and management of tips.  That takes the responsibility away from the employer, which is a good thing.  Many employers would appreciate the kind of direction and certainty that is not there at present.  Ultimately, this needs to become a matter of law in order to ensure that the rights of workers are vindicated.  There should be a right for an employee to obtain a tip that was intended for him or her.  It is a matter of importance for consumers who need clarity and certainty that, when they are out for a meal or having a drink, the tips they give end up in the pockets of the people for whom they were intended.  I have come across too many cases where tips have, in effect, been stolen by bad employers.  Most people in this Chamber agree that the playing pitch needs to be levelled and that no unfair advantage should accrue to a bad employer because he or she decides to pocket the tips to ensure that the bottom line of the business and turnover are improved and profit is supplemented.<\/p> <p>I am happy to take the advice of the Low Pay Commission on any amendments that might strengthen this Bill, make it better and more robust.

The way the language is currently phrased is quite good because it refers to what might reasonably be interpreted.  It sets the position out quite clearly.  It is not overly prescriptive in that it states that the customer intended or assumed the payment would be redistributed to the employee or employees.  The Bill contains sections whereby there is provision such that the policy of any individual establishment should be published.  That allows for any ambiguity to be cleared up.  I know the proposer of the Bill is happy to work to add further clarity as it might be needed.  There is already provision in the Bill that might be able to address those concerns in due course.<\/p> <p>It is great that we will get the report from the Low Pay Commission.  We know that many union activists were out campaigning on St. Valentine's Day for this Bill and the right for workers to access their tips.  People will travel to Ireland on St. Patrick's Day for the welcome, the relationship and the reception they get in our pubs, restaurants, cafes and all parts of the hospitality industry.  It will be unfortunate if we go into the summer without having got this Bill through.  It is good to have that report from the Low Pay Commission but it will be imperative that all of us work together, across this House and in the Lower House, to ensure that we go into the summer with real clarity.<\/p> <p>Workers in the hospitality sector have had a decrease in clarity.  I launched the task report on precarious work where there has been a lack of predictability.  This gives predictability when, unfortunately, employers have been slow to engage with the joint labour committees and some of the other areas of clarity.  The Government's legislation on banded hours will help to some degree but this is another key way to give predictability and planning and ensure there is a sense of recognition for the work that is done.<\/p> <p>Speaking specifically to amendment No. 3, this was my only concern with the Bill and I am happy to see it addressed.  When I worked in restaurants, I never made it to the position of waiter but I was a busser.  I was the water deliverer, snack provider, menu layer and all the rest.  I like that the Bill makes reference to tronc schemes.  This amendment makes it clear that it is for employee involvement.  I am sure it is the intention of the amendment, as the proposer will confirm, that it will refer to all of the relevant employees.  That is why I am keen to see that specific amendment brought in and to see benefits for all of those who are contributing.<\/p> <p>Again, tips are about the relationship between people who access services and those who provides them.  They are not petty cash.  They are not a bonus for employers.  We need to confirm that.  They are a direct relationship and a kind of contract that exists between a customer and an employee.<\/p> <p>This is a good Bill because it brings us further along the road.  I thank the Minister of State for taking it on board and I hope he will also take on board the concerns about the need to expedite its passage subsequent to his own amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#EEE01100","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I note that we are officially discussing amendments Nos. 1 and 3-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#EEE01200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#EEE01300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>-----but I think almost everybody has managed to give an entire speech about everything in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#EEE01400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":490,"content":"<p>There have been Second Stage-style speeches.

I will mention amendments Nos. 1 and 3 first, and then I will get onto the stuff everyone else was doing before they mentioned those amendments.  I have no issue with the question of adjudicators versus mediators.  I welcome amendment No. 3.  I outlined a concern to Senator Gavan earlier.  One of my nominating bodies represents Dublin publicans, namely, the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA.  I asked for its members' opinion on what was going ahead.  They do not feel there is a major problem in their particular sector.  That is what they focus on.  I am not taking anything away from the Vintner's' Federation of Ireland, VFI.  It is hard to get good staff and employers want to reward good staff.  Publicans have loads of different ways of doing it.  Some pay more to kitchen staff because they do not get tips, while others pay a lower rate to workers who get a share of the tips.  There are loads of different ways to do it.  The LVA was concerned about becoming responsible for all the tips, dealing with the rows and assigning a members of staff to deal full-time with tips, credit cards, service charges and all the other complications.  That organisation had not seen the amendments until they were published yesterday.  Its members are happier that this is the case.  They are of the view that an employer should never withhold tips in any scenario.  They are not interested in that.  I do not know what hotel chains or high-end restaurants do, but it is not what they are interested in.  They want to protect the person who earns the tip for good service.<\/p> <p>There are times when I want to give a certain person who served me a larger tip than someone else.  He or she may have been much more hospitable and better at the job than someone else.  I do not know how that can be done in a group scheme.  There are different ways of doing it.  One establishment will do it one way and a different establishment will do it another.  To each their own.  It is a voluntary tronc scheme.  It does not have to be done, and I am sure lots of people will decide that if things are working as they are in their business it does not have to change.<\/p> <p>If legislation is needed, which is clear from what Senator Gavan says, it is needed in some parts of the hospitality industry more than others.  My party's position is to support this.  We have made a submission to the Low Pay Commission and we await the publication of its report.  I have one concern.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address it at some point.  I do not know how the revenue currently deals with tips.  If arrangements became overly prescriptive, people might end up liable for pay as you earn, PAYE, universal social charge, USC, and pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions that they currently are not.  Perhaps they should declare it, but they may not be.  They might end up worse off after the scheme was introduced than before.  I know that is not Senator Gavan's intention.  That is my concern.  Perhaps the Minister of State can address how these schemes work.  Is it all done by self-declaration?  <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1 is perfectly fine.  In regard to amendment No. 3, I am glad it has changed from \"employer\" to \"employee\".  I thank Senator Gavan, former Senator, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, and all the Members who have contributed to this discussion and to getting this to the next Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#FFF00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to be able to speak on this Bill-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#FFF00600","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>We are discussing amendment No. 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#FFF00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>-----and on the amendment.

I welcome this Bill.  I also welcome the work that Senators Gavan and Nash and former Senator, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, have done on it.  This Bill is important and well worth discussing, and the amendments that have been moved are also important.  The previous speaker mentioned that the LVA would have serious concerns about being involved in tips, which most of them are not.  I believe most employers are good employers.  They encourage tips and ensure that the staff get them.  However, there are those who do not.  That is clear and Senator Gavan has made that point eloquently.  As a student, I worked in the industry myself years ago.  People have mentioned students.  This industry is an important source of income to get them through college.  There are many more people who work in the industry full time.  This is a significant part of their income.  In reply to comments on how this might be treated by Revenue, I note that the other word for a tip is a \"gratuity\".  It is, therefore, free and I hope it will remain free from the Revenue Commissioners' attention.<\/p> <p>This House has generally been good at passing Bills that make sense without any party politics.  I welcome the opportunity to support this Bill on behalf of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#FFF01800","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I am mindful of the fact that this is Committee Stage.  I hope the Leas-Chathaoirleach will allow me the opportunity to commend Senators Gavan and Warfield and former Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh on this Bill.  It can be summed up in three words: transparency, trust and fairness.  The priority is not merely justice for service sector employees, but also confidence for the customer that his or her tips go directly to the server and perhaps their extended team, not elsewhere.  Many of us have recently heard stories about what can go wrong when trust between employer and employees breaks down.  I refer to an article in<i>The Irish Times<\/i>about the Ivy restaurant in Dawson Street.  Perceived injustice weakens morale, reduces productivity and leads to high staff turnover.  This ultimately harms the employer, the employee and the customer.<\/p><p>In regard to these amendments, service sectors employees are right in seeking to safeguard their tips.  Tips are an earned reward for work well done, often under pressure, and not a privilege as some more questionable employers often make out.  We should remind ourselves, however, that tipping exists to supplement an employee's income, not to replace it.  The obligation to pay staff always remains with the employer.  We should keep in mind that upholding the human dignity of the employee need not come at the expense of the freedom of the employer.  We should seek clarity and transparency in how tips are collected and distributed, but the State should not cross the line into dictating to companies exactly how they should structure and divide tips between employees.  Every private sector enterprise is different, and a one-size-fits-all solution is not possible.  I am glad that this Bill shows an awareness of that and makes special provision for employers to share in tips if they themselves directly participated in the work , as is the case in many smaller companies. <\/p><p>How a business deals with tips should be communicated to employees before they accept job offers.  If this was the case, we could allow the market to decide what works and what does not.  We need to create a level playing field and mandate total transparency.  Managing how tips are distributed between staff is a delicate process.  It can justifiably differ from one workplace to another.  Redistribution recognises the work done by non-front of house staff, which is often unseen but nonetheless vital to the customer's experience.  Tips encourage meritocracy and teamwork and they ought to be protected.  This Bill is as modest as it is impactful.  I have no doubt that it will be appreciated by service sector workers across the country, and I look forward to the continuation of the legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#FFF02000","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":508,"content":"<p>This proposal will be welcomed by members of the unions in the Gallery, particularly the Union of Students in Ireland.

This is an important amendment and it provides an avenue for redress for employees whose rights have been breached under this legislation.  As a former trade union leader, I find it regrettable that this issue of tips could not have been resolved a long time ago through collective bargaining mechanisms.  This legislation, therefore, provides the only avenue by which workers can pursue this.  Workers need to be given statutory rights that will be upheld in court.  I hope the amendment has a strong deterrent effect on employers, which will in time lead to good practice becoming the norm rather than the exception.  The passing on of tips is a problem in many countries, yet the giving of tips is not.

This relates to a lady works in a restaurant who knows that the tips will never go to her.  The tips are left and are gathered by management.  In order to get a tip from friends when they dine in the restaurant, she must meet them surreptitiously in the bathroom.  That is the reality and this is documented.  I would like to acknowledge the role played by NUI Galway, and Dr. Deirdre Curran in particular, in gathering many of these testimonies.  This is happening today and that is why compensation is so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#GGG02000","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>It seems the Senator agreed that before Report Stage he and the Minister of State will discuss this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#GGG02100","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550658600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, line 8, to delete &ldquo;for employer involvement&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for employee involvement&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#GGG02300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550658600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related.

It seems to seek the use of existing legislative provision to define the type of employer who may participate in the distribution of tips rather than the introduction of a new definition.  However, the relevance of the associated employers definition and how it might be relevant to the types of employers, for example, sole proprietors or partners who might currently share in tips is not at all clear and, therefore, I have reservations about the proposed change in definition without such clarity as to the intention.<\/p> <p>Section 3 defines tips as though they were wages owing to the employee.  Many questions remain open.  Without a proper paper record of the tips practice, it is not clear how this can be enforced by inspectors from the WRC.  Who will keep these records?  Who will be responsible for them?  Without proper factual record keeping, what protections will be in place for the employer or employee?  If tips are to be treated as almost akin to wages should they be processed through the employer's payroll and taxed?  There are many issues as to how this Bill would operate that are not clearly enough defined or set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#GGG02700","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>The amendments are specific to owner-managers of pubs and so on.  The information can be on the menus or it might not be.  If we are going to have information put on menus, we can have a lead-in time so that places do not need to reprint menus that they had printed the previous week because of the legislation.  Many of us tip, whether it is lounge staff or someone working in a restaurant.  One will often pay for a meal by credit card and give the tip in cash so that somebody gets it.  I understand that in places where there is a compulsory service charge of 10% or 12.5% for groups over six, for instance, that often does not go to the employee, although people might think that it does.  The Minister of State or Senator Gavan might confirm my understanding that those service charges at whatever rate will end up in a pot controlled by employees to be distributed among staff one way or another, whether it is lounge staff, bar staff, chefs, waiting staff and so on.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Under this Bill, a tip, be it 10%, 12%, 15% or 20%, will end up in a pot to be controlled by employees and distributed among them, be that kitchen staff, chefs, lounge, bar and waiting staff and so on.  As already stated by Senator Reilly, the concern is that the system could become so organised it would come to the attention of Revenue and it might deem the gratuities received by each staff member to be additional income and, therefore, subject to tax.  I do not think any of us want to see a situation where this money would be subject to USC, PAYE and PRSI.  Also, the employer could be deemed liable because he or she knew this was happening within the business.  We are doing great work in terms of this Bill but we need to be careful that we do not end up doing a disservice to these people who are, by and large, generally in the lower paid sector of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019022000002#GGG02800","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550658600,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I take on board what the Minister of State said.  We have designed this Bill on existing legislation in Ontario, which has been in place now for a couple of years and no issues have no arisen.  This Bill is almost identical to that legislation.  The Minister of State said that there is a danger of us being overly prescriptive.  That is not what we want to do and I do not think we should do that.  There are two key aspects to the Bill.  First, it seeks to give legal rights to the employees in question in regard to tips and I welcome the positive commentary in this regard from across the Chamber.  We are all in agreement that this needs to happen.  Second, the Bill provides for transparency for the consumer.  I take on board Senator Horkan's comment about the need for a lead-in time in regard to this provision.  The way forward could be for the information to be provided on a notice board rather than on a menu, for example.  This issue could be easily addressed.<\/p> <p>I look forward to working with the Minister and the Department on the Bill.  There is no need to be overly prescriptive.

This seems to be particularly unfair given that the employer may have no input in the administration of the distribution of the tips.  It might even be argued that any attempted prosecution could fail on the grounds of a lack of fair procedure.
