This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Paula O&rsquo;Connor, deputy director of audit.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The RTB has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters during the course of the engagement: the landlord registration system, including the number of prosecutions; compliance of landlords with the Revenue Commissioners; inspections of housing assistance payment, HAP, properties; the RTB&rsquo;s dispute-resolution mechanism; staffing levels and retention; the RTB&rsquo;s preferred model for tenant deposits, adjudications, and European best practice; and the number of landlords leaving the market.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the RTB: Mr. Tom Dunne, chairperson; Mr. Niall Byrne, director; Mr. Bryan Kelly, head of finance, governance and risk management; and Ms Caren Gallagher, head of communications and research.

As they are within the precincts of the Parliament, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with that.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645695000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies Board, formerly the Private Residential Tenancies Board, was established in 2004 to regulate the private rental housing sector.  It has evolved since then to include the private rental, approved housing bodies and student-specific accommodation sectors.<\/p> <p>  The board&rsquo;s income in 2020 amounted to &euro;18.3 million, down from &euro;19 million in 2019.  The majority of the income comes from fees for the registration of new tenancies, which amounted to just under &euro;11.7 million, or over 60% of income in 2020.  The fees are based on flat rates per registration, and legislation provides for the board to determine the amount charged, subject to the consent of the Minister.<\/p> <p>Exchequer funding is provided to the board to cover the shortfall between income and expenditure.  Funding totalling just under &euro;6.7 million was provided to the board in respect of 2020.  This was sourced from the Vote for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The board&rsquo;s expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;18 million.<\/p> <p>  I certified the 2020 financial statements on 15 June 2021 and issued a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  One of the key functions of the board is the maintenance of a publicly searchable database of registered tenancies, which the board also relies on to underpin analysis of trends in the private rental market.  The statement on internal control presented with the financial statements discloses that difficulties had emerged with a project being undertaken by the board to develop a new management system for tenancy registrations and disputes.  Significant delays in project delivery had occurred, and there was an increase in the expected cost.  The total cost of the project was then expected to be &euro;5.2 million, approximately &euro;1.9 million or 58% higher than originally budgeted.  The board undertook a review of the project and subsequently enhanced its project oversight.<\/p> <p>  When I was signing off on the audit in June 2021, the statement on internal control stated that the board expected to bring the new case management system into use during the summer of 2021.  However, I note that the sentence about the expected project completion date does not appear in the English language version that was presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It does appear in the Irish language version.  As a matter of principle, financial statements and accompanying documents should always be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the form settled at the date of certification, except for tidying up of any typos and so on.  Therefore, the sentence should not have been removed.  We have this week received assurances from the board that no other material post-certification changes were made to the financial statements.  The representatives of the board will be in a position to provide an update on the progress made since last summer regarding the new case management system, including an update on final project cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Mr. Dunne is very welcome.

I ask the Chairman to tell me if I am getting too close to the end of that.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members, for the invitation to attend the committee today.  My name is Tom Dunne and I am the chair of the Residential Tenancies Board.  I understand that the focus of the meeting today is on the audited financial statements and on some specific aspects of the work of the Residential Tenancies Board that have been raised in advance by the committee.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied today by Mr. Niall Byrne, who was recently appointed as director and commenced his role at the end of January.  I would also like to introduce Ms Caren Gallagher, head of communications and research and Mr. Bryan Kelly, head of finance, governance and risk management.<\/p> <p>  In advance of the committee meeting today, we provided detailed briefing material for committee members, as well as our 2020 annual report, and an advance copy of our opening statement.  I hope this information was of assistance to the members.<\/p> <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board is a public body, established in 2004 under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The role of the board is to support, develop and promote a well-functioning rental housing sector in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will just list these items briefly; they can be expanded on in the opening statement members have to hand.  Under the relevant statutes, the RTB is responsible for: the operation of the national registration system; provision of an efficient and cost-effective dispute-resolution service to tenants, landlords and related third parties in these sectors; the active investigation of non-compliance with residential tenancies legislation and for the issuing of administrative sanctions, where those are justified; publishing the quarterly rent index for private rented accommodation and conducting research into the sector; providing information to landlords, tenants and the broad public on the rights and responsibilities of all parties under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.<\/p><p>We are acutely aware that the last number of years have posed significant challenges for both landlords and tenants.  The Covid-19 pandemic has created further difficulties for people in the sector, as well as for the RTB.  To inform the sector, policymakers and the general public, the RTB published detailed research reports on the rental sector during 2021, which offer a comprehensive insight into the experiences and perspectives of landlords, tenants and agents.  Among other insights, the research shows that, notwithstanding the very real challenges in the sector, 79% of tenants said their renting experience was positive and 88% of smaller landlords indicated that their experience with their current tenants was positive.  We believe this is an important fact that reflects positively on the rental sector in Ireland.  This research also showed that affordability is the key issue for tenants and that a proportion of smaller landlords, which is 26%, intend to sell a property within the next five years.<\/p><p> During 2020, the work of the RTB, was focused primarily on ensuring continuity of critical regulatory services during the pandemic and on the effective implementation of an unprecedented series of legislative measures, which continued into 2021.  One notable feature in the rental sector in 2020 was the introduction of three Acts in response to Covid-19.  The Government&rsquo;s intention with these measures was to minimise the movement of people caused by the cessation of tenancies and thereby curtail the spread of disease, while also providing protections for tenants who were financially impacted by the pandemic.  We set out details of the legislation in the opening statement.  I will not go through it again.  I am sure members are familiar with it.<\/p><p> An immediate priority for RTB was operationalising these legislative measures to ensure they worked smoothly and effectively for all.  It was imperative to ensure that landlords, tenants and wider stakeholders understood the new measures and the resulting requirements of the regulatory framework and that they were made aware of the enhanced supports and services that were made available through the RTB to assist them.  Due to the evolving nature of the pandemic and the need for supports for the rental sector, six Acts affecting the RTB were passed between 2020 and 2021.  During this unprecedented time, the RTB maintained services across all contact and communication channels despite the rapid move to remote working.  There was no disruption to the RTB&rsquo;s registration compliance capability in terms of landlords or agents registering tenancies.  Of necessity, the RTB had to postpone in-person dispute hearings but quickly established replacement mechanisms to allow hearings to resume.  Backlogs in the processing of these cases were stabilised and we are currently focussed on the recovery of our timelines.  During 2020, there were nearly 270,000 customer service contacts, more than 2,700 mediation and adjudication hearings, and more than 200 tribunal hearings.  More than 130,000 registration applications were processed.<\/p><p> As mentioned earlier by the Comptroller and Auditor General about the financial statements, I confirm an error of omission of a single sentence on page 100 of the English version of the published 2020 report.  The relevant sentence was included in the Irish language version.  This was an oversight on our part for which we apologise.  The text has now been corrected on the report as published on the RTB website and we are making arrangements to have the corrected version laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> The committee will note from the accounts that the RTB has two primary sources of operating income, as noted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The funding enables the RTB to carry out its core functions and to develop the organisation as a capable and effective public interest regulator of the sector.  Tenancy registration income in 2020 was nearly &euro;11.7 million, which represented approximately 63% of the total.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Dunne like to conclude?

We need to take all appropriate steps to fully carry out our functions in the public interest.  As a regulator that maintains a registration database, it is very important that everything that is registerable is registered, that the registers are maintained to a high standard and updated regularly and that there are ongoing efforts to maintain the integrity of the registers.  That is absolutely the intent.  The maintenance of registers in practice can be a complex matter.  It is not an easy thing to do.  To give a kind of categorical declaration with regard to a register at any point in time is probably not something I would ever be in a position to do.  Putting in place all the necessary steps, arrangements, processes and assurances to give the very highest level of assurance we can, however, is something to which I am personally very committed as the incoming director.<\/p><p> We have programmes to update the register.  At each renewal date, we write to landlords, remind them of their registration requirements and prompt them to register their properties.  If anybody out there is not registering their properties, we should be taking steps in relation to that.  We have investigative and enforcement powers in this regard.  Failure to register is a criminal offence.  We also have powers to sanction landlords for improper behaviour, and failure to register is an improper behaviour.  Some of those powers are relatively new and still being tested by the RTB but we have powers in that regard.  It is very important that we use them to the full extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#B01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Mr. Byrne but having used up some of my time addressing the omission of a sentence, I want to move on.

As Mr. Byrne knows, most licence arrangements do not come under the remit of the RTB, which means that any tenant in a licensed property does not have the same protections.  I am particularly conscious of reports we are receiving in respect of rents in exchange for sexual favours.  I raise this issue because there has been coverage of it.  Many tenants are very vulnerable in the market.  Where there is no exchange of financial consideration in contractual terms, that leaves a tenant incredibly exposed.  This should not be happening.  What measures is the RTB taking?  Technically, that could be a licence arrangement; it is not a tenancy.  What steps is the RTB taking to move that from those de facto tenancies?  They often last longer than the recommended licence periods.  What steps is the RTB taking on that issue, particularly sex for rent, and also the issue of vulnerable tenants who are in a licence arrangement that morphs into a tenancy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#C00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645695000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>There are two parts to the Deputy's question.

If such a thing were to arise in relation to a tenancy registered with the RTB then, absolutely, we would look to see what action the RTB could take in that regard.  My understanding is that generally those kinds of arrangements relate to rent-a-room type provisions, which do not fall within the registration requirements of the RTB and, as such, do not directly fall to us.<\/p> <p>  Licences are a technical matter and different from tenancy.

This goes back to the 1930s before the RTB was even created and before the Residential Tenancies Act.  When the original Landlord and Tenant Acts were brought in, obviously, there were an awful lot of attempts to get outside the Landlord and Tenant Acts by creating licences rather than leases.  The courts look very unfavourably on any attempt to try to construct an arrangement between two parties that would ordinarily be a lease or tenancy but which is purported to be a licence.  The RTB follows the courts' findings.  The disposition of adjudicators and decision makers in the RTB would be to look very closely at anything like that and conclude that a duck is a duck.

I am head of finance in the RTB.  It is a very good question.  As the Deputy knows, the nature of annual registration is that landlords will have to register tenancies every year and there is a much higher throughput of volume.  Whereas the annual registration fee for a private tenancy will be &euro;40 compared with &euro;90 currently, our sense is that we will probably triple our volume.  Simple mathematics say that should generate more income for us.  It will not allow us to be self-funding based on our current projections.  If we had a full year of annual registrations, the high-water mark might be an increase of maybe &euro;2 million in our private residential income.  As the Deputy can see from our accounts, however, we spend not too shy of &euro;20 million or &euro;21 million per year.  In the reference year, 2020, it is &euro;18 million.  We will, therefore, continue to need to draw down Exchequer funding but our anticipation is that when annual registration gets bedded in, it will increase our private income.<\/p> <p>  I will make one more remark, which is really a comment on nuance.  One thing on which we do not have a good handle will be the customer behavioural aspects associated, first, with the requirement to register annually but also the fact that the price has come from &euro;90 down to &euro;40.

We have had lots of new legislation.  Our chair made reference to six pieces of new legislation, with three each in 2021 and 2020.  The public, if you like, and ultimately the State asks a lot of us and has facilitated that with incremental funding.  As long as the mandate stays as broad as it is, and it probably even needs to broaden in other areas, I anticipate we will continue to rely on State funding for several years to come.

We look at who is operating a particular tenancy and who the landlord is in a particular case.  This is partly to do with the earlier questions about our new technology platform.  That platform is about building and supporting a much more developed capability in relation to regulation than we would have had on our previous technology platforms.

I have examined the figures the RTB gave us.  In 2005, there were 50,000 landlords, while in 2014, there were approximately 160,000.

In fact, there was a slight increase since 2014 and it remained relatively flat during that period.  Am I correct in stating that the hard information Ms Gallagher has shows that there has been no exodus since 2014 but, rather, that there has been a slight increase in the number of landlords, and that the number has tripled since 2005?

She will soon have to pay a top-up given her rent is due to increase by 37%, although admittedly it has not increased for three years.  I have seen the notice.  She is terrified of complaining to the RTB because it will mean potentially losing the tenancy.  She does not live in a rent pressure zone.

I always ask people whether they pay a top-up and the answer, 99.9% of the time, is that they do.  We seem to be powerless.

In regard to registration enforcement in respect of which the board has to resort to the courts, the brief states that a District Court summons is issued for failure to comply with a second notice and that landlords are given ample opportunity to mend their hand before a summons to court is issued.  That is fair enough.  When the matter proceeds to court, the judge tends to look more favourably on the landlord who has since rectified the issue.  On most occasions, once a landlord engages with the RTB cases are adjourned to allow the landlord to register a tenancy.  In the instance where a landlord is fully compliant, the judge can direct that the probation Act be applied or a charitable donation be made.  There is a weakness there.  If I am a landlord, I can go for years without registering or until a complaint is made.  When a complaint is made to the RTB, following non-compliance with a second notice the matter enters the legal process through the court.  As the court date approaches, I can choose to register.  At that point, the worst that will happen is the judge will apply the probation Act or ask me to make a donation to the local branch of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  That is a very weak system.  There is no stick in terms of compelling landlords to register.  That seems to be a weakness in the system in terms of enforcing registration.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the RTB has to deal with the legislation and the hand it is dealt with in that regard but there is something in this for all of us.

In regard to build-to-rent, we know that is the intended purpose of the build, but does the RTB look at those particular projects when completed from the point of view of the occupancy rate?<\/p><p>It would seem to me an obvious one, given that new properties are being held back.  There is only one intention for those and that is they will be rented.  Is that something the RTB will be doing into the future or is that within its remit?<\/p><p> Does the RTB appreciate how the housing assistance payment, HAP, works from a tenant's perspective?  The Department puts limits on the amount one spends on rent.  If one applies for HAP and the cost of rent is &euro;500 higher than is permitted, the application will be refused.  Even if the rent is a fairly small amount higher than what is permitted, the application will be refused.  That is why these top-up payments are so important.  In 2017, 28% of applicants were topping up their payments and it is likely that percentage is higher now.  What is happening to the rest of it?  Is it not being reported to Revenue?  Does the RTB intend to liaise with the Department on the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#Q01600","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645695000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked a number of questions to which I will respond briefly.

They need to be resourced.  At the moment they receive some money from the Department  I believe it is a contra item.  I note that they get a payment from the Department for it.  Virtual inspections are fantasy land.  With a virtual inspection one can get answers over the phone, or a video or whatever.  I am not too sure of the detail around how it is done.  In fact, one needs to stand in the place - and I have stood in many of them - and have a look at it and speak with the tenant.  By all means, speak also with landlord.  The person or the people who are occupying a premises know best the faults in it.  With a virtual inspection, things can always look better in photographs.  In fact, we can all look better in photographs than we look in reality, whether we are on election posters or whatever, and until one is actually face-to-face it is the same with a premises and a residence.

The Secretary General states that they were made and released without the knowledge of those involved which has led to partial statements \"that were taken out of context and also contained some factual inaccuracies\".

Can we ask for some documentary evidence of that?<\/p> <p>  On the prior adjustment, I do not know why this is addressed in this.  There is an acceptance that there is prior adjustment to the 2020 accounts.  He is saying it is in the range of &euro;10 million to &euro;100 million.  That seems to be quite a wide range.  It is strange to have addressed that at all.<\/p> <p>  The recruitment targets is an issue we will have to return to.  It may well be that we will deal with some of that with regard to, for example, mental health in the next couple of weeks.  Is the Department being set targets that it cannot meet?  Is the money being provided for targets it cannot meet?  If it cannot meet them, why not?  It may well be that there are a variety of reasons for that.  Not spending money is as big an issue where a service is required as spending money badly, so it is very much within our remit.  It is certainly something we need to take a serious look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#JJ00600","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>With regard to the mental health budget, there is obviously a huge need in that area but, in respect of capacity, a need to use it and to deliver the services where there appears to be a gap in that.  The article stated the additional money sought was reported to be &euro;10 million.  The Secretary General underlines in the letter, and seems very clear about it, that the actual sum initially sought by the HSE was &euro;35 million and I believe the final figure was &euro;37 million.  The question is whether we have, or if there is, a copy of correspondence from the HSE where the initial sum was &euro;35 million.  Perhaps we could look for that from the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  As regards the prior adjustment, one of the things when I saw this first in what was being published regarding the &euro;10 million and &euro;100 million is that it raises concerns not that we do not know the figure but that even at that point the Department or the HSE was not in a position to determine whether it was &euro;11 million or &euro;99 million.  It seems to be an awful long way apart.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the recruitment, we need to raise questions with the Department about recruitment and the issue of the budget providing for an extra 10,000.  It is the will of the Oireachtas, and the Oireachtas provided the budget.  However, we have this situation.  Is there a blockage or are there barriers?  Is the barrier here simply that the people with the skills are not available?  If they are not, the HSE and the Department of Health need to inform the Oireachtas.  Members of the Oireachtas need to know if the pipeline of trained staff is not coming through the third level institutions and so forth.  We can provide whatever money we wish but if we are unable to fill those positions with the necessary qualifications that is a problem.  The Oireachtas and obviously the Government have to take this on board and the measures to address this have to be put in place.<\/p> <p>  From what we have seen in the last fortnight in some of these revelations, if this is actually the case it would appear to confirm some of the issues many of us have been raising over a period of time now and that we must have more longer-term workforce planning in this country or we will be unable to reform the health service or provide the service.  We can supply whatever budget we wish but we will not be able to provide satisfactory services.  We should request the Department of Health to explain the challenge further.  Mr. Robert Watt mentions discussions between the Department and the HSE, and officials agreed that due to the current challenging recruitment environment 5,500 whole-time equivalents is a more achievable target for 2022.  It is worth noting that these recruitment targets are additional whole-time equivalents and do not include the replacement of existing staff who retire and leave during the year.  I noted that.  However, we need an explanation of the current challenging environment and we should seek that from the Department of Health.  Is it that we do not have the trained personnel coming through the institutions?  Is it that people who are trained are emigrating very quickly?  What percentage of them are emigrating and not taking up posts?  Also, is there problem with the posts being offered by the HSE?  Are they short-term contracts and is that the reason people choose to emigrate rather than to stay and work in these positions?  We will try to get clarity on that.<\/p> <p>  I call Deputy Devlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#JJ00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I agree with the comments of the previous speakers.

While the agreed budget was &euro;37 million, there was an additional &euro;10 million allocated.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the clarity in respect of recruitment, we know on this committee from across the country the challenge of recruitment that is faced by industry anyway, let alone in the public sector.

However, one matter which I would like to raise is a request we made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to include the remuneration of Accounting Officers in the appropriation accounts, beginning with the 2021 accounts.  We made this request in the interests of transparency and accountability and because State bodies are required to disclose similar information.  I understand that the information was requested by 11 February.  The secretariat followed up on 14 February to ask when the committee could expect a response but has not received a reply.  With the agreement of the committee, I ask the clerk to bring this matter to the Secretary General&rsquo;s attention and request that we have a response before next meeting on 10 March.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We had discussed this and agreed that it should be itemised in the accounts.  <\/p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  Next week, on 3 March we will have the final meeting in our series of housing-related meetings with Home Building Finance Ireland.  Please let the clerk know if there are any areas of particular interest arising from Home Building Finance Ireland's financial statements in order that a briefing can be requested in advance of the meeting and the witnesses can be prepared to engage on the areas of interest to the committee. <\/p> <p>  On 10 March, we will engage with the HSE regarding expenditure on mental health services, with a particular focus on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, expenditure.  Last week we agreed to request a detailed breakdown of that expenditure, as well as associated governance and oversight arrangements.  We also agreed to include expenditure in relation to the Owenacurra centre in Cork on the agenda for that meeting and briefing has been requested in that regard as well.  On the engagement with the HSE on 10 March, we had agreed that representatives of HSE estates would be present.<\/p> <p>  The week after that, 17 March, is a non-sitting week.  We had agreed to schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick on 24 March but while the president was available, the chancellor was not.  We had also sought information in relation to the Department of Health and the HSE&rsquo;s availability on that date but as neither are available, we need to agree how to proceed on 24 March. <\/p> <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, had been mentioned in the work programme in the context of the national retrofit schemes and SEAI grants.  Other bodies on the work programme include the Central Bank and Revenue Commissioners in relation to the outstanding chapter on assessment and collection of insurance compensation fund levies.  Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Body, IHRB, were also raised.  We have reviewed the last meeting with HRI with a view to drafting a report but there is little of significance that the committee has not already progressed through correspondence.  A further meeting with both bodies might provide additional material.  There is also the Department of Education and its outstanding special report on education and training boards, ETBs.  We need to confirm which we wish to go with on 24 March.  Are members happy that we would arrange a meeting with the SEAI?  It is accountable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#KK00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I want to raise an area I had mentioned before, namely, the Dublin Dental Hospital.

In this regard, if members are joining remotely, I ask them to confirm that they are on the Leinster House campus prior to commencing.<\/p> <p>  I ask anyone watching to please bear with us if there are any technical issues because some people are joining us remotely.  We will try to get any technical issues ironed out as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  Before I commence the meeting, I will outline the position on privilege.  The witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protection afforded does not apply.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I invite Mr. Brennan to give his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#B00100","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I am the vice president for welfare of USI.  I thank the Chairperson and members of the joint committee for the opportunity to participate in this round-table discussion on aligning education with the UNCRPD.  USI is the national representative body for more than 370,000 students across the island of Ireland.  A key element of USI's core mission includes protecting access to education, ensuring equal opportunities for all and working to remove barriers that prevent the pursuit of third level education.  There is an undeniable inequality in accessing third level education for students living with disabilities and this must change.  The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated these issues, but they were very much present before the pandemic and will remain in the future, unless significant action is taken to address them.<\/p> <p>  All people with disabilities have a right to good quality health, education, work and to community and family.  However, within the third level sector, many educational, financial and technological barriers exist and prevent students, including potential students, with disabilities from accessing a third level degree.  USI has worked, and will continue to work, to remove these barriers and open up third level education fully to students and people with disabilities.  However, there are some actions that can only be carried out at Government level and at Oireachtas level to ensure equity.  USI urges that at every step of this process and during the implantation of any changes and supports students with disabilities and their representatives are engaged and listened to and that the voices of students with disabilities are at the centre of everything that is done.<\/p> <p>  Advances in technology have had a significant impact on the lives and well-being of people with disabilities and as much as possible must be done to ensure that students in Ireland have access to the vast range of technological solutions that now exist to support the lives of people with disabilities.  As we enter the new post-pandemic world, it is important we do not forget the learnings of Covid-19.  It has taught us that all students need more flexibility in their study options and nowhere is this more the case than for students living with disabilities while accessing education.  While students with disabilities should be supported to have full physical access to campuses, they should also have the option to connect virtually with their studies in a blended model.  I want to emphasise that students with disabilities should have as much access to in-person classes as anyone else, but given the nature of many disabilities, including hidden disabilities, they need the flexibility of blended or online options.  Lecture content and study materials should always be available in a format that is accessible to all students.  Investment in assistive technology is also necessary in order to enable students with disabilities to thrive in the increasingly technological world in which we live.  Lecture content and recordings should have close captions or interpretative options and universal design for learning, UDL, principles should be included in all class preparations.<\/p> <p>  Along with the above measures, UDL principles should always be utilised to guide institutions in making education accessible for all.  Students who need the support of UDL should be given immediate access to it throughout the duration of their studies.  They should not be asked to jump through hoops and spend the majority of their college years asking for support to learn and to access lecture materials, but rather have it given to them.  Students with disabilities and their representatives and advocates are frustrated by the lack of standards both within institutions and across the country in terms of teaching methods, and this introduces the question of whether guidelines could be created to make access to UDL and other learning aids standard across our institutions.  Equally, training should also be provided to all academic and higher education institution, HEI, staff on their legal obligations to students with disabilities, as some students have been made to feel uncomfortable when highlighting their needs and rights in this area in regard to disclosure.<\/p> <p>  Other crucial factors that are key to ensuring proper access to third level education for students and potential students with disabilities are financial and health-related supports, including mental health and well-being.  It is vital that the higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route to education, DARE, schemes are funded adequately to support students with disabilities throughout their academic and social lives in college.  We know from numerous and varied research that people with disabilities are more likely to struggle with financial hardship and access to the required finances that should never be a barrier to a person with disabilities accessing their right to an education.  A study by the Association for Higher Education Access &amp;amp; Disability, AHEAD, showed that there has been a 200% increase in the past decade or so in the number of students disclosing disabilities within the higher education sector.  There must also be increased supports for mental health resources in institutions for students who need this support because of disability.  As USI and others have said repeatedly, there remains a huge demand for publicly funded diagnostic services for students who cannot avail of disability supports without an official diagnosis, but cannot afford to access the current private diagnostic routes.<\/p> <p>  As I said at the beginning of my statement, it is vital that students with disabilities and their representatives are involved at every step of these conversations.  Having a disability while trying to access third level education is an undeniable barrier that makes it more difficult, but it is not and should not, be impossible to access supports.  Let us consider the struggle that a person with a with a disability will face on top of the everyday pressures of being a student in third level education.  Students who need support should receive it so they can thrive academically and socially.  By doing so, we are being true to what we say when we make disability rights a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Somhairle Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brennan very much.

The presentation was excellent.  In recent weeks and months we have had different witnesses coming to present to us, and a couple of common themes are emerging, especially in terms of education and employment.  The lack of training for personnel is one theme.  Do the witnesses believe more staff need training in how to deal with disability and the provision of supports for their students?  Is there enough awareness among staff?  Are they cognisant that they may have students within their class who require supports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#B00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>There is a very good foundation within HEIs and third level institutions that staff are able to build on in terms of training but USI believes further training is required in particular to manage disclosure of disabilities and hidden disabilities.  Basic training is required to understand how to use the technology that is provided to support students.  Having an understanding of such technology will ultimately benefit the students in the long run.  There is also a need for training on the wider societal impacts disabilities can have on students, and taking those issues into account.<\/p><p>Many staff in third level will have a basic understanding of disability and how to support it.  However, the societal impact that these pressures will have on students in both a social and academic sense are often much wider than what they see in the classroom.  Having the training to manage the potential effects on mental health and well-being on top of the basic struggles of living with that disability is incredibly important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Somhairle Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Parents tell us they have to continually fight for supports for their children, beginning when they are small and right through.  As Mr. Brennan said, those supports should be available to encourage more people with disabilities to pursue further education.  The supports have to be made easily available so that people do not have to fight for something they need.  Going to third level is daunting enough for anyone.  If someone has an additional need, supports should be available.  Another matter that comes up regularly is the cost of disability, as we have just heard.  Are HEAR and DARE provided with sufficient finance?  Is there sufficient awareness of those programmes?  Could more be done to highlight them? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#C00100","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>They are fantastic programmes.  They are the reason so many students are currently in the higher education sector.  We are very grateful for that but they were implemented a long time ago.  These things need to be kept up-to-date, renewed and invested in.  We need to ensure that students are part of those conversations when we examine them and have engagement with stakeholders such as Ahead, which has done incredible work in ensuring that students are empowered to disclose their disabilities across the sector.  The programmes are fantastic but we need to keep the pressure on to make sure they keep up with how quickly the sector is changing.  We are entering this new digital era, as Mr. Brennan mentioned, in which students are having to catch up on their digital capabilities in order that they are appropriately prepared to enter the workforce.  Staff have to catch up too.  There is a lot left to do.<\/p> <p>  When students enter college under an access scheme they are often provided with the resources they need upfront.  If a student is diagnosed with a disability during his or her studies, that is another barrier because the student then has to try to re-engage with a system that is not typically set up for, say, a third year requiring disability supports.  There is a long way to go.  The schemes are a great foundation but they are a little outdated for the staff and students across the sector now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Megan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>We can take up the need to update them with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.<\/p> <p>  The national access target plan is 8%.  Is that high enough?  According to Ahead figures, it has been higher than that.  What could be done to encourage more disabled students to take up positions in third level?  I am aware of many students with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, who have gone through mainstream secondary level and sat the leaving certificate and have then gone on to a day service where their needs are not met and they regress rather than progress.  We want to see more options for everybody to progress from second level on.  This is a broad question.  What could be done to encourage more people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#C00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>There are a number of avenues.  The main thing, as we have all touched on, is that the supports available for these students needs to be constant and available.  Rather than reacting to a student inquiring about supports, the supports should be in place before the student even enters the institution.  Just the prospect of disclosing identity or disability can have a huge toll on the student.  If students know they will not have to fight, and that the fight no longer exists, they will be more likely to engage in a system.  If they know that in order to access third level, which is a basic human right, they will realistically have to fight, argue and struggle to get the supports they need, they may not want to engage in that system.  We could hardly blame them if that is the case.<\/p> <p>  It is also an issue of making it clear that the supports are available.  When I entered third level education, I was not aware of many of the supports that were available down here.  They were not talked about in schools or advertised.  I got the information in a very second hand way as I went through college.  I had many peers with similar experiences.  They were not made aware of supports for dyslexia or the more common disabilities people encounter going into third level until they were in fourth year, at which point it is far too late to benefit.<\/p> <p>  The public diagnostic services would be of great benefit to these students.  Ultimately, many students will be aware that they will require at least a review at least or some form of communication with psychiatry or something like that to get the piece of paper they need to avail of supports but they cannot access it because of the cost.  To take the case of ADHD, there are no publicly-funded ADHD services in Ireland.  They are all private and entirely inaccessible.  It costs upwards of &euro;1,000 just to access a diagnosis.  Many institutions will not support you unless you have an official diagnosis so that you cannot access those supports.  Having the supports and the basic infrastructure in place before a student even encounters the issues at third level would increase the number of students with disabilities engaging with the institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Somhairle Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>A regular review of assessments of need is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#C00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Somhairle Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>That needs to happen in the school and college.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#C00700","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>The design of the courses that we offer is incredibly important.

We have already touched on the need for the universal design for learning.  If we really reach where we need to be on that, some students may not need to access additional disability services supports.  Setting up the system to be accessible at the first point of contact is the ultimate goal.<\/p> <p>  There is a huge drop-off in postgraduate study.  We have seen a fantastic increase in students getting into levels 5 to 8, inclusive, but that immediately drops off after level 8.  We have nothing that replicates the likes of the HEAR and DARE schemes for further studies in the postgraduate area.  That is a major issue that we will need to tackle to ensure that completing a PhD is not an unachievable task for a student with a disability and that students can access them.

There was a lot of traffic but I was listening to the meeting on my way to the House in the car.  Ms O'Connor spoke about flexibility and the need for changes in the schemes to ensure that third level institutions, including universities, and further education bodies are welcoming and supportive of all their students.  She described the schemes as old and outdated.  What would be the best way to change or upgrade them to modern standards?  I am sorry if Deputy Tully raised that issue during the part of the meeting I missed.  Every week, in this room we learn more.<\/p> <p>  The importance of staff training was mentioned.  That is a huge lacuna.  I know lecturers in third level institutions who are not told what to do.  They fear they will put a foot wrong and they do not know in what way they should educate.

I apologise for jumping around many different topics but this is a very important issue.  What extra financial aids are there to navigate third level and further education for someone with additional needs.  It is outrageous there are no public clinics.  We were all poor students at some stage.  We would not have been able to afford therapies.  It is only due to the paths we take that we do not need extra therapies.  I apologise for the rambling.

We need investment in the sector as a whole so we can maintain the programmes or systems we implement.  It has been fantastic to see block funding allocated to the student assistance fund but it is not feasible in the long term.  We have to have core funding in place.  It is very important to note the institutions have full autonomy.  Many staff have autonomy as to whether or not they do training.  It is about ensuring staff are aware of how accessible this is and making it easy and not an additional workload.  It should also be accessible to postgraduate students who are teaching and guest lecturers.  It should be the minimum point of standard.  The point on empowering staff is very good.<\/p> <p>  During Covid the biggest lesson we learned was that we can do it.  We had been told for such a long time it was too difficult or expensive.  We can do it.  We have seen how well we can do it.  Of course staff were put under incredible pressure at the beginning to transfer but they did a phenomenal job.  We saw everyone graduate on time.  The ceremonies might have been delayed but everyone completed their degrees more or less in the same way as they would have.  It is a testament to the strength of the sector.  It further signals we really need to support the sector.  It is possible.<\/p> <p>  On the financial side of things, the disability services themselves need more funding.  We need more staff.  We need more occupational therapists working in higher education institutions throughout the country.  This would mean students can access the therapies in the college.  We need to fund student counselling services to ensure students do not have to look for them externally.  Year in, year out there are waiting lists of up to six to eight weeks for student counselling services.  This puts pressure on students trying to get assistance when they need it most.  It also contributes to the burnout of staff.  It is a huge issue.  We should view the entire sector as a symbiotic community because that is what it is.  There is no major separation between teacher and learner.  Everyone works together.

I wondered how I was going to get support.  As Ms O'Connor said, it is not signposted and the supports are not widely available to students.

We gave these courses the attention they needed.  We did not really keep the pressure on when we needed it most.  It was the easier thing to do.  That is simply it.  It is not that students have different capabilities or that they are not capable.  It is absolutely not.  It is just that we had that conversation and we pushed it forward and made it happen.  I am very confident we can do that with postgraduate taught and research courses in the near future.  We need to do more with the integration of further and higher education.  There are very few colleges that offer the opportunity to enter at level 5 and progress to levels 6, 7 and 8.  There are only one or two in the Dublin region.  Expanding the progression programmes is very important so that students can go at their own pace.  It is similar with part-time studies.<\/p> <p>  Lecturers cannot be expected to know everything.  We need to understand they are not miracle workers.  They have their own areas of expertise.  They need a minimum amount of awareness and training so they can teach but, at the same time, they need to be supported by the disability services in each institution.  We need to have technology officers with extensive awareness of the type of technology that is emerging that students may need.  This is very important.  Everything is changing so quickly.  There are staff in our higher education sector who have been teaching on the ground for the past 40 years.  Within a month they were expected not only to be able to give online lectures but to have all of their materials accessible in digital format.  It was an absolute scramble.  I was working at an institutional level last year.  It was a scramble but people pulled together and they did it.  People need an awful lot more support in how they can do this to ensure we keep up with the technological requirements of our culture.<\/p> <p>  On the other barriers and a magic wand, the universal design for learning is imperative.  I dream of a world where students do not necessarily have to disclose a disability to have minimum requirements.  We should have captions on lectures.  We should have part-time studies available.  All schools and departments should be completely physically accessible.  This is not the case at present.  For us not to have to make a deal out of a student with a disability or for students with a disability not to have to advocate or have to fight for what they have should be the minimum requirement in our sector.

Further education programmes are smaller and easier to access.  There is a higher level of face-to-face and one-on-one engagement with lecturers.  In larger universities students are in a room with 300 other people.  There is not the same level of intimate support that people get in smaller colleges and further education.  This means these courses are much more accessible because people are able to get their needs individually catered for rather than being another fish in a very large pond.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms O'Connor on the magic wand.  The universal design for learning is a priority.<\/p><p>Alongside that, there must be a level of destigmatisation of the discussion of disability.  One of the biggest challenges we face when engaging with students living with disability in third level is internalised stigma that they stigmatise on themselves.  There have to be further supports in that regard before empowering these students to be able to live and to show them that it is okay to not fit what is laid out for them in those criteria that they are being told to fit into.  Similar to the principle of UDL, their learning and form of education should be shaped around them rather than them shaping themselves around it, so to speak.  Finally, further funding must be put into the sector in regard to the grant schemes but also in regard to the medical card programme.  Getting a medical card should be much easier for students with disabilities than it is at present.  People should not be put in positions where they have to prove and fight to prove that they are what they say they are.  They should be believed and supported off the bat.  Having that type of support on a wider level outside of third level education is what will support them.  It is the knock-on effect of going outside in rather than inside out, so to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Somhairle Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a few issues.

However, often those structures will not be appropriate because it is not being treated on a case-by-case basis.  It is pigeonholing somebody's needs into an existing structure designed to be much more universally accessible, rather than supporting a student on an individual basis.  Therefore, while the support exists, it is equally difficult to access.  The number of students who went into third level education and who accessed supports in second level but who did not bother disclosing at third level because they knew the support was not going to support them in their way is very high.  It is important to remember that.  Ultimately, it needs to be case-by-case rather than blanket support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Somhairle Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>That is important.

First and foremost, we need to see those capital grants allocated to higher education institutions so they can build purpose-built student accommodation that is accessible for students, and so students do not have to travel far to access their education.  That is a huge issue.<\/p> <p>  Also, we spoke a lot about the universal design for learning and ensuring that it is embedded in policies as the institutions are going through this new transitional phase.

There is a long list of reasons for that.  The availability of occupational therapists is not where it needs to be in higher education institutions.  Also, even if the funding is allocated, there is a struggle to recruit these therapists.  We see a number of colleges around the country offering a course like that with a maximum student number of about 50.  However, we need to be cognisant of the fact that where we are trying to increase the student numbers we must ensure there are provisions to support them through their studies.  If we are going to increase the number of healthcare students, we need to work very closely with the Department of Health to ensure that they have appropriate placements available to them so they can meet the minimum requirements set by CORU, which is the professional regulatory body.<\/p> <p>  I have completed a nursing degree and we are seeing students flee the country after graduation for better opportunities because the payment in the sector is not what they believe is sufficient for the skills set they have and for the four years they spent in college studying.  They are being offered much better elsewhere.  We need to work closely with the Department of Health to ensure that these students and new graduates are being supported and valued, and that they are being given equitable opportunities when entering the workforce.  It is a major problem, and there are many stakeholders involved in that.  We are definitely going to see the knock-on implications of that being an unappealing or insufficient role to play in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022022400002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Megan O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Similar to Ms O'Connor, I am a psychology graduate and many of my peers have also upped and left.

Some institutions will have greater supports than others.  I studied in the Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT, which is a very small college.

In regard to inclusive housing, and I know we should not mention the housing war because it is really tough, how open are universities to properly manning and putting resources into inclusive housing?  This is not just about putting all people with disabilities into one suitable house, which is sometimes what I fear, saying that it is sorted and then forgetting about it.  How open are universities to building inclusive accommodation?  If someone has a disability, it does not mean they should be put &ldquo;over there&rdquo;.  They are part of our community; they are our brothers, sisters and friends.  Is that a big downfall of our university campuses?

I am very privileged to say that all of the purpose-built student accommodation I have lived in was accessible and there was provision for students with disabilities that was very much part of it.  For example, there would be one physically accessible bathroom for a student with a disability in a larger apartment with more regular rooms.<\/p> <p>  It is a huge issue, however.  As we saw with the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016, there was only a very brief mention of students with disabilities in that strategy.  It is something we can look for when we are asking for a new strategy for student housing to ensure that is implemented within it.<\/p> <p>  The additional costs incurred by students who are looking for appropriate forms of accommodation rules out almost all of what is actually available.  With the housing crisis as it is at the moment, it is phenomenally difficult to find somewhere.  On top of the crisis, if one has accessibility needs, such as needing ergonomic furniture, wheelchair access or anything like that, or if one needs somewhere quiet for rest breaks, somewhere that is not too far from one&rsquo;s place of study or where one needs to be during the day, those accessibility needs make it harder to find a place.  It is a huge issue.<\/p> <p>  I have never come up against resistance within an institution to doing something such as this.  They have to do this.  It has to be a priority because institutions will not be able to bring in or retain students if it does not provide accommodation.  We will see that with the international market, where international students are often a huge source of income for the higher education sector across the country.  That is not necessarily something we are in favour of, but it is the fact of the matter on the ground.

I am lucky that I am able-bodied and able to do that.  However, many of my peers were not in a position to do that and people could not access their education simply because they had nowhere to live.  Unfortunately, private purpose-built student accommodation prices out people who rely on grants and so on to live.  The Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant, HEAR, DARE and all of those will not cover the cost of living in appropriate student accommodation.

The accommodation crisis is something I have seen since I first started college and it is only getting worse.  We forget that it will ultimately impact students with disabilities much more.

The Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ, is a Belfast-based independent human rights organisation.  We are the sister organisation of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, with whom we recently held a conference in Belfast on policing reform marking 20 years of the PSNI.  A second follow-up conference is now scheduled here in Dublin for 24 March.<\/p> <p>  We also co-convene the Equality Coalition with UNISON, a network of over 100 equality NGOs and trade unions in the North.  The coalition works collectively on issues, including seeking the effective implementation of the rights-based provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements of the peace process that were to constitute safeguards over the exercise of executive and legislative power.  In fact, last year, we updated our mapping exercise documenting the status of the implementation of the principal human rights-related commitments made as part of Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements up to the New Decade, New Approach, NDNA, agreement.  We produced a &ldquo;policy asks&rdquo; document subsequent to that, mapping the reform the Equality Coalition believes is necessary for any semblance of functioning of power-sharing in the North.  Much of this involves the implementation of what are key outstanding measures from these same agreements.  That includes some duties such as the anti-poverty strategy and the Irish language strategy, which are domestic legal obligations but, nevertheless, their implementation has been obstructed to date despite the fact they originated way back in the St. Andrews Agreement in 2006.<\/p> <p>  Into 2022, we are in a situation where even the core Good Friday Agreement commitment to, and achievement of, the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, into Northern Ireland law is under threat from the UK Government.  While there were many welcome commitments within the body of NDNA, to date, far from it constituting a new approach, unfortunately, a very familiar pattern of obstructed implementation of many of its pledges has already recurred.  We feel we are being propelled back into an endless cycle of renegotiations of things that have already been committed to but whose implementation is being blocked.<\/p> <p>  For example, despite repeated commitments, no programme for government at all has been adopted during the present mandate, nor has the Irish language Act and broader NDNA language legislation been introduced, despite drafts of both being already negotiated and included in the text of NDNA.  The Irish language Act would represent long overdue progress, albeit it still falls below meeting treaty-based commitments to the Irish language entered into on the back of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>Expert working groups within the Department for Communities have also progressed a number of equality strategies committed to in NDNA, but they have not been formally adopted in the current mandate.<\/p><p> A key ask of the Equality Coalition has been the removal of the veto introduced at the time of the St. Andrews Agreement that precludes Stormont Ministers from taking \"controversial\" or \"significant\" decisions outside the framework of the programme for government and instead requires the full Northern Ireland Executive to take the decision, with a provision whereby three Ministers can also require both unionist and nationalist majorities.<\/p><p> In practice, that veto has turned on its head the intention of the Good Friday Agreement, GFA, that safeguards over the exercise of power be grounded in objective rights-based criteria.  Rather, the St. Andrews veto has been used as a way to block measures that further equality and rights.  It has had a particularly broad impact in the present mandate where there is no programme for government and has been invoked on at least half a dozen occasions by DUP Ministers.<\/p><p> This is a far contrast from the original intention of the GFA whereby safeguards on power-sharing were to be centred on the Northern Ireland bill of rights.  We welcomed that under NDNA, a process was reinitiated to take forward the bill of rights and an Assembly committee established.  It is concerning that in part its work has been impeded, not least by the non-appointment of a panel of experts to assist it.  Nevertheless, considerable expert evidence was delivered to the committee and reflected on in its report.  There is a basis now for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to take forward the bill of rights and advise government.<\/p><p> It is worth reflecting, at this juncture, on what a bill of rights could have prevented had it been in place as intended under the GFA.  It was to be the scrutiny tool for valid petitions of concern in the Assembly.  It was to guard against past abuses such as gerrymandering of housing, which resurged during previous mandates in the absence of the bill of rights.  It would have protected against discriminatory decision-making on LGBT, minority rights etc.<\/p><p> The bill of rights did not just apply to Stormont.  It would have prevented regressive actions by the UK Government.  The obvious example of that is the current UK command paper on legacy.  The plans for a UK legacy bill would shut down all meaningful investigations into conflict-related deaths, as well as introducing a Pinochet-plus amnesty.  That would have simply been unlawful, had the bill of rights recommended by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission been in place.<\/p><p> The bill of rights was to expressly contain provisions requiring legislation that ensured effective investigation into conflict-related violations of the right to life.  The current attempts by the UK to roll back the domestic application of the ECHR would have been mitigated against by the bill of rights.  From our perspective, should the UK proceed with its legacy Bill, it is imperative that the Irish Government intervenes through international and other legal mechanisms to challenge that.<\/p><p> It is also worth noting that the bill of rights, given it had provisions to prevent any differential treatment of British and Irish citizens in the North, would have precluded the type of hard Brexit pursued by the UK.  Brexit has thrown up new challenges that could also be reflected in the bill of rights, including the issues around freedom of movement in the common travel area, CTA, which was pretty much a given at the time of the GFA.  We have engaged with a joint body of work recently on this issue with a range of migrant groups led by the Derry-based North West Migrants Forum.<\/p><p> To this end, we are especially concerned that the land Border is about to be hardened for considerable groups of ethnically-diverse citizens within our Border communities on the basis of the UK&rsquo;s present Nationality and Borders Bill introducing, as it plans to, a requirements for prior electronic travel authorisations, ETAs, for non-Irish EU citizens and others who do not require UK visas.  This requirement will be backed by in-country immigration checks and criminal sanctions, which would include potential imprisonment for crossing the Border without one.  <\/p><p> This means that such persons who presently have lived cross-Border lives unhindered will face a hard border obstacle even for short local journeys they have always undertaken, including to nearest shops, school trips, social visits, work meetings etc.  There are also implications for cross-Border services, some of which, such as the areas of health are provided on a cross-Border basis.<\/p><p> This extends and mirrors the existing problem of an invisible hard border for persons who are resident one side of the Border but are visa nationals and cannot cross it without first going through the complex process of visa acquisition for what is often a short local journey that can be undertaken unhindered by almost everyone else.  A visa national lawfully resident in Derry cannot even visit beaches or hills in Donegal.  At times, families are split, as some can go on day trips where others remain trapped inside an otherwise invisible border.<\/p><p> While the UK continues to commit to no passport checks on the Border, we have been concerned for some time about selective passport checks on the southern side of the Border conducted by the Garda.  Duties that are further to the Immigration Act 2004 in this jurisdiction, to carry and produce passports when crossing the land border are disapplied to Irish and British citizens and persons exercising EU rights, but are then reapplied to other non-nationals.  Clearly, in the context of ethnic diversity, it is not possible to tell different groups of citizens apart and this differentiated system invariably leads to incidents of racial discrimination.<\/p><p> Alarmingly, this circumstance has led to a situation whereby persons of colour, including Irish citizens, can feel required to carry passports on cross-Border bus journeys, including those routes from Donegal to Dublin that transit through the North, whereby other white Irish citizens do not have to.  Whether one feels one has to carry a passport is differentiated on the basis of skin colour.  On the back of that, we have worked up a series of asks with North West Migrants Forum to seek to end those practices of passport checks and the hard border faced by particular groups of people on this island.<\/p><p> It is notable that there are relevant commitments in the Northern Ireland protocol to the Brexit withdrawal agreement that conflict with such hard borders.  Consequently, the human rights and equality commissions in the North have already called on the UK to disapply its ETA system to the land Border.  The stated objectives of the protocol to the withdrawal agreement expressly include the avoidance of a hard border.  Provisions for the freedom of movement of people are under Article 3 on the provisions for the common travel area, which defers bilaterally to the two Governments to ensure that there is no hard border.  Article 2 of the protocol also commits to non-diminution in certain GFA rights as a result of the UK&rsquo;s Brexit.  If that provision is properly interpreted in a good-faith way, it could be transformational, especially for other EU citizens in the Border counties.  The risk is, of course, that the UK will take a minimal, regressive and restrictive interpretation of that.  It is hoped Ireland and the EU will stand firm by what is in the commitments.<\/p><p> We are grateful for the opportunity to engage with the committee.

I thank them for their work, especially, their legal work with regard to legacy and the report they did was very powerful.<\/p><p> We can really see the gaps in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the effect that not introducing the bill of rights has had.  We are dealing consistently now with agreements that are not being implemented by the British Government, as well as in terms of things not happening at Stormont that have been agreed to.  How common is that and what can we do about it?  Our guests outlined the challenges in regard to the bill of rights, the expert panel and progressing that, and they spoke about the international protections from legacy.  It has been almost 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement.  To what extent have key parts of it not been implemented and successive international agreements not followed through on?<\/p><p> My next question relates to the common travel area, CTA.  We have a memorandum of understanding at the moment.  I have heard people say a stronger statutory basis is required for the CTA.  What are our guests' views on that?  Deputy Conway-Walsh, Ms Gildernew MP and I attended an all-Ireland women's forum last week, at which we heard from the human rights commissioners North and South.  There was a discussion about how the North is falling behind in respect of rights.  I would like to hear our guests' views on that too.<\/p><p> Everything they have said is bang on.  It is useful for us to have this information in such detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#C00500","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her kind words.  We are pleased the information is useful.  We are in a pretty dire situation.  Clearly, the institutions, as they stand, simply cannot deliver on equality and rights because the array of vetoes that are available to opponents of equality, who project disproportionate power in that sector, means it is almost impossible to get things progressed, even when there are commitments in existing agreements, even when there is a majority in the Assembly, even when there is a majority on the Northern Ireland Executive and even, with specific reference to the anti-poverty strategy and the Irish language strategy, where the commitments constitute binding domestic legal obligations.  We applied for a judicial review in 2015 over the failure to adopt the anti-poverty strategy and the Executive was found to have been acting unlawfully.  I do not mean to tar all the parties on the Executive with the one brush as in fact, four or five parties welcomed the ruling on the anti-poverty strategy.  Similarly, on the Irish language strategy, a judicial review was brought by Conradh na Gaeilge, representing Irish speakers.<br\/><br\/>The problem is the system commitments are being reneged on by the UK Government but we do not have the system in place that was planned for under the Good Friday Agreement.  We have a different system that has been taken in a different direction since the St. Andrews Agreement and that needs to be reviewed.  Under the St. Andrews Agreement, the veto I mentioned has been used at least six times during this mandate, namely, three times to block the progress of issues that relate to international obligations on women&rsquo;s reproductive rights and medical abortion services, twice to block the Minister of Health, Robin Swann's, Covid measures, and once to block an SDLP request to ask the UK Government for an extended Brexit deadline.<br\/><br\/>The use of that veto, however, is just the tip of the iceberg.  Many Ministers, when they are approached, might say an issue is something they are in favour of but that it is not within their power to take the decision because doing so would be controversial or significant and that, therefore, they must defer to the full Northern Ireland Executive.  In a period without an Executive and with caretaker Ministers, as will possibly be the case after the next election, we will really see how that veto can simply derail any sort of progress within power-sharing.<br\/><br\/>Another veto has been used regularly by DUP Ministers to block items going onto the agenda of discussion of the Northern Ireland Executive, including many rights-based issues, such as organ donation and welfare reform.  The effort to reform the petition of concern and return it partially to what it was under the Good Friday Agreement, which has led to the petition of concern being untenable, with none of them having been tabled during the current mandate, has simply displaced it onto other vetoes.  As for what needs to be done, we need a full-scale review involving both Governments - the Irish Government is co-guarantor of the agreement - to try to put into place the actions that were originally agreed as mechanisms under the agreement.<br\/><br\/>I might deal with the legacy question before handing over to Ms Boyd to answer the questions on the common travel area.  As the Senator will be aware, we are very alarmed by the legacy proposals.  The UK Government has not just put forward an amnesty that is worse than that which was introduced by General Pinochet but it has also ended all meaningful investigations into conflict-related deaths.  There are two areas where the Irish Government can intervene.  One issue that has caught on is something of a false narrative from the UK Government that, at face value, is quite attractive but in reality is just false.  The UK Government is trying to present its legacy package such that everything that was proposed under the Stormont House Agreement focuses on criminal justice and prosecutions, and that we need to dispense with that and look at a different truth recovery mechanism.  That is simply a false narrative in the sense that the existing mechanisms focus extensively on truth recovery, as we have seen over recent months.  There have been two Police Ombudsman reports, both of which are more than 300 pages long, with huge quantities of information recovery and detail on human rights violations.  The Ballymurphy inquest, which, again, is a truth recovery exercise, comes under the existing mechanisms.  The Stormont House Agreement focused on truth recovery with teeth, whereby there would be a body in the historical investigations unit that would have police-type powers to get to the truth and to produce family reports.  What is now proposed by the UK has none of those powers.  It is a body reliant on the disclosure of some documents and voluntary co-operation, with a veto vested in UK ministers as to what content is then delivered to families.  Countering that narrative whereby this is somehow a shift from criminal justice to information recovery is very important.<br\/><br\/>If the UK goes ahead with what is an outrageous legacy Bill, it would be up to the Government here to challenge that legally through international institutions, particularly through an interstate case brought to the European Court of Human Rights.  This has happened previously, of course, in the context of torture, in the Ireland <i>v. <\/i>United Kingdom case.  Clearly, that will be an avenue if the UK should proceed with this legacy Bill, which we know is not compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, as the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights has made clear.  That is one way the Irish Government could intervene.<br\/><br\/>Ms Boyd might comment on the CTA questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I might come in first with a couple of questions because our time is limited.  Mr. Holder outlined the international mechanisms that will be open to the Government to challenge the legacy Bill if it goes forward.

This is a bit of a hypothetical question but, if that were to happen, what would be the timeframe to go through such a complex European legal setting?<\/p> <p>  Our guests spoke about migrants crossing the Border, and I have seen that too where I come from, with Garda checks either on the Enterprise train between Dundalk and Belfast or on the side of the motorway. Do they have much experience of how often that happens?  When the CAJ is dealing with the North West Migrants Forum, it seeks to end these practices happening.  How does it go about that?  Is it a case of trying to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  How can the process be ended?  On one level, the Garda is enforcing what it believes to be the law.

The need for the common travel area to be put on a more statutory footing is something we have been raising consistently for the last few years.  The concern is that the common travel area is largely an administrative arrangement and a huge amount of the detail of it was essentially sorted by membership of the European Union.  A great deal of the intricate parts were never really put on a statutory footing and were never really dealt with properly.  One of the very predictable outcomes of Brexit was that it would expose huge gaps.  We have seen very clear commitments to the protection of the common travel area.  The Senator referred to the memorandum of understanding and the protocol clearly commits to avoiding a hard Border.  Article 3 commits to the continued functioning of the common travel area but without a clear statutory footing, we are already seeing a slow creep of changes to the common travel area which are really concerning.  The Home Office, for example, changed its guidance on checks between the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain on 2 September.  Without changing any legislation, it has now changed the guidance, which seems to state that people are required to provide identification on those journeys.  If that is the case, it is a significant alteration to how the common travel area functions.<\/p> <p>  We have also seen a slow change in language, in talking about the common travel area as something that only applies to British and Irish citizens, which is not accurate in terms of how it has functioned for many years.  It is a check-free zone that many people who are not British or Irish have also utilised and relied on.  That is really reflected in the memorandum of understanding, which focuses on the rights of British and Irish citizens.  <\/p> <p>  The electronic travel authorisation system, which Mr. Holder mentioned, which is part of the Nationality and Borders Bill, presents a fundamental change in UK immigration law that will significantly change the functioning of the common travel area.  Already, quite early in the process and despite commitments, we are seeing changes, most of which are detrimental.  If the common travel area had a statutory basis, we would have legislative clarity, which would make it easier to prevent these slow changes, like the Home Office changes which are not based on legislative change.  <\/p> <p>  I also want to mention the common travel area forum.  A huge amount is going on in that forum.  We requested the minutes and papers and got heavily redacted papers back which showed that both states are clearly very reluctant to show what is happening in that forum.  Obviously, that is where these decisions are being made.  We would argue that there must be a much stronger statutory footing for the common travel area.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding checks on buses, we have a significant amount of evidence on how often these checks are happening, mostly thanks to collaboration with an organisation called End Deportations Belfast, which has an online reporting tool which allows anyone who witnesses a check to log where it happened and what happened.  That organisation has kindly provided us with that information.  We saw a massive drop in the number of checks, which we hoped was because the policy was being examined or changed but unfortunately, we now think it was just due to Covid.  The fact that people were not travelling as much meant that, naturally, the number of checks fell.  They have started to increase again and we are also seeing a change whereby checks have started to occur at Dublin Airport among people getting on buses at the airport that are bound for Belfast.

There was not really any engagement on the actual impact of the checks on people or on the reports we have of racist and discriminatory behaviour.  We have never had any documents or information provided on how the Garda trains its officers to deal with this.  One response we got was that the Garda asks everyone to show their passport and that if British and Irish citizens feel that they are being checked unlawfully, they can show their passport.

The legislation is inherently discriminatory as it stands.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the legacy issues, the issue of potential inter-state cases is probably the primary vehicle but I would not want to guess the timeframe on this, with everything that Strasbourg has to deal with.  There would also be issues around the extent to which domestic remedies would have to be exhausted and indeed, whether the UK continues to incorporate the ECHR which, as we mentioned earlier, is under quite considerable threat.

The committee has received evidence and testimony from a wide range of individuals and groups over the past year since the British Secretary of State published the Government's command paper on dealing with legacy.  We are yet to see the legislation that will follow.  My question is about advancing and developing more, if the legislation reflects what is in the command paper, which is shutting down investigative avenues for families.  Will the representatives talk a little more about the options open to an Irish Government?  They talked about an inter-state case being a primary vehicle and UN structures just before Mr. Holder stopped speaking.  Will they focus on that again?  What role can this committee play in lobbying the Irish Government to take such an action in the event that the legislation reflects the command paper?  To Mr. Holder's knowledge, would any such challenge have the effect of staying such legislation until the particular vehicle of challenge is exhausted?  For example, if the legislation is published and stayed for a period due to a challenge, would it allow families to continue to utilise the coronial system, judicial review, civil cases, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, PONI, and, in a very small number of cases, our criminal justice system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finucane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Ever since the command paper, the way the UK has gone about developing its proposals, which it argues are not its final proposals, has been entirely in secret.  No one has had sight, outside of UK Government departments, of what changes, if any, will be made to the system.  There certainly does not seem to be any departure from the framework set out in the command paper<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the Council of Europe but I will elaborate a little more on UN mechanisms.  What is in the command paper on legacy is awful for the North, as it is for victims of the conflict and others.  There is also the risk of recurrence.  The whole point of proper transitional justice processes and accountability for what happened in the past is truth and justice but also that third limb of accountability to prevent patterns of human rights violations recurring.  If the UK proceeds with this legacy Bill, one of the problems is the impact will be felt way beyond these islands.  We have already heard, in one of the seminars organised by Ulster University, the former UN special rapporteur, Pablo de Greiff, saying something along the lines that every third-rate dictatorship would be pretty much licking its lips at the precedent that would be set by this legacy Bill.  There is a serious risk, given the UK is a permanent member of the Security Council, that the UK's proposals will end up being replicated in other parts of the world and justified.  The UK puts itself forward as a leading democracy.  There will be other countries that will seek to emulate what is in the command paper, in addition to the amnesty proposals, so it is extremely risky.<\/p> <p>  It is a subject that could be picked up by the United Nations Human Rights Council.  The UK is up for the universal periodic review process in October of this year.  We will be making submissions to that next month.  Other member states, including those the State could engage with, will be on that human rights committee.  It is another forum where the UK could be held to account.  There are other forums, such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, that could be brought to bear regarding these proposals.  There are international mechanisms out there.<\/p> <p>  On the transitional issues, given the UK does not have a written constitution and has parliamentary sovereignty and so on, it is always more difficult to see the extent to which courts would order a stay on the commencement of parts of the legacy Bill when it is found not to be convention-compatible.  One of the alarming parts about the command paper is it has an almost instant cut-off of all existing mechanisms.  Even if call-in mechanism operations, such as the work of Jon Boutcher on Operation Kenova, the work of the inquest system and the work of the Police Ombudsman, were at a very late stage of almost producing reports or pronouncing judgments they would, unfortunately, just be guillotined almost instantly, if the legislation was brought in in the manner envisaged by the command paper.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Okay.

Since Brexit, that includes EU citizens and nationalities such as Americans, Brazilians, Canadians and Australians.  In essence, people from a non-visa background, when they cross the Border into Northern Ireland, are used to not needing to apply for permission in advance.  There are no restrictions on those people entering Northern Ireland as visitors.  That has been in place for a long time.<\/p> <p>  Two groups will be affected by ETAs.  The first are those people who have been living in Border areas in the Republic of Ireland, which this system has allowed to live a very fluid cross-Border life.  If they need to pop into the nearest shop in Northern Ireland, if they have family who live in Northern Ireland or if they have someone they are caring for, they have never had to apply in advance in order to make those journeys.  A non-visa national is entering as a visitor.  It means that person is restricted in what he or she is allowed to do when he or she is in the UK.<\/p><p>First of all, it is time-limited, usually to six months.  Only permitted activities are allowed.  Most people apply for a visitor visa at some point.  It essentially means that one can do such things as visit family, tourist activities, go to see the Titanic museum, go shopping and access services.  There are also permitted work engagements under the UK visitor visa, which include things like meetings, training, interviews and so on.  It covers a huge range of activities.  Most people residing in Border areas will go up and down in a day, so the time limit has never really affected them.  These are the people who would be caught.  We are not necessarily talking about people who want to work in Northern Ireland.  They will need permission to work in the UK.  That may be through a frontier worker visa or they may need to apply for another UK work visa.  These are people doing ordinary, daily life activities.  The practical implications for people residing in the Border areas are huge.<\/p><p> There has been a push to promote all-island tourism.  People who fly into Dublin, especially Americans, Canadians and Australians, who represent a substantial number of tourists here, are used to being able to travel freely over the Border without checks.  This has been raised with the UK Government.  The Irish Government has raised it directly.  Both Stephen Farry and Baroness Margaret Ritchie raised it in the House of Commons and House of Lords.  The UK Government's response has essentially been to say that people will get used to it and also that there has always been a requirement to have the correct visa.  I do not think it is engaging with the fact that this is a fundamental change to the UK immigration system that will completely change a way of life for people here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Una Boyd","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I want to address a point from the opening statement and what Ms Boyd said in her previous answers about compatibility with the protocol, particularly with regard to Articles 1 to 3, inclusive.  Will she go into more detail on this?  This is something quite fundamental.  It goes to the heart of the British Government's bona fides with regard to adherence to the agreement that it entered into with the European Union, if it legislates in a way that is fundamentally against the first sentence of the protocol, which is that the Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct and to be protected.  The glib response that people will get used to it should not be that surprising from the current British Government.  Ms Boyd said the Irish Government and parties in Westminster have raised it.  At what level has the Irish Government raised it?  What more can it do?  What can we do as a committee?  We are here as a committee to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is respected, protected and implemented.  What can we do?  Correct me if I am wrong, but I see this as striking at the heart of the protocol and what it was designed to achieve, that is, having no hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finucane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Mr. Finucane is entirely right.  Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the protocol are involved.  One does not need to go further than the first three articles.  Article 1 of the protocol sets out its purpose, which is expressly to avoid a hard border on this island.  It is also to maintain the conditions for North-South co-operation.  EU citizens in Donegal or other Border communities are used to living a cross-Border life, perhaps taking their kids to parties after school with their school friends across the Border, they will suddenly be told that they are crossing a line.  If they do not have an electronic travel authorisation, or if they had one but it expired and they forgot about it, they could be facing up to four years in prison for having crossed the Border.  If that is not a hard border, I do not know what is.  It clearly falls within the definition of a hard border that any good faith interpretation of the protocol would provide.  UK ministers, debating the bills, claim that this is not a hard border.  The other parties to the agreement, which are the Irish Government and the EU, need to stick to the interpretation that this clearly constitutes a hard border and a breach of the protocol.<\/p> <p>  Article 3 of the protocol is the one that deals with the movement of people.  Many of the other ways to avoid a hard border relate to trade and are dealt with by numerous other articles in the protocol.  Article 3 defers to the two Governments bilaterally, rather than to the EU and the UK, to make arrangements under the auspices of the common travel area.  That must surely be read compatibly with the purposes of the protocol, which are to avoid a hard border.  That is one area where the UK is clearly in breach of its commitments.<\/p> <p>  Article 2's commitments are interesting in that this makes some of the rights of the Good Friday Agreement justiciable and enforceable in the courts for the first time.  Under Article 2, the UK is legally bound to ensure there is no diminution in certain listed Good Friday Agreement rights as a result of Brexit.  I would have liked that commitment to go further.  If the UK diminishes the same rights for other reasons, such as the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights, it hollows out the commitment not to do so for reasons relating to Brexit.  That includes rights to equality of opportunity and economic activity and rights to choose one's place of residence.  We have looked at a number of areas where the UK has diminished rights of non-Irish EU citizens.  Those include the right to vote for people who arrived after Brexit and the right to work in certain civil service occupations.<\/p> <p>  This Article 3 commitment is also relevant where the rights to socioeconomic activity and to reside on one side of the Border but to live a fluid life on both sides are clearly diminished by this new system and hard border that will be brought in by electronic travel authorisations.  It is certainly not good enough for the UK to tell people not to get caught and that it does not do passport checks on the Border.  We know that it does plenty of in-country immigration checks.  If anyone comes into contact with law enforcement over the Border, for example in a car accident, what happens?  Is people's insurance valid if they drive over the Border and have irregular status because they did not realise that they need an electronic travel authorisation, even on a road that crosses both sides of the Border?<\/p> <p>  It would be welcome if this committee could make representations to the Government and internationally about breaches of the protocol with regard to the freedom of movement of people because of these arrangements in the Nationality and Borders Bill in the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I am conscious that I only have a few minutes left.

I apologise that I missed the start of the contributions by Mr. Holder and Ms Boyd, because I was at another meeting.  I very much welcome their contributions.  The opening statements and the responses to questions from colleagues have been very enlightening.<\/p><p>This again goes back to the many times that we have discussed the non-implementation of some important aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are seeing the British Government attempt to tear up a very important part of the Stormont House Agreement with its proposal to introduce an amnesty for people who committed heinous crimes, such as leading members of state forces and paramilitary organisations.  It is deplorable that any government would put forward a suggestion to cut off all investigations.  This would ensure that there was no possibility of people getting the truth about who committed those crimes or of ever getting justice for their loved ones.  It is an awful concept that a government in a civilised world would introduce such a measure.<\/p><p>We had a debate yesterday evening.  The Cathaoirleach and I, together with many other members of the committee, participated in it.  It dealt with legacy issues and with the recent Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s report.  Three weeks prior to that, we had debates in the immediate aftermath of the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Derry.  We also had statements where we reflected on the need to ensure that legacy issues are dealt with and that the important work on reconciliation and getting to the truth is prioritised.  We all know that as time goes on, it will be more and more difficult to get through the majority of some of those heinous crimes and those awful events that happened on our island during that era. <\/p><p>It is unfortunate that a bill of rights not been introduced.  The witnesses made that point very well.  If we had the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and New Decade, New Approach, allied to the fundamental implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the issues the CAJ amplified so well would not be of concern to us today.<\/p><p>They make the point that the bill of rights would have prevented regressive actions of the British Government, including the current British Government paper on legacy.  That is true and highlights the value and importance of a bill of rights.  Apart from the contributions of the CAJ here today, I was informed on the importance of these issues when I met the North West Migrants Forum some months ago.  I, together with a number of other Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, met the group, which gave us an excellent presentation on the day-to-day issues.<\/p><p>In this Oireachtas, in plenary session, in the D&aacute;il, in the Seanad and at every committee of this House, we have discussed for years the need to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the context of Brexit.  A huge effort was made by the political system, by the Government and by the Opposition at the time, as well as by all interested parties.  We met various parliamentary groups from other member states of the European Union.  We also met many committees of the House of Commons and of the House of Lords.  All the time, there was a clear message that we need to avoid a hard Border on this island and that we need to ensure that we could go about our business as we have done in recent years.  We talked with the North West Migrants Forum about how these new proposals by the British were in conflict with all of us and with successive Governments in respect of promoting more cross-Border co-operation in health, education and tourism.  <\/p><p>I was reared in and live in a Border community.  I have had the privilege of representing Cavan-Monaghan in the Oireachtas for 30 years.  I have seen first-hand the huge change in how we go about our daily lives in the Border counties, as many other colleagues on this committee have also witnessed over the years.  Yet, we never thought that we would be going back to where there could be a hindrance or an obstacle put in the way of people crossing the Border - be it for education, accessing health services, going about social activity, playing sports, going for a day out or going to visit a family member.  It is not acceptable.  It is not what we want in this country in this day and age.  On that day when I met the North West Migrants Forum, we just talked, for instance, about how paediatric cardiac care is provided in Crumlin children&rsquo;s hospital for all of our island.  We know that the services that are provided by Altnagelvin hospital are so important for Donegal.  In my own constituency, some health services are accessed by people from Cavan-Monaghan in hospitals in Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<\/p><p>It was only three weeks ago that representatives of Cooperation and Working Together, CAWT, appeared before the committee.  We met officials from the Northern Ireland health service and from the HSE here about us intensifying co-operation in the delivery of health services.  If we are going to exclude an important part of our community, namely, people who are not Irish or British citizens but who are contributing to our society, who have integrated and who have enhanced our society in every respect or if we are going to have them treated differently, hat is not acceptable to any of us.  It is an issue that, as John Finucane MP said, has not been given the attention it needs in the political system or in the wider public.  I commend the witnesses on their work.  <\/p><p>Could I ask, as Senator McGahon did with regard to the cases that had been reported to the CAJ, in general has it been people going from a port or an airport who have been asked for identity or have been stopped by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or members of the PSNI?  Are we aware of cases involving, for example, a family where a child is attending school on a different side of the Border than where they are resident or of people going to access health services or about their daily business?  I am thinking about those who have been living here for some time, who may have settled here, who are working and who are contributing to society.  One member of the household may be working in this State, while another member of the same household might be working in Northern Ireland, or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I am thinking of this in regards to the provision of and access to services.  <\/p><p>I commend Mr. Holder and Ms Boyd on their work.  I also take the opportunity once again to commend the work of the North West Migrants Forum.  Have our guests come across instances of people who have been living here for some time and who have been asked to produce identification or whatever?  I would see that as being reprehensible and as going against everything that has been fought for and worked extremely hard for by many people for decades to achieve.  It is going in the opposite direction of the benefits from the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and New Decade, New Approach.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#H00400","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Before our guests answer, if any other members of the Deputy&rsquo;s party present and who wish to contribute, in whatever order, there are 11 or 12 minutes left in the slot.

Our focus at CAJ tends always to be on the policy, the legislation and what can be changed.  We know what the issues are, but it is powerful to hear some of the human stories of how it affects people's daily lives, how it splits families up and so forth.  Ms Boyd might wish to elaborate, but the short answer is that we do know persons who are in the circumstances the Deputy outlined.  I have come across Irish citizens who live in the north west but who will not get buses down to Dublin because of the indignity of being singled out because of their skin colour and being expected to show a passport that they have no reason, by law, to be carrying by virtue of being Irish citizens.  Instead they either get a bus down to Sligo or drive down or avoid making that journey because they are singled out.<\/p> <p>  For all the talk about hard borders and the need to avoid a hard border with Brexit, the Deputy hit the nail on the head - there is an existing hard border for some groups of citizens.  Partly, it is through these passport checks.  The way we see it is that one either has passport checks on a border or one does not.  Nobody wants blanket passport checks on the Border here.  That would constitute a hard border.  However, this halfway house of having legislation that expects some people to carry passports, and not others, and the inevitable racial discrimination that this leads to is quite shocking.  It affects British and Irish citizens who are perceived not to be British or Irish citizens on the basis of skin colour.  While there is a lot the UK could do in terms of not proceeding with this, it is unilaterally within the gift of the Irish Government and the Oireachtas to end it through a simple amendment to the Immigration Acts.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of somebody who is essentially a visa national, that is, somebody who is lawfully resident and, as the Deputy described, has lived for years in Derry, Dungannon, Newry or somewhere else and who simply cannot cross the Border without going through the very expensive and complex process of visa acquisition.  That is very much within the gift of the authorities here to change with a proposal or something that would essentially allow persons in that situation, lawfully resident in the North either permanently or temporarily, to cross the Border as visitors without needing to require advance permission.  That is not going the full step of full free movement to work and so forth, but merely a condition that would be brought in to allow people to cross the Border as part of their daily lives, for example, the family who live in Derry and want to visit a beach in Donegal but who currently cannot or some members of the family cannot do so, or they cannot go to a child's birthday party on the other side.  That appears to be a very simple thing.  It is not even an immigration issue in the sense that we are talking about people who are already here on this island.  Ms Boyd might wish to elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  We have come across the situation where, in terms of recent anecdotal reports, garda&iacute; got on buses outside Dublin Airport and asked passengers for passports.  Given that whoever got off the aeroplane has already been through immigration control, that is quite clearly An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na implementing British immigration controls in the State because it is targeting people who it believes will be travelling on to the North.  That is essentially implementing the UK's hostile environment policies, which is an extremely worrying development.  The PSNI, thankfully, does not have an immigration-specific portfolio and remit in the North.  The Home Office Border Force and immigration enforcement officers have engaged in this activity.  As well as this being a North-South issue it is also a east-west problem, with Home Office immigration officers stopping people on domestic journeys at ports and borders in the North, quite often on the basis of skin colour or other ethnic attributes, and expecting people to display passports and the like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":630,"content":"<p>On that point, the Department of Justice has published reports on trafficking of human beings in Ireland.

My understanding is that the UK's Nationality and Borders Bill is due before the House of Lords for completion by the end of this month.  If that is passed, it would lead to further amendments to the British Immigration Act, if I am correct.

The United Nations anti-racism committee has recorded some concerns about racial profiling in Garda operations.  To go back to the community level, and to be openly clear about what we are saying, it is very much the lived experience of people of colour in Border communities that this is the basis on which they are singled out and on which they are assumed not to be British or Irish citizens and therefore required to produce a passport on the cross-Border buses.  It is an inevitable consequence of legislation that differentiates different groups of people as to whether they are or are not required to carry and produce passports on those cross-Border journeys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":633,"content":"<p>We should invite representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice, if that is agreed.

Most the things about the ETA issue have probably been said.  I will make a few points to which Mr. Holder or Ms Boyd may wish to respond.  I have been assured by the Department of Foreign Affairs that it is very much seized of this issue and that it is a priority for it.  I think representations have been made to the Home Office.  It is still a work in progress.  I fear the Bill will go through Parliament.  The House of Lords is largely a revising chamber.  It is very difficult for it to overturn and defeat legislation.  As for the amendments, we expect the Bill to come back to the House of Commons sometime in March and we will keep pushing in that regard.  It remains to be seen whether Margaret Ritchie's re-tabling of the amendment will get through on Report Stage in the House of Lords, but that will probably be the trigger for any pushback in the House of Commons.  I suspect, however, that with an easy majority, the Conservative Party will ram the Bill through and maybe ping-pong with the House of Lords for a few sessions but, ultimately, push ahead with this.<\/p> <p>  If I may add to the potential implications of this one additional implication that has been drawn to my attention in respect of healthcare, if we end up with some good cross-Border collaboration on healthcare allocation, we could see ambulances from Northern Ireland picking up people in southern Ireland and taking them to hospitals in Northern Ireland because they are the closest available.  Those patients will have no opportunity whatsoever to apply for any ETA in that regard, given their situation.  That is just one more aspect to add to this.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to ask about the common travel area.  Concerns have been raised by, I think, the committee and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission about the fact that the CTA is still essentially a mix of some legislation but largely conventions held by the two Governments.  We have the revised memorandum of understanding but do the witnesses think there is a case for putting the CTA on a formal treaty basis between the UK and Ireland, properly embedding the rights contained therein and providing people with much greater surety in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Finally, regarding the legacy issue, do the witnesses have any comment as to what may be holding up the current Bill?  Not that we are in any rush to see bad legislation come forward.  There is the practical issue that we are expecting a Queen's speech in the House of Commons soon and a new session of Parliament.  There seems to be some tension within the UK Government on the issue of compelling people to co-operate with any so-called truth recovery body put in place.  I appreciate that that falls far short of Article 2 compliance, but do the witnesses have any comment to make on that controversy in its very limited sense?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I will start with the legacy issues and then move on to the common travel area.<br\/><br\/>The amount of secrecy over what is going on with the legacy Bill is very unorthodox.  The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland has already found that the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, has breached its equality scheme because of the way it handled the initial written ministerial statement and has not produced its equality impact assessment.  There has been no proper public consultation at all on what is going on, which has happened behind closed doors.  Our main source of information on this is what seems to be periodically leaked to certain UK newspapers, particularly <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i>.  The issue Dr. Farry has raised seems to be a disagreement between the Northern Ireland Office and the Ministry of Defence, MOD, about introducing some level of compellability.  Let us be clear that the legacy body that has been proposed is the most toothless type of legacy body, with much fewer powers than what was proposed in the Stormont House Agreement or the existing legacy bodies as part of the package of measures.  It seems the NIO was for imposing fines for non-co-operation.  It seems the MOD was somehow saying that that would be unfair on British soldiers because if they refused to co-operate they would get fines but republicans could just move to the Republic and would therefore be out of the reach of fines.  That seemed a very odd position for a UK Government department to take because, obviously, its soldiers would not be fined if they just co-operated with the legacy body rather than refusing to co-operate with it.  Also, it seemed a little odd to suggest that it was very easy for anyone questioned as a non-state actor just to somehow move house to get out of receiving a fine.  That seemed a very strange position.  The MOD was potentially talking about a different model of making the amnesty conditional, but there is no clarity as to what the detail of that was.  We all know that all these discussions about powers of compellability were held for years during the development of the package that became the Stormont House Agreement.  All the answers to what proper powers the body should have and what levels of immunity could be granted are within the two institutions that were developed, namely, the historical investigations unit, which would have full police powers, and the independent commission for information retrieval, which would protect immunity for protected statements but without an amnesty attached.  The solutions to these problems, therefore, are to go back to what was negotiated and agreed before the UK walked away from that.<br\/><br\/>As for the common travel area, we have taken a position that there should certainly be a treaty.  We are very much supportive of the human rights commissions' assessment of and model for this.  We are aware of the memorandum of understanding that was drafted.  Bits of it have found their way into a legally binding framework on social security.  One of the problems with that is that the post-Brexit direction of travel is to restrict the reciprocal elements of the common travel area that were never really part of the common travel area but have now been put as such just for British and Irish citizens.  As that will create its own problems, this needs to be something that accounts for the whole population.<br\/><br\/>The healthcare issue Dr. Farry quite rightly raised is also an existing problem for visa nationals.  Obviously, I do not want to go into individual cases but they do exist.  I refer to the existing North-South, cross-Border arrangements on children's heart services, the North West Cancer Centre and so on, whereby people or family members have not been able to travel or to avail of those services urgently because of visa requirements.  That is very much an existing problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Holder.  A lot of what I had intended to ask him and Ms Boyd has been asked and addressed already, so I will not rehearse those issues.  It was important that the very first contribution from Senator Currie referred to the failure of the British Government and certain parties to implement agreements.  There are also issues of concern regarding the Irish Government and its commitment to agreements.  Even as early as a few months ago this committee engaged with representatives of former political prisoners who have concerns about employment opportunities in this jurisdiction and about discrimination as a result.<\/p><p>We know the Good Friday Agreement calls for the full reintegration of those with political convictions.  We have heard overt public statements from senior figures in the Government up to the Taoiseach referring to provisions of the Good Friday Agreement as being divisive and contentious.  I refer specifically the provision for a border poll.  Across the board, there are responsibilities to adhere to the spirit, word and letter of the agreement.  <\/p><p> Like other colleagues, I have engaged with Ms Boyd and Mr. Holder on the issue of checks on buses before, raised it in the Seanad and, when I was a member of the justice committee, with the Garda Commissioner.  I have been on the bus travelling to this institution and have seen examples of some of the concerns expressed by people from ethnic minority backgrounds and by people of colour who are Irish or British citizens and who have been checked.  It is something I am alert to.  The Chair's suggestion that we engage with the Department and Minister for Justice was a helpful one.  Because of the cross-cutting issue of the ETA and the travel waiver, we need to go broader than that.  There are immigration and policing issues, as well as issues regarding health and education, as Dr. Farry noted, including further and higher education, for students travelling north and south.<\/p><p> There are more general issues for the Department of Foreign Affairs, as outlined by Mr. Holder and Ms Boyd.  We have a bit of work to do as a committee.  This goes to the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, stability and peace on the island and all the issues raised concerning the protocol and the common travel area.  I would hate to see it left, because of the cross-cutting nature of it, to us alone when there are responsibilities for Departments to be alert to this and work to address it.  The committee should engage with the British Home Secretary, Priti Patel, and contact her to express our concerns.  We should invite other Ministers and other committees.  It is important that the relevant joint committees and their members are alert to this issue.  I will go away and work on this but I think there would probably be support and agreement across parties if, now we are reopening and able to avail of the audiovisual room, we on a cross-party basis invite the CAJ, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other organisations to come into the Oireachtas to present to a broader audience, hopefully, on this issue.<\/p><p> Senator Currie and I, along with other colleagues, will attend the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, on Monday.  The time has passed for us to table issues to be debated at that but we will raise the issue with colleagues from the House of Lords, the House of Commons and political parties across Britain and beyond.  <\/p><p> The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, recently met the British Home Secretary.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, told me in the Seanad that this issue had been raised but that was really it.  I am concerned that this is not on the radar of the Government in the way it should be.  There is substantial work for us to do as a committee, as parties and as individual parliamentarians.  Is there anything beyond what the witnesses have suggested that they think we should do?  Those are my suggestions that I offer up.<\/p><p> I raised the issue in September 2019 with the Garda Commissioner.  Similar to the witnesses, I had difficulty getting any detail around it.  In the course of a Commencement matter debate I had in the Seanad with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, no statistics were available in the immediate run-up to the referendum on Brexit or post Brexit.  I have a concern that this is not being monitored in the way it should.  It is vital that we pursue those statistics and scrutinise them in the way the Chair suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#K00600","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and the papers they submitted beforehand.

How important is a bill of rights in a society coming out of conflict?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Holder referred to the \"opponents of equality\".  It is staggering that anybody would oppose an anti-poverty strategy.  We got rid of the Combat Poverty Agency here, which was a disastrous mistake, if it was a mistake.  An anti-poverty strategy is so important for the people that the political parties across the board propose to represent.  It is important to see who the opponents are.

He made valuable suggestions about what the committee can do and I would like to give him an opportunity to give us more concrete guidance on that.

To use the Deputy's example of the anti-poverty strategy, four of the five parties in the Northern Ireland Executive to various levels welcomed the judicial review that found it acted unlawfully in not adopting it.  Only the DUP opposed it.  In the engagements we had on that, the objection of the DUP seemed to be that the anti-poverty strategy is specified in the St. Andrews Agreement and the legislation as a strategy to tackle poverty on the basis of objective need.  There is far more objective need among the Catholic nationalist community, where levels of poverty are far higher than among the Protestant unionist community by whichever measure one wishes to take.  Area-based measures may involve more resources rightly going to people on the basis of objective need.<\/p><p>If we want to instead have a system where resources are allocated on the basis of clientelism or sectarian parity, then a system rightly focusing on objective need is not one people will subscribe to.  The objective need issue was the particular barrier in respect of the anti-poverty strategy.  It is the Stormont House Agreement the UK has reneged on rather than the anti-poverty strategy.<\/p><p> It is right that we look at the bill of rights as a safeguard over power-sharing in the same way a constitution is in almost every other jurisdiction.  The architects of the Good Friday Agreement had objective rights-based safeguards in mind.  There are many different models around the world.  Some countries have guardian councils that veto laws on the basis of ultra-conservative religious moral views.  I do not think that is what the architects of the Good Friday Agreement had in mind.  However, that is ultimately what we have ended up with because we have a situation where the St. Andrews veto is used to veto a consultation on same-sex marriage equality, to block provisions relating to women's reproductive rights, and to block minoritised language rights for the Irish-speaking community.  We have ended up with a system of political vetoes that amplifies the power of the opponents of equality in the sense that even with a majority on the Executive and in the Assembly, and a legal obligation in the case of the anti-poverty strategy, a particular commitment cannot be got over the line.<\/p><p> The bill of rights was meant to constrain power.  We have given evidence to the bill of rights committee where we went into some detail about things that could have been prevented.  One obvious example is the L&iacute;ofa decision, which was instrumental in the collapse of Stormont.  That collapse was not just about the renewable heat incentive scheme, but a much broader pattern of non-implementation and obstruction of rights-based commitments.  There is no freestanding right at present to non-discrimination on the basis of language anywhere outside where it is parasitic to ECHR rights through the Human Rights Act, but a case would have been pretty straightforward on the grounds that a bill of rights would have a freestanding right to non-discrimination against Irish speakers.  It would have been pretty easy to challenge that decision.  The gay blood ban introduced by a DUP Minister is another example.  Again, there were attempts to judicially review that, but a bill of rights being in place would have made that type of policymaking much easier to challenge.  <\/p><p> We saw a re-emergence, especially in north Belfast, of patterns of gerrymandering in housing provision.  There was one in the Department for Social Development, again, under a DUP Minister.  There were particular projects, such as Building Successful Communities, a resourcing project, in which the criteria for where new houses would be built seemed a little odd.  It did not include objective housing need, which is what you would expect things to be based on.  It included areas with a high number of vacant properties or areas that were in proximity to areas of housing need, i.e. on the other side of the peace line.  At the same time, there were objections to houses being built in particular areas on the grounds there had to be community consensus before houses were built.  This was in the context of \"you can't build houses there because Catholics will live in them\", which is where much higher objective housing need is, and until there is community consensus.<\/p><p> In the anti-racism context, imagine if the most objective needs for housing somewhere in England are among an ethnic minority population, yet there are objections to housing being built on the basis of objective need and an idea that those houses cannot be built until white people agree.  That kind of thing, and we have documented this, was happening.  That would never have got past the right to housing in a bill of rights, which is not about the myth of the state having to provide every single person with a house.  That is not it.  It is about preventing extreme actions by Ministers and extreme legislative acts that interfere with the right to housing.  That could not have happened, and could have been easily challenged, if a bill of rights was in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Is there a toleration from both Governments, as guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, of the bill of rights part of that agreement not being implemented?

That is very important because otherwise it would not bind any Act of the British Government.  It is not just Stormont that could breach the bill of rights; it is the British Government.  The legacy example is the obvious one.  The excuse at present is that the British Government has made up a prerequisite of either all-party or cross-party consensus on a bill of rights.  There is, bar the DUP, consensus on a bill of rights across most of the other parties.  There is certainly cross-community consensus among Protestants, Catholics, unionists and nationalists.   Every poll that has ever been done on a bill of rights has demonstrably shown that, but the UK Government has, in effect, made up a prerequisite that it will not move until there is consensus on the content of a bill of rights.  In effect, this hands to opponents of equality a veto over a bill of rights actually being in place.<\/p> <p>  Of course, that is not contained anywhere in the Good Friday Agreement, which is very clear about the advice on the content of a bill of rights, because everyone knew there was never going to be consensus on that just as there was never going to be consensus on policing reform - it was something that had to be done as part of the settlement.  Instead, the advice on what the content is has been deferred to an independent public body.  The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is to provide the advice on the content of the bill of rights, but that commission finds itself in a difficult position at present.  The UN has not renewed its UN status as was expected because, as a national human rights institution, the commission needs to abide by a certain set of rules regarding its powers and independence that have not been met.  I should stress this is not because of anything the Human Rights Commission has done but what the Northern Ireland Office has done, particularly in respect of cutting the commission's funding to the extent that it cannot discharge many of its core functions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":650,"content":"<p>It is the same difference.

Mr. Holder's work is appreciated, in particular on legacy and cross-Border issues, which will potentially worsen with the introduction of the ETA in a couple of years.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on a different issue, as part of our wide look at the Good Friday Agreement and its operations and roots, the committee will look into the effectiveness of the Stormont institutions, in particular how the Assembly is functioning.  Obviously that work might become more urgent if the Assembly is not promptly re-established after the May election.  The bill of rights would be a fundamental change that could pre-emptively address many of the issues that get bogged down in the Assembly or would at least provide a pathway.  Mr. Holder has also drawn attention to the pre-emptive veto, which has become the new petition of concern, as something that is creating considerable dysfunction and delay by allowing parties - mainly one party, if we are honest - to veto measures that are deemed cross-cutting or substantial.  It is one of the degradations inserted into the St. Andrews Agreement which have contributed to the terrible governance.  Has the CAJ looked at how that particular issue might be addressed in any review of the ugly scaffolding, as it were?  Are there other operational mechanisms that need to be tweaked or refreshed in future assemblies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022022400002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645660800,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Yes, we have looked at that.  We provided the mapping exercise to the committee, which goes through all the agreements and the unimplemented commitments.  We see the goal ultimately of any future review process - and it may well come in the next endless cycle of renegotiation after the assembly election - as getting what has already been agreed implemented.  There are certain areas where we see change to return largely to what was envisaged within the Good Friday Agreement.  Primary among these is the removal of the veto that was introduced at St. Andrews over controversial and significant mandates.  It turns the intention of the Good Friday Agreement on its head.  It is a subjective tool to block rights-based policies and that is what it is used for.<\/p> <p>  A second issue that we have flagged is the power vested in the First Minister or deputy First Minister unfairly to block items going on the agenda of the Northern Ireland Executive.  We have looked at that in detail as well.  To give some examples from the current mandate, a submission to the Council of Europe treaty body on the Irish and Ulster Scots strategies was blocked from the Executive agenda and the Irish language strategy does not appear to have been progressed by virtue of being blocked from the agenda.  As members may know, the draft budget in December 2020 was blocked for a number of months from the agenda of the Executive.  Back in June 2021, the Minister for Communities at the time stated that legislation to close loopholes in the agenda had been blocked by the DUP 17 times.  This was at the time the Minister of Health, Mr. Robin Swann, called out that opt-out organ donation legislation was being blocked from the agenda.  The Minister of Justice, Ms Naomi Long, also called out that measures around upskirting and strengthening protections for victims of sexual abuse had also been blocked from the agenda.  It was only after high-profile public intervention and outrage that those measures were given any sort of passage, albeit the latter was in reduced form.  <\/p> <p>  The huge implications of the St. Andrews veto will come too late.  We have a situation where Ministers cannot take any decision that is significant or controversial, which applies to almost any decision at the moment, given that there is no programme for government.  If there is a programme for government, it puts the St. Andrews veto beyond its scope.  It is obviously a very clever move simply to veto the programme for government.  Therefore, the veto can be used on everything else.  We end up in a situation whereby the body that is supposed to take the decisions that individual Ministers cannot take on the grounds that they are deemed significant or controversial - meaning Ministers can only take insignificant and uncontroversial decisions - does not exist because that body is the Northern Ireland Executive.  It may well not exist after the next Assembly election for some considerable period of time.  We could end up with something more than lame-duck Ministers, namely, Ministers who will not be able to progress any of the issues.<\/p> <p>  We have also looked at other issues as the Equality Coalition.  We do not believe the reforms to the petition of concern went far enough.  We would like what the majority wanted at the time of New Decade, New Approach, namely, for the human rights and equality commissions to have an adjudicatory role based on rights-based criteria, that is, the European Convention on Human Rights and the bill of rights when the latter is implemented.  Things cannot really function until that happens.<\/p> <p>  The St. Andrews veto in the Executive needs to be knocked out but there also needs to be a broader review of cross-community designations, in particular given the growth to ensure that rights-based power-sharing involves participation across the community.  At the moment, it is not based on community background at all but on unionist and nationalist traditional political designations.  That is not to say we want to get rid of the system completely.  We want a system obviously that prevents abuses of power by larger blocs but we believe that issue needs to be looked at.  <\/p> <p>  A further technical issue is the good relations duty.  While it was not in the Good Friday Agreement, it was added on to the equality idea as an appendage.  It has been the mechanism used to wreck and block a number of equality policies.  It has been heavily criticised by Council of Europe bodies and we believe it needs to be defined to ensure it is actually about tackling prejudice and promoting understanding.<\/p><p>That is rather than just being a veto over what is politically contentious, including some of the matters I raised earlier around housing, whereby it is seen as bad for good relations to put houses in particular areas because it is politically contentious.  We are dealing with a case where Belfast City Council, after much campaigning and work, is adopting a much more progressive model for bilingual street signage in line with international standards.  Nevertheless, its consultation is proposing an equality screening exercise to look at good relations impacts on each and every bilingual sign proposal.  That seems to be code for not putting up such signage where it is politically contentious.<\/p><p> Again, that is not an example of objective, rights-based criteria but rather vesting a veto in the opponents of rights and equality that can block and obstruct things agreed many years ago.  The Good Friday Agreement, in such an example, was meant to mark a reset in the relationship between the Irish-speaking community and the state and move away from the predecessor English-only policies.  It is ironic some of the mechanisms that were to underpin the Good Friday Agreement have been implemented in the wrong way, such as with the addition of the good relations duty.

I very much welcome this opportunity to meet them to discuss the Revised Estimates for 2022 &mdash; Vote 38, Department of Health.  I am delighted to be joined by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Butler.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2021 saw an unprecedented allocation of over &euro;4 billion in additional funding for health.  This funded Covid-19 responses, maintaining the existing level of service, but, critically, &euro;1.16 billion of this funded vital capacity and reform measures.  This included unprecedented numbers of additional beds, workforce expansion, home care hours and investments in national strategies.  We are all aware that 2021 was a difficult year, with significant impacts from Covid and the need to deliver the vaccination programme.  This meant that not all of these new measures could be delivered in 2021.<\/p> <p>  We estimate that approximately &euro;650 million of the &euro;1.16 billion was spent in 2021.  However, I am very pleased that, as we enter a new phase in the Covid-19 pandemic and plan to scale back our emergency Covid-19 expenditure, the Government has made the full amount of funding available again this year, together with &euro;319 million in additional funding for new measures.  This means there is a further expansion of over &euro;500 million from 2021 new measures still to be delivered in 2022.  This brings the total available for additional capacity and reform for this year to over &euro;800 million.  This will fund an expansion of our workforce of up to 10,000 staff, over 300 additional acute beds and 3 million additional home care hours.  It will also fund the full roll-out of the enhanced community care teams to move delivery of care out of hospital settings into the community.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned previously my three priorities, which are also those of the Government, in delivering universal healthcare.  These are improving access for patients, improving outcomes for patients and improving affordability for patients.  This Revised Estimate continues the work done in delivering on all three.<\/p> <p>  On patient access, the aim is to address waiting lists by allocating an additional &euro;200 million to the HSE and an additional &euro;50 to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, creating an access-to-care fund for this year of &euro;350 million.  I am providing funding for additional critical care capacity, with funding to open 19 additional critical care beds.  This is on top of the substantial funding of &euro;426 million provided in 2021 for overall bed capacity.<\/p> <p>  With regard to better outcomes for patients, the level of funding provided will enable the advancement of a number of priorities in 2022, including prioritising funding for women's health.<\/p><p>The level of funding provided will enable the advancement of a number of priorities this year, including prioritising funding for women&rsquo;s health.<\/p><p> I have allocated an unprecedented &euro;47 million towards investments in women&rsquo;s health this year.  This will allow us to introduce a number of very important measures, including free contraception, initially for women aged 17 to 25 years; and increased investment in a new approach to menopause care.  Some &euro;10 million has been provided to the women&rsquo;s health fund for new targeted projects, such as initiatives to address period poverty.  National strategies will be implemented that impact on women&rsquo;s health with additional funding for maternity, obstetrics, gynaecology services and perinatal genetics, as well as funding in cancer, drugs and mental health.<\/p><p> I was delighted to announce only last week a new plan to reduce waiting times for children and adolescents waiting for orthopaedic care.  This includes, of course, children waiting for intervention and help on scoliosis and spina bifida.  Funding for the continued implementation of other national strategies is also included this year, including for the cancer strategy, the National Ambulance Service strategic plan and the trauma strategy and for the paediatric model of care, for organ donation and transplant services and for the social care strategies, including in the area of dementia and palliative care.  It also funds the introduction of new regulations and legislation to expand the remit of HIQA, the roll-out of InterRAI assessments in nursing homes and more.<\/p><p> In terms of affordability for patients, budget 2022 responds strongly to the programme for Government commitment to introduce more care in the community and to make accessing services more affordable.  This will reduce our dependence on the hospital-centric model of care.<\/p><p> In addition to the strategies mentioned above, I will provide for the extension of free GP care for children aged six and seven.  This will benefit approximately 80,000 additional children this year.  We will reduce the drug payment scheme threshold from &euro;114 to &euro;80, which will benefit approximately 70,000 people.<\/p><p> Actions will also be taken on a phased basis to reduce the financial burden of hospital charges for children.  We have provided &euro;30 million for new drugs and a further &euro;36.5 million for a range of measures, including the safe-staffing framework, anti-microbial resistance and infection control and the implementation of the nursing home expert panel recommendations.<\/p><p> There is &euro;37 million in additional funding for mental health services and &euro;10 million designated from the Covid funding for mental health, providing a total of &euro;47 million.  There is &euro;30 million to build on investment in older persons and dementia services; an additional &euro;105 million for disability services, with a further &euro;10 million in one-off Covid funding for disability services; an additional &euro;10 million for Healthy Ireland; and an additional &euro;6 million for social inclusion, including the national drugs strategy.<\/p><p> With regard to the financial position and the 2021 outturn, the gross provision for the health Vote in 2021 was &euro;22.1 billion.  That comprised &euro;21.1 billion of current expenditure and just over &euro;1 billion capital expenditure.  The &euro;21.1 billion represents the gross funding position for both the <\/p><p>Department of Health and the HSE and includes additional funding of &euro;1.8 billion made available for current expenditure in 2021 in response to Covid-19.<\/p><p> The initial 2021 capital allocation was &euro;893 million.  In response to Covid-19, an additional &euro;155 million was assigned, to bring the total capital allocation that year to more than &euro;1 billion.  The total cost of Covid-19 supports provided by Government to the health service in 2021 was &euro;1.9 billion.  These measures continue to be relevant in 2022 as the pandemic continues.<\/p><p> In framing the 2022 budget, the Oireachtas allocated further additional Exchequer funding for the health sector.  Gross health funding is &euro;22.2 billion, comprising &euro;21.1 billion in current expenditure and &euro;1.1 billion in capital expenditure.  This represents an increase of &euro;51.6 million on the 2021 current expenditure budget, an increase of &euro;1.1 billion or 5.9%, excluding Covid 19 expenditure.  It recognises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing a health service that improves the health and well-being of people in Ireland.  Some &euro;319 million of this is allocated to new measures.  When taken with more &euro;500 million from 2021 and new measures still to be delivered in 2022, it brings the total available for additional capacity and reform to more than &euro;800 million for this year.<\/p><p> The 2022 capital allocation is &euro;12 million above the 2021 figure, which represents a significant increase on pre-Covid-19 allocations and will contribute to the delivery of modern health facilities and equipment throughout the country, both aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare and Project Ireland 2040 and the mission of universal healthcare.<\/p><p> The year 2021 was another difficult year for those working in healthcare.  Our doctors, nurses, health social care professionals and everyone across the health service have been working tirelessly throughout this pandemic.  The great success of our vaccine roll-out has allowed us to move back <\/p><p>to a more normal way of living and working.  While Covid-19 has highlighted major challenges in our health service, it has also highlighted our strengths, including the resilience, professionalism, courage and innovative spirit of our healthcare workers.<\/p><p> Budget 2022 funds our ongoing Covid-19 response but, more than that, it is also about building capacity, hiring staff and bringing positive permanent change to our health service.  The continuing investments made in recent years will mean that, through the reforms being enacted, Ireland will have a better and more resilient public healthcare service.<\/p><p> I will finish off topic.  I extend my thoughts and sympathies to the people of Ukraine, as they face an outrageous and illegal invasion by Russia.  I am pleased to see that Ireland is making its position known very strongly, including in its role in the United Nations, at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#A00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":674,"content":"<p>We all agree with the Minister's sentiments on Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  We propose to take members in ten-minute slots.

The Department of Health has faced many challenges in the past couple of years and in the past year, in particular.  It has done well in very challenging circumstances, despite being a Department that received a great deal of criticism.  Everybody knows best, everybody sits on the fence and everybody makes the commendation afterwards.  The comments usually come afterwards, but not beforehand.  I sympathise with the Minister on what he has to do.<\/p> <p>  This year will be the biggest test of the Department.  How will it restore the health services to what the people expect, given the level of expenditure in the health services, the number of patients on waiting lists and bed waiting lists and given orthopaedic requirements?  How does one, in the shortest possible time, bring around the Department to face those challenges, put them on the front line and deal with them, as they arise?  How does one do so in a way that encourages the public, recognises its concern about the issue and recognises that there is a shortage of nurses in Australia, London and other places?<\/p> <p>  The message there is that it is a heavy and daunting job.  It is a job for people who are dedicated to it.  We should recognise the work done by the health service in the daunting jobs over the past couple of years, the jobs people did and how well they did them.  However, what we do from here on in is important and it must be recognised that a number of high-profile people resigned over the co-ordination between the proposed Sl&aacute;intecare programme and the health programme, as it is to be.<\/p> <p>  The two must converge.  There must be an identification of convergence.  We do not know what will happen as a result of moving apart from one another.  We look for reassurance that the two will converge, the people who had concerns will have had them addressed and that the issues now remaining are within the capacity of the Department, the Minister, the Ministers of State and their officials to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#B00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I echo Deputy Durkan's comments about our healthcare workers.  They have been the very best of us all over the past two years.<\/p><p>They have been extraordinary, but they are exhausted.  Too much is being asked too often of our healthcare workers.  I meet our healthcare workers all over the country.  I met fantastic healthcare workers from Limerick just last week.  They are all tired and need our help.  I echo the acknowledgement of the extraordinary work our healthcare workers have done.<\/p><p> Regarding where we go from here, the first thing to say is that we are absolutely focused on and committed to the mission of achieving universal healthcare.  It is what the entire programme for Government is framed around and what Sl&aacute;intecare provides a path to.  It is one of the most important projects yet to be finished in our country.  We all know that hundreds of thousands of men and women are waiting for care.  Just slightly shy of 100,000 children and adolescents are also waiting for care.  That is simply not acceptable in our country.<\/p><p> To address the situation, we are mobilising the Department and the public health service, our partners outside the public health service and this budget in order to realise the mission of universal healthcare.  In my opening remarks I addressed the three tests of universal healthcare: whether people can get care when they need it; whether consistently high-quality care is received when people do get it; and can people afford it.  To that end, this budget has many affordability measures and we are going to introduce more next year.  This is all part of a journey.<\/p><p> On the provision of high-quality care, it will have been seen that there has been significant investment in our clinical strategies and a new focus on women's healthcare.  That is intended to seek to achieve consistently high-quality care and patient outcomes.  The aspect which has dominated most of the debate around healthcare is access to services.  In that regard, we are doing two things in parallel.  Tomorrow, I will be launching the new waiting list plan for this year.  It is an ambitious &euro;350 million plan.  In addition, we are adding more permanent capacity to the public health service than at any time on record.  While we are doing that, we are doing it in the way set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare policy.  I refer to moving care into the community, increasing productivity, deploying new technologies and moving to a regional healthcare system.

Equally, do we have sufficient wherewithal to deal with the question of orthopaedics?  Given what Mr. Green has said and demonstrated, is it possible to make it happen?  Can we make it happen?<\/p> <p>  The eyes of the community are on the Department of Health now.  The question everybody has is whether the Minister can make this transformation happen.  It affects us, the Minister, the Chair and everybody here as well.  My three questions are aligned with that context.  To what extent have the concerns of those people who were worried about the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, and who resigned as a result, had their fears dealt with?  To what extent is the orthopaedics' capacity capable of dealing with the issues being experienced?  It should be capable of dealing with these needs.

Regarding how people feel about their concerns, I cannot speak to whether they feel those concerns have been addressed.  To my mind, however, the evidence never backed up those concerns.  There were concerns about a lack of implementation, whereas, in fact, the evidence shows more implementation than in any previous year.  Therefore, I have always disagreed with the allegation or concern that progress was not being made.  We have demonstrated comprehensively that significant progress has been made.  We are making progress towards achieving universal healthcare at a level that speaks for itself.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Deputy's second issue, he is probably talking specifically about paediatric orthopaedics.  In that regard, we just funded and launched a &euro;19 million plan.  By the end of the year, that will probably have reached a little over &euro;20 million.  It is a combined approach between Cappagh and Crumlin hospitals, and some private operators may also be used.  The plan seeks to increase treatment for all children waiting for paediatric orthopaedic procedures, including those with spina bifida and scoliosis.  We have set an ambitious target.  Regardless of whether we hit that target by the end of the year, my view is that it is important to push the system as far as it can go and beyond its comfort zone, if we are going to get these children treated.  They must be treated.  The target is that no child would be waiting more than four months for intervention in cases of scoliosis or spina bifida.  It is an ambitious aim.  Some of the surgeons have raised concerns to the effect that it would be an amazing feat to achieve this objective by the end of the year, given the complexities involved.  I am confident, however, that we have a well-funded and serious plan in place.  We are working across all the relevant hospital sites.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the Deputy's question regarding whether we can make all this happen and implement all these ambitious plans as laid out, it remains to be seen whether we will reach all the targets.  The targets we have set are intentionally stretch targets.  Their very nature means that we are trying to push the system outside of its comfort zone.  I refer to pushing the Department and the public health service, the HSE, beyond what has been achieved before.  Regardless of whether we hit all the stretch targets, there is absolute determination in the Department and in the HSE and complete determination and resolution in Government regarding the need to implement the policies on patient affordability, clinical strategies, waiting lists and a permanent increase in the capacity and modernisation of the public health service<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#C00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":680,"content":"<p>We wish the Minister well.

I echo the Minister's words on that issue.<\/p> <p>  To start with some of what the Minister said, there is no disagreement regarding the need for us to improve accessibility and affordability in the context of quality care.  I do not think anybody questions the quality of care that people get when they access the health service.  The problem is getting access.  When people get access, they get good quality care.  Obviously, there are areas where we can improve, but, by and large, the quality of care provided by the Irish health service is second to none.  Therefore, access and affordability are the two key issues.<\/p> <p>  Starting with waiting lists, I have several questions that I will come to shortly regarding the targets set in the budgets of 2021 and 2022.

That concerns me, because the Minister said earlier that one of the priorities must be access.  When we look at the data relating to waiting lists, it is frightening when we see the number of people who are waiting for healthcare.  From looking at the figures, sometimes there is an over-reliance or focus on what is happening on the acute side.<\/p><p>It is very important.  We have nearly 898,000 on some form of health waiting list when we look at the totality, but the active acute waiting list is about 703,000, which is still huge.  There is also the length of time people are waiting.  We have nearly 165,000 patients waiting over 18 months on some form of outpatient waiting list.  Separate from that, we have 226,000 people waiting for a diagnostic scan, which is a huge number.  Although I do not have time, I could talk to the Minister about my own family members and the constituents I have met who have had to go private because they simply could not wait for a diagnosis from the public system.  That is a huge number of people on top of the almost 900,000 people waiting for access to a consultant or waiting for treatment.<\/p><p> We then go into the community, where this information is not published.  We can go onto the National Treatment Purchase Fund website and we will get all the information we want on the acute side but we cannot get access to similar information publicly for community or for diagnostics.  Over a long period of putting in parliamentary questions and getting the full breakdown across home help, orthodontics, psychology, counselling, CAMHS, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, podiatry, ophthalmology, audiology and dietetics, I found that some 225,000 people are on waiting lists in the community.<\/p><p> That is almost 900,000 on the acute side, 226,000 waiting for a diagnostic assessment and 225,000 on a community waiting list, yet in this package that the Minister will announce tomorrow, not one single cent is additional funding.  It is all funding already provided, with some of it going to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, and we will have to see what that &euro;200 million actually does.  I have seen it reported that the Minister is setting very ambitious targets.  Does he believe there is any chance of achieving those targets given there is not a cent of additional funding beyond what was provided and given the scale of the waiting lists and the number of people waiting, but also the length of time they are waiting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#C01000","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":688,"content":"<p>The situation is not acceptable.  As the Deputy quite rightly lays out, it is not acceptable for hospitals, for inpatients, for outpatients, for diagnostics, for adults and children or for community care.

Additional funding is not required at this point because a fund like this has never been created before, to the best of my knowledge.  We have &euro;350 million and I would love nothing more than for the system to have fully utilised the &euro;350 million before the end of the year.

It is a very significant amount of money, so let us see how we go on that.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely accept the Deputy&rsquo;s challenge on community.  We are not ignoring community and it would be wrong to do so.  Part of what we are doing in the plan the Deputy will see tomorrow is that we are looking at diagnostics.

I will have to check the figure but it was something like 138,000 radiology scans last year and we have rolled that over into this year.

Second, the fact there is now a gap between what they believe is possible and what is funded does leave us opportunities to look at new things.  I appreciate we are out of time but I want to make the following point.  I was in Limerick last week and one of the things that was very clear to me was that there is an urgent need for more emergency specialists, for example.  That hospital has eight and the point was made to me by one of them that the equivalent hospital in Australia would have in excess of 20.  The fact we may have some headroom for this year means, and I would be very interested in the committee's view on this through the year, that we can all take this as an opportunity to ask whether there are other areas where we clearly need more clinical workforce that we could move on and sanction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#D01800","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Minister later with other questions.

While I am going to get into the substance of it straight away, I am very uncomfortable with civil servants being secretly recorded, those recordings being given to newspapers and then those civil servants being named in those newspapers.  I hope we are all on the same page on this.  Civil servants must challenge the agencies, in this case the HSE.  They must challenge the Government and Ministers and Ministers of State, like the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and me.  This kind of activity can lead to a chilling effect.  It turns out I have been recorded - I think it was reported yesterday - or meetings I was at were recorded.  I just wanted to make that point.  The substance of this is serious nonetheless.  As for some of the reporting, the facts simply do not back it up and some of the comments made were simply inaccurate.  I understand some of the material is recordings and some of it is contemporaneous notes of what people say other people had said to them, so it could have been fourth-hand before it got into the newspapers.<\/p> <p>  On the fake targets, I do not accept that.  Deputy Cullinane and I just talked about it.  I make no apologies for setting targets for healthcare recruitment that, if I am blunt, potentially make the HSE and the Department uncomfortable.  I make no apologies for that.  It is part of our job in Government and part of our job in the Oireachtas to push the system beyond what it might be comfortable with in terms of the public health service.<\/p> <p>  The prior year adjustment was not hundreds of millions of euro as reported.  The latest estimate is it will be below &euro;100 million and it is an accounting correction done each year because of cash versus accrual accounting.<\/p> <p>  The mental health commentary attributed, which the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is very aware of, was simply inaccurate.  The HSE in fact looked for &euro;35 million, that amount was more or less given and then there was a one-off payment of &euro;10 million to address some very serious Covid issues as well.<\/p> <p>  Nonetheless, significant work is required to modernise financial reporting within the HSE.  The most important project is the integrated financial management project.  It was launched several years ago.  I would like to see it further along and so would the HSE.  It was significantly derailed by the cyberattack.  Obviously, Covid pulled everything but we must now redouble our efforts to have that system in place.  I can tell the Deputy the board also is acutely aware of this.  Last year it put in an important innovation in the form of a balanced scorecard for performance right across the HSE.<\/p> <p>  As much of the detail was simply inaccurate, the core question is do we need to do more urgently on modernising financial reporting within the health service.  The answer is we do and the chief executive, the chair, the board, the Secretary General and the Department are all aligned on that need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#E00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":709,"content":"<p>Okay but it is also reported that senior officials in the Minister's own Department do not have confidence in the HSE financial reporting because of the service's weak financial systems.  That in turn leads to a lack of confidence on the part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the whole health Vote, which in turn undermines the confidence of the Taoiseach.  When it comes to the health service and particularly the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme, we need to have the Taoiseach fully committed.  However, if the systems are not in place to provide the credibility and the confidence in the financial arrangements within the HSE, then we are not going to get the ongoing support of the Taoiseach on this.  That is something that must be borne in mind.<\/p> <p>  Nobody is taking from the HSE's handling of Covid, nor that of the Minister or the Department.  We need to make that clear from the start.  Covid was very well handled, especially the vaccination programme in its entirety.  That was well done and the testing services were well done and all of that.  However, the financial issues within the HSE existed for many years prior to Covid.  Unless they are addressed now as a matter of urgency, we are going to continue to be in this twilight zone about where money is going in the health service.  There will be a continuing view it is a black hole and we are not going to have credibility about the spending of moneys in health.<\/p> <p>  There are fundamental things that need to happen and happen very quickly and I would like the Minister to report on those.  These include, as he has already referenced, a fully-integrated financial management system within the HSE.  It is just extraordinary that an organisation with a staff of 130,000 and a budget of &euro;21 billion does not have an integrated financial management system, so we do not know where money is going.  We do not know if we are getting value for money.  We do not know if money is going where it was intended to go.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect is the individual health identifier, which is an essential tool.  A business plan was produced in 2016.  There has been very slow progress.<\/p> <p>  I raise this business of money being allocated on an annual basis for staff in different areas and then when it comes to the end of the year, people put their hands in the air and say they could not recruit consultants or GPs or nurses or allied health professionals.  They say it is too bad there is a serious recruitment.  What is being done about that?  Why has no ongoing workforce plan been produced?<\/p> <p>  The other point relates to devolution of power from the centre, which is what is proposed in the regional structures, the need for accountability legislation and a population-based approach to service planning.  The Minister spoke earlier about progress in the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  In his own progress report produced last week, his contention there would not be borne out.  The scorecard is not good with Sl&aacute;intecare.  I can go through them all but he knows the progress report, on pages 14 and 15, lists all the areas where the situation has disimproved.  It is not a very good scorecard.  Will he tell us what he is going to do to ensure the four areas I listed will be progressed consistently and rapidly in the coming year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#E00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The capital budget for the programme is &euro;82 million.  That gives a sense of exactly how big it is.  The original project timelines targeted about 80% of health expenditure transacted by 2025.  I share the Deputy's concern we need to move more quickly on this because we are talking about vast amounts of public money being allocated in what I see as one of the most important areas.<\/p> <p>  There has been work on unique patient identifiers, which are needed.  We will all be aware of some of the concerns - legal concerns and so forth - that were raised before.  It is not acceptable that we do not have it.  Other countries have them.  We created one for the vaccination programme very quickly, when the need arose.  There is now work looking at that, so I fully share the Deputy's view.  We cannot have integrated patient systems across the country without having this unique patient identifier.  In the previous D&aacute;il, the committee spent time hearing evidence that some clinical trials, which our patients need to have access to, cannot happen because we do not have unique patient identifiers.<\/p> <p>  We are out of time but I am happy to come back later on both the workforce plan and the population-based funding.

The aim of us using capacity from the private or independent sector is purely with a view to treating as many public patients as possible.  As the Deputy will be aware, there have been several safety net agreements put in place.  This means that when the capacity within the HSE hospital system is put under a lot of pressure by Covid we can activate capacity within the private or independent sector.  There is a fourth safety net agreement being put in place at the moment for exactly that reason.  Our hospitals have individual relationships with private hospitals that they use for operating theatres, bed capacity and sometimes for critical care capacity.  An example is paediatric orthopaedics.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland sometimes uses capacity in the Blackrock Clinic to make sure children can get treated, which is an example of a local arrangement.  The big one is the NTPF.  Last year, the allocation for that was &euro;100 million and this year the allocation is &euro;150 million.<\/p> <p>  I know some member are uncomfortable with the money going into and being paid out to private providers but there are two points to make.  First, last year the majority of the NTPF money went into public hospitals.  Some might think it is all spent on the private sector but it is not.  I have a figure of 60% in my head for the proportion of funds that were used for insourcing last year.  This concerned people working longer hours in the public hospitals and so forth.  Second, I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s comment, in that we are investing so much money in the public health service because, in time, it will be able to handle all of our population&rsquo;s requirements.  Universal healthcare as an ideology remains neutral on which hospital someone gets care in and it is about the patient rather than the provider.  Ireland, the UK, Germany and Canada all have different models for providing this.  Some are largely public, some are a mix and some are independent and non-profit trusts.  In Ireland, this Government and, I think, all Members are committed to a public health service that has sufficient capacity to treat all patients in the Republic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#F01000","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":723,"content":"<p>My next question is on the recruitment of additional neurological nurses.

I do not believe the current training path they are asked to pursue on their way to becoming consultants is appropriate.  It needs to be completely changed.

They have to travel around the country every year for potentially ten years and are not supported in doing so.  Their working week is far too long and they do not receive some basic supports that they should receive.  On the back of that meeting, I contacted the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and have invited it in for talks.  I have asked the Department to put together for me an approach for how we do this.  We must start by listening very carefully to the doctors themselves.  I heard a lot of things last week that are simply not acceptable.<\/p> <p>  We have already taken some measures.  The Deputy may be aware that last year I removed the restriction on non-EU NCHDs training as specialists.  We need to keep moving with that.  We also need to significantly increase the number of training posts.  We do not have enough.  This is tied in with an increase in the number of consultants.  Ireland has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, ratio of specialists to population in the EU.  It is not acceptable.  We need a significant increase in our consultant workforce.<\/p> <p>  I understand Deputy Kenny is referring mainly to NCHDs.  We need to see serious change in how they are treated, their conditions of work and the training opportunities available to them in order that they can lead a decent and reasonable life in the six, eight or ten years they are training to be specialists.  Too many of them do not have that opportunity based on what is asked of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#G00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Following his engagement with junior doctors and graduate doctors and having listened to some of their testimony, what one change would the Minister make?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#G00300","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":729,"content":"<p>There are a few changes I would make and we will be talking to the NCHDs and their representative bodies about them.

It is not acceptable for us to ask that of them.  I am also very uncomfortable with some of the reports on working hours.  We have European Union working time directives in place and they need to be followed.  There may be some exemptions available but the directives need to be followed.<\/p> <p>  It is an issue of giving non-consultant hospital doctors a bit of stability in their lives and allowing them to do more than just be in a hospital working and training for 60, 70 or 80 hours per week.

Many women go in to train as non-consultant hospital doctors and the conversion rate to specialists should be maintained but it is not being maintained.

In October 2021, this figure stood at 131,000.  The biggest complaint I am hearing from consultants is that they cannot get access to theatre time.  A number of consultants have told me that whereas before they had access to theatre for a full day each week, they are getting one half-day each week.  One consultant, for example, tries to get three operations done in the one afternoon session in theatre provided each week.  The consultant in question would normally list three people for operations but is finding that if the patient is not in theatre by 4 p.m., the operation must be cancelled and the consultant ends up doing two of the three scheduled operations in that week.<\/p> <p>  It is great to talk about recruiting staff but many of these highly specialised consultants who have trained in Ireland may have worked in the UK, the United States or Canada where they had access to theatre for at least one full day per week.  In some places, they had two days of theatre time each week.  When they come back to Ireland they find they are lucky to get one half-day a week.  I heard of one case recently where a consultant was in theatre with a full complement of staff, there were empty beds in the ward on which they normally work, yet the consultant was advised that they could not do any elective surgery on that particular day.

We are doing a few things at the same time.  We are increasing the number of operating theatres.  We also have to look at how often those operating theatres are open.  In too many of our hospitals the operating theatre is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  In private hospitals, the operating theatres are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and they are opening them on Saturdays and Sundays.

It takes too long to add critical care beds and operating theatres and to build hospitals.<\/p><p>It is something the Department and the HSE are looking at.  I accept it may not apply in this case but what the hospitals say to me is that one of the factors that slows this is planning, the environmental impact statements and so forth.  They can take a huge amount of time.  We also have quite an onerous set of steps that the State must go through in terms of capital appraisal and business cases, particularly when we get over &euro;100 million.  At that stage we are into a whole different process that really takes a long time.  We are looking at ways to speed that up and I absolutely share the Deputy's concern.<\/p><p> The Deputy made a very important point on the operating theatres.  We need more operating theatres and we must be able to run the ones we have longer.  To do that, we must invest and grow the workforce, particularly around theatre nurses.  There is a case to be made for an assistant role within theatres.  I am aware the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and possibly others do not agree with that position but there is a case to be made for it.  We must invest in more theatre nurses.  The HSE is doing much work and the chief nursing officer in the Department is doing much work on that but one of the keys to this is the group of theatre nurses.  We must be creative.  For example, I met representatives of Children's Health Ireland in the past two or three weeks to speak about paediatric orthopaedics.  We are funding a fifth operating theatre at Temple Street hospital and much work at Cappagh.  We need more theatre nurses.  One of the things the director of nursing said to me was that one of the biggest challenges in Dublin is cost of living and nurses finding accommodation.  We need to be creative and if that is ultimately what is stopping us hiring nurses, we need to look, for example, at the State, the HSE or whatever it may be taking over and providing accommodation.

It is under pressure every day and at a crisis point most weeks.  There is a real feeling in the mid-west, both in healthcare staff currently in the hospital system but also in many retired people in the HSE and the hospital system who now have the liberty to speak a little more freely.  They have said in the media, including on Clare FM and Limerick radio, that the solution to this must be an elective hospital in the mid-west to ease the burden and the pressures faced by University Hospital Limerick.<\/p> <p>  I brought up this matter just last week with Mr. Robert Watt and Mr. Paul Reid.  The area should still be in the mix.  I also believe there is a potential solution because there is a private hospital on the cusp of being developed in the small village of Coonagh, which sits right on the Clare and Limerick border.  It is so accessible to the entire region.  There will be a private 150-bed hospital built there.

I do not know what happened on the Minister's visit, but I know when the Minister, Deputy Harris, visited years ago, trolleys were brought to the morgue corridor.  They were pushed there - out of sight, out of mind.  No problems here.  We got back to normality again because this place is really well managed.  They need to be on site.  I ask that the Minister intervene in this.<\/p> <p>  I have one final issue that perhaps the Minister would wrap up with in his response.  During Covid, some services were stripped back from local health centres such as those in Broadford and Kilrush, County Clare.  Dental services are no longer provided.  They must be reinstated.  I hope the Minister will wrap up some of these issues in the time we have left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#J01000","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":755,"content":"<p>If there are specific areas and services the Deputy would like me to look into within the region, be it dental services in a particular primary care centre or, indeed, anything else, he should let me know and we will engage with the HSE on it.<\/p> <p>  With regards to where the management are working, I am not familiar with exactly who is working where and why.

We have plenty of plans.  We have programmes for Government.  We have clinical strategies.  We have a load of these things but they do not mean anything unless we can actually deliver for patients.<\/p> <p>  I believe we can deliver and are delivering.  The committee has acknowledged, for which I thank it, the work the health service and the Department have done in terms of the response to Covid.  It has been broadly welcomed and appreciated.  We know the health service can not only deliver on Covid but deliver to one of the highest standards anywhere in the world.  What we have seen and acknowledged is an extraordinary operational response to Covid.  Where else do we need to deliver?  We need to deliver on the affordability measures, including for six-year-olds and seven-year-olds, drugs payment schemes and so forth.  All those areas are being and will be delivered this on year.  Healthcare will be more affordable throughout the year.  Free contraception for 17- to 25-year-olds will be delivered on.<\/p> <p>  We then come to the clinical strategies.  It is my view that we have not been delivering at the level we should have been delivering for some years on the clinical strategies.  Partly, that comes down to funding.  Last year, I allocated full funding to the strategies.  The national cancer strategy, which got &euro;20 million, the ambulance strategy, the maternity strategy, and the trauma strategy were fully funded and they have been fully funded again this year.  They have the money.  The clinical leads are dedicated.  There are some very important measures that are going on below the radar.  I will give an example from the national cancer strategy.  I was in the Mater Hospital.  They have hired a psycho-oncology team.  They have increased the workforce.  Up until last year, patients actively being treated for cancer who got really sick, which happens regularly, had to come in through the emergency department.  Sometimes they had to sit on a chair for hours in an emergency department in a pandemic, while completely immunosuppressed, and wait for care.  Now, patients phone the Mater to say they are coming in.<\/p><p>They are then taken then into the cancer ward and cancer units and are treated there.  <\/p><p> There are some amazing things happening in the national maternity strategy.   I visited Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda where they showed what we might call the traditional birthing suites there and, then, the new ones.  One would be so proud of what the health service, the midwives, and the obstetricians are doing in modern patient-led care where, if a woman wants midwifery-led care, she gets it.<\/p><p> On the clinical strategies there are some very important things happening.  I am launching the waiting list plan tomorrow.  It is very ambitious and must deliver.  In the final three months of last year, we launched the initial phase of the waiting list plan and it worked well.  Over those three months the total numbers waiting fell by nearly 5.5%.  That was due, in part, to tens of thousands of adults and a smaller number of children being treated as part of that.<\/p><p> On permanent capacity, it is a mixed bag.  We have all talked about, and Deputy Cullinane alluded to the fact that 14,000 staff were funded for last year and a little over 6,000 were hired.  Some 10,000 staff are funded for this year and the HSE is saying that perhaps 5,500 will be hired.  We can look at that in two ways.  One is that we are significantly below our ambition, which is true.  It is also the case, however, that the two years with the highest number of additions to the health workforce since the foundation of the HSE were last year and the year before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#J01400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I will come in on home care because I know that the committee has examined this over the past number of weeks.

I want to make one broad point first and I then have a number of specific questions on targets that were set.  Equally, specific issues are referred to in the Minister&rsquo;s own briefing document.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier, it is very important to set ambitious targets.  I would hope, if I was in the same position as the Minister for Health, that I would want to push the system to its limits and would want to get as much done as quickly as I could.  That would involve recruiting as many staff, opening as many beds and getting as much capital funding and capacity into the system as possible.  Obviously there will always be situations where targets simply may not been met for whatever reason.  There is a big difference between setting ambitious targets and setting targets that the Minister may know simply cannot be met.  People see that then as a wish list and it undermines confidence.  That is why there is commentary on some of the staffing commitments that were given on bed numbers, for example, and on acute inpatient beds going back to 2021, when a target of 1,146 beds announced.  I do not believe that we are even going to reach that target by the end of this year.  That creates problems for people across the board. <\/p> <p>  We have touched on where we have people who cannot get access to home helps because the staff are not there.  That is the reality.  The funding has been made available but the staffing is not there to provide a great deal of the services.  We see this in respect of children with special needs who cannot get access to speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy or child psychology, because, again, the posts are not there.<\/p><p>There must be a joined-up approach.  The targets being set must actually be deliverable and matched with workforce planning.  Otherwise, they are fake targets and wish lists, which undermines confidence.  I hope that, in whatever plan comes tomorrow, the targets are actually real and that we are not again setting targets we know in our hearts will not be met.  People now expect we will meet the targets we set as opposed to the targets we set not being met, which we have seen so often with health targets.<\/p><p> I will turn to one specific issue the Minister mentioned earlier, the issue of paediatric orthopaedics and the total funding package he recently announced.

There are many more who are registered with the scheme but who are simply not operating it.  The Irish Dental Association says there may be as few as 600 dentists now operating the scheme.

There is an ongoing conversation between the Department and the Irish Dental Association.  They have had two meetings and they are having another in approximately two weeks' time.  At the same time, we need a root-and-branch reform of the dental scheme more generally.  Talks need to start on that this year.

This is a very important issue because dentists are leaving the scheme.  Regardless of their motivations or of the rights and wrongs of the matter, they are voting with their feet and are leaving the scheme in big numbers.  The consequence of this is people are not getting treatment.  I have been given information on the waiting times for children's orthodontic treatment.  It is horrific.

Now, more than 6,000 children have moved from assessment of need to waiting on services.  What the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been doing with the HSE is rolling out a new network of health and social care professionals teams.  Many of them were hired last year.  A lot more recruitment is required.  I fully share the concern and urgency regarding the point the Deputy has raised.

I have spoken to many parents in recent weeks.  I have spoken to legal people taking court cases on the very assessments the Minister is speaking about.  I have spoken to advocacy groups which are also raising concerns about the figure of 6,000 and what has happened.  As the Minister knows, the Act provides for assessments of need.  The Act clearly states the assessment of need should determine whether a child has a disability, the extent and nature of the disability and the services the child needs.  What actually happened was the HSE created a new assessment of needs process through the standard operating procedure.  Most children get a 20-minute screening.  It is not even an assessment.  Quite rightly, it is referred to by parents and advocacy groups as a screening.  I have been in GP surgeries for as long as 20 minutes.  How in God's name is someone meant to determine the nature and extent of the disability of a child in 20 minutes?<\/p> <p>  I will set out what happens so the Minister is aware of it.  Children with autism apply for an assessment of needs, which we know should be provided within six months.  The children get this screening as opposed to an assessment.  If it is determined they may have a disability or may need more of an assessment, they go on a separate waiting list.  We are creating waiting lists within waiting lists.  While 6,000 people have had this assessment of need under the standard operating procedure, which in essence many would describe as screening, many of them are not getting their service statement which states the services they need.  This is simply because 20 minutes will not cut it.<\/p> <p>  There are fundamental problems with the assessment of need.  What is crucial is the provision of services.  The Minister might be aware, although perhaps he is not, that there is a case in the Court of Appeal on the standard operating procedure.  It is challenging precisely what I have just said about the nature of the assessment being done.  Does the Minister accept a child with autism or special needs having a 20-minute screening?  Does he accept it would be almost impossible to determine the level of services and the nature and extent of a disability a child has in a 20-minute screening?  Does he accept as a layperson that this simply would not be appropriate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#M01900","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  There has been a lot of debate within the service around the assessment of need.  The position two years ago was that every child, or the majority of children, went through a significant assessment of many hours.  One of the results of this was that we had more than 6,500 children waiting for an assessment.  The clinical advice we got was that many of those children did not need the entire assessment, while some did.  The expert view, and it is an approach used in Northern Ireland, for example, is there is an initial assessment where experienced professionals assess whether a child quite clearly needs one service, be it occupational health, speech and language or physiotherapy.  There are other children who need much more rigorous assessment.  It is a triage process.

Funding for the drug task forces under the national drugs strategy has increased by &euro;1 million.  I appreciate there is an accounting issue with what appears to be a &euro;10 million reduction, which it to do with different subheads, but the total funding has increased.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern.  Deputy McAuliffe and myself met community workers about the crack cocaine problem some time ago.  The Chairman referenced the heroin epidemic.  They point they made to us was that they had been the community workers during the heroin epidemic and that the crack cocaine epidemic blew it out of the water.  They had never seen anything like the desperation, the level of addiction, the violence, the organised crime, the intimidation and moneylending associated with it.  I am aware of it in my constituency in Wicklow.  When I meet various community groups they report a level of violence and intimidation they have never seen before.  Some of the accounts of intimidation and violence being visited upon the families of people in addiction are like nothing we have ever seen previously and, therefore, we need to need to do more.  Additional funding has been allocated.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, would be very happy, as would I,  to engage further with the committee on that.  Part of it a health response and part of it is a justice response but an awful lot needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  Organ donation and transplant services are part of one of the fully funded strategies for this year.  Critically, I will introduce the human tissue Bill soon.  There is more that we can do.  People are waiting for organ transplants for longer than they should.  The Bill will help, as will the opt-out process.  I think it is one that is broadly supported politically.  It is on the agenda to introduce this year.

Healthcare is a busy place at the best of times.  There is a level of exhaustion now in the staff I am meeting that is beyond normal tiredness or normal busyness.  It has been relentless for two years for the staff.  Not only have they had to work under intense pressure, not only have they had to walk in every day to high-risk environments where many of them have got sick or got Covid-19, they have had to deal with huge trauma that has come with Covid-19.  I was very taken by some intensive care nurses I met - hardened, seasoned professionals with decades of experience in intensive care.  They had seen every human situation, hardship and suffering in terms of patients in intensive care, and they told me they were traumatised by Covid-19 like nothing they have ever had to deal with.  They said it was a combination of how vicious Covid-19 is in attacking multiple organs at the same time but also that patients were lying in intensive care completely isolated from their families and friends, being cared for by people wearing a lot of PPE.<\/p> <p>  There is a level of trauma and exhaustion in healthcare that has to be dealt with.  Obviously if such things as security are required locally, it goes without saying they will be funded.  Long Covid is being taken very seriously and is being looked at.  What nurses, doctors and health and social care professionals say to me when I ask them what the single most important thing is we can do for them to make their job sustainable and one they love coming to work to do, they say to me to increase the workforce.  We have to hit safe staffing levels.  That is fully backed and supported by the INMO and by the Oireachtas.  The results from the pilot projects that were presented at the INMO conference in Cork a few years ago are beyond question in terms of the well-being of the nurses and midwives themselves.  We have talked about the non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  Much more is required than increasing the number of NCHDs.  A root-and-branch piece of work is required.  We need more consultants.  We need more doctors, nurses, health and social care professionals, and we need to acknowledge what they have been through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#O00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>All HSE staff have free access through SilverCloud to self-directed online supports for mental health.

I received a parliamentary question response last week in regard to the number of people over 75 waiting for various types of healthcare.  In January, we had just under 1,100 people over 75 waiting more than 24 hours on a hospital trolley or waiting for access to an emergency department.  That is a lot of people over 75 in one month across acute hospitals waiting over 24 hours.  It is horrific.  There are also 86,000 people over 75 waiting for an inpatient or an outpatient hospital appointment.  Of those, 28,000 are waiting more than a year.  These are patients over 75.  When the Minister publishes his waiting list plan tomorrow, it must not give false hope, it needs to have realistic targets and it cannot have what some have described as fake targets.  They certainly have to be targets that are ambitious but realistic.  It must also be targeted.  In regard to that waiting list plan, are those 86,000 people over 75 going to be a priority?  I believe the vast majority of people would say no patient should be waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant.  No patient should be waiting on a hospital trolley more than 24 hours.  To have such numbers of people over the age of 75 for whom that is the lived reality is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#O00500","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":846,"content":"<p>Completely unacceptable on both counts.  It is unacceptable that anyone would be waiting more than 24 hours on a trolley for admission to a hospital.  It is even more unacceptable that people over 75 would be waiting.  It is being addressed but it is not acceptable that it is the case.  A huge amount of extra resources were put in place, and what we have seen, in particular since about the second week in January, is a lot of delayed or deferred care and many people coming in.  I met with the HSE several times on this issue and asked why this is happening given the huge extra resources we put in place in terms of prevention, emergency department, acute capacity and discharge.  There are various Covid-related reasons the HSE points to, of which we are all aware, but one of the things it said is the number of people over 75 coming in has gone up a great deal.  What is more, when they are admitted, the average length of stay for them is much longer.<\/p> <p>  In regard to those waiting for inpatient or outpatient care, there are more than 700,000 on the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, lists.  As the Deputy said, a good proportion of that number is over 75.  We are not specifically targeting people based on age, to be clear.  We are targeting people based on clinical need.  Some of this will come down to individual consultants looking at their patient lists and, on the basis they now have extra outpatient facilities, the hospital has extra outpatient facilities or there are extra operating theatre lists, saying which people are the highest priority.  One thing we must do is, regardless of a person's age, whether he or she is eight or 80, we must ensure those waiting the longest get some form of priority.  People are waiting years in our country.  In one of the richest and most developed countries in the world, to have people waiting years is not acceptable.  That is what tomorrow's plan is all about.  It is to start a full-scale assault on those waiting lists and bring them down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022400002#O00600","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1645660800,"counter":847,"content":"<p>I support the points made by my colleague in regard to the drugs issue.  It is a health issue and a justice issue.  It has to be approached on two levels and to have all resources made available to deal with it.  That needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  What we are doing at present is perpetuating it.  The drug issue is growing.  We are a drug-ridden society, and people will tell you it affects all classes of people throughout the country who did not ordinarily resort to drugs.  We must cut off the supply and we have to improve the rehabilitation system in a way that encourages people away from drugs - all drugs, whatever they are.<\/p> <p>  I have one question.  Criticisms have been levelled at health institutions in the past in regard to the degree to which the HSE was remote from the people.  From the point of view of practitioners, the regions were remote from the HSE by virtue of their geographic location.  I want the Minister and the Minister of State to recognise that and try to deal with it.<\/p><p>We spent a great deal of time in the run-up to the report on the Sl&aacute;intecare programme in ensuring that there was a return to a feeling among the people in the regions, whether they be GPs or specialists or whatever the case may be, that there would be a return to recognition of their particular position, as opposed to their position be determined by somebody at the HSE, at the central level, telling them what they do.

I was on a drugs programme previously many years ago and we came to the conclusion that methadone treatment was excellent as long as it showed results.  There has to be a result at the end of the day.  Feeding the drug problem more and knowing that suppliers of the industry will supply more will not solve the issue.  We put them out of business.  They have the most growing business in the country at present.  We cannot continue as we are.  We cannot continue as a society.<\/p> <p>  The Minister already referenced society becoming more violent.  It sure as hell is becoming more violent.

When the Minister was in, he said they would look at that.  We have a situation where some drugs task forces are on less money now than they were a number of years ago.  That is unacceptable, particularly in view of the challenge that communities are facing on it.  Again, as part of the Minister looking at the Estimates that - I asked the question about the decrease - even if there is a slight increase, it would help.  The challenge is huge out there and it should not be a case of someone who is looking for supports and needs medical supports and rehabilitation should be waiting for a long time to get that support.<\/p> <p>  Many of the drugs task forces had front-line services that worked through the pandemic.  They dealt with those who were coming to them and tried to do it as safely as possible.  They all talk in terms of resources that are needed for them to continue to support people who are very ill and need that support.  It is not just the addict - it is the family.  It is the impact it has not only on the family, but society as well.  I suppose people are so scared about crack cocaine because it has the potential not only to destroy the individual, but also destroy the family and the community itself.

That will be a huge problem over the next two to three years because there are quite a number of people due to retire.<\/p> <p>  A second issue that I know the Minister cannot come back to me today on is the step-down facilities from hospitals and a faster turnover of patients out of hospitals.  The biggest problem that hospitals have and, in fairness, they work extremely hard trying to co-ordinate getting patients out who the hospital has done all that it can for, is access to step-down facilities.

One of the big things that is driving this, as the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, said previously, was about half of the nursing homes were in the 28-day period post-outbreak, where there could be no discharge.  Just in the last week, the HSE has changed that 28-day period to between seven and ten days.  That will help.

Currently, about 230 people fall into that category in the acute system.  However, the fact that the guidelines were changed last week, and how they can also take back in who actually have Covid but are not shedding the disease at that time, we hope will make a big difference, but we probably will not see the impact of that for two to three weeks.
