This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Paula O&rsquo;Connor, deputy director of audit.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The RTB has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters during the course of the engagement: the landlord registration system, including the number of prosecutions; compliance of landlords with the Revenue Commissioners; inspections of housing assistance payment, HAP, properties; the RTB&rsquo;s dispute-resolution mechanism; staffing levels and retention; the RTB&rsquo;s preferred model for tenant deposits, adjudications, and European best practice; and the number of landlords leaving the market.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the RTB: Mr. Tom Dunne, chairperson; Mr. Niall Byrne, director; Mr. Bryan Kelly, head of finance, governance and risk management; and Ms Caren Gallagher, head of communications and research.

As they are within the precincts of the Parliament, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with that.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645695000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies Board, formerly the Private Residential Tenancies Board, was established in 2004 to regulate the private rental housing sector.  It has evolved since then to include the private rental, approved housing bodies and student-specific accommodation sectors.<\/p> <p>  The board&rsquo;s income in 2020 amounted to &euro;18.3 million, down from &euro;19 million in 2019.  The majority of the income comes from fees for the registration of new tenancies, which amounted to just under &euro;11.7 million, or over 60% of income in 2020.  The fees are based on flat rates per registration, and legislation provides for the board to determine the amount charged, subject to the consent of the Minister.<\/p> <p>Exchequer funding is provided to the board to cover the shortfall between income and expenditure.  Funding totalling just under &euro;6.7 million was provided to the board in respect of 2020.  This was sourced from the Vote for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The board&rsquo;s expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;18 million.<\/p> <p>  I certified the 2020 financial statements on 15 June 2021 and issued a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  One of the key functions of the board is the maintenance of a publicly searchable database of registered tenancies, which the board also relies on to underpin analysis of trends in the private rental market.  The statement on internal control presented with the financial statements discloses that difficulties had emerged with a project being undertaken by the board to develop a new management system for tenancy registrations and disputes.  Significant delays in project delivery had occurred, and there was an increase in the expected cost.  The total cost of the project was then expected to be &euro;5.2 million, approximately &euro;1.9 million or 58% higher than originally budgeted.  The board undertook a review of the project and subsequently enhanced its project oversight.<\/p> <p>  When I was signing off on the audit in June 2021, the statement on internal control stated that the board expected to bring the new case management system into use during the summer of 2021.  However, I note that the sentence about the expected project completion date does not appear in the English language version that was presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It does appear in the Irish language version.  As a matter of principle, financial statements and accompanying documents should always be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the form settled at the date of certification, except for tidying up of any typos and so on.  Therefore, the sentence should not have been removed.  We have this week received assurances from the board that no other material post-certification changes were made to the financial statements.  The representatives of the board will be in a position to provide an update on the progress made since last summer regarding the new case management system, including an update on final project cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Mr. Dunne is very welcome.

I ask the Chairman to tell me if I am getting too close to the end of that.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members, for the invitation to attend the committee today.  My name is Tom Dunne and I am the chair of the Residential Tenancies Board.  I understand that the focus of the meeting today is on the audited financial statements and on some specific aspects of the work of the Residential Tenancies Board that have been raised in advance by the committee.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied today by Mr. Niall Byrne, who was recently appointed as director and commenced his role at the end of January.  I would also like to introduce Ms Caren Gallagher, head of communications and research and Mr. Bryan Kelly, head of finance, governance and risk management.<\/p> <p>  In advance of the committee meeting today, we provided detailed briefing material for committee members, as well as our 2020 annual report, and an advance copy of our opening statement.  I hope this information was of assistance to the members.<\/p> <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board is a public body, established in 2004 under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The role of the board is to support, develop and promote a well-functioning rental housing sector in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will just list these items briefly; they can be expanded on in the opening statement members have to hand.  Under the relevant statutes, the RTB is responsible for: the operation of the national registration system; provision of an efficient and cost-effective dispute-resolution service to tenants, landlords and related third parties in these sectors; the active investigation of non-compliance with residential tenancies legislation and for the issuing of administrative sanctions, where those are justified; publishing the quarterly rent index for private rented accommodation and conducting research into the sector; providing information to landlords, tenants and the broad public on the rights and responsibilities of all parties under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.<\/p><p>We are acutely aware that the last number of years have posed significant challenges for both landlords and tenants.  The Covid-19 pandemic has created further difficulties for people in the sector, as well as for the RTB.  To inform the sector, policymakers and the general public, the RTB published detailed research reports on the rental sector during 2021, which offer a comprehensive insight into the experiences and perspectives of landlords, tenants and agents.  Among other insights, the research shows that, notwithstanding the very real challenges in the sector, 79% of tenants said their renting experience was positive and 88% of smaller landlords indicated that their experience with their current tenants was positive.  We believe this is an important fact that reflects positively on the rental sector in Ireland.  This research also showed that affordability is the key issue for tenants and that a proportion of smaller landlords, which is 26%, intend to sell a property within the next five years.<\/p><p> During 2020, the work of the RTB, was focused primarily on ensuring continuity of critical regulatory services during the pandemic and on the effective implementation of an unprecedented series of legislative measures, which continued into 2021.  One notable feature in the rental sector in 2020 was the introduction of three Acts in response to Covid-19.  The Government&rsquo;s intention with these measures was to minimise the movement of people caused by the cessation of tenancies and thereby curtail the spread of disease, while also providing protections for tenants who were financially impacted by the pandemic.  We set out details of the legislation in the opening statement.  I will not go through it again.  I am sure members are familiar with it.<\/p><p> An immediate priority for RTB was operationalising these legislative measures to ensure they worked smoothly and effectively for all.  It was imperative to ensure that landlords, tenants and wider stakeholders understood the new measures and the resulting requirements of the regulatory framework and that they were made aware of the enhanced supports and services that were made available through the RTB to assist them.  Due to the evolving nature of the pandemic and the need for supports for the rental sector, six Acts affecting the RTB were passed between 2020 and 2021.  During this unprecedented time, the RTB maintained services across all contact and communication channels despite the rapid move to remote working.  There was no disruption to the RTB&rsquo;s registration compliance capability in terms of landlords or agents registering tenancies.  Of necessity, the RTB had to postpone in-person dispute hearings but quickly established replacement mechanisms to allow hearings to resume.  Backlogs in the processing of these cases were stabilised and we are currently focussed on the recovery of our timelines.  During 2020, there were nearly 270,000 customer service contacts, more than 2,700 mediation and adjudication hearings, and more than 200 tribunal hearings.  More than 130,000 registration applications were processed.<\/p><p> As mentioned earlier by the Comptroller and Auditor General about the financial statements, I confirm an error of omission of a single sentence on page 100 of the English version of the published 2020 report.  The relevant sentence was included in the Irish language version.  This was an oversight on our part for which we apologise.  The text has now been corrected on the report as published on the RTB website and we are making arrangements to have the corrected version laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> The committee will note from the accounts that the RTB has two primary sources of operating income, as noted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The funding enables the RTB to carry out its core functions and to develop the organisation as a capable and effective public interest regulator of the sector.  Tenancy registration income in 2020 was nearly &euro;11.7 million, which represented approximately 63% of the total.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Dunne like to conclude?

We need to take all appropriate steps to fully carry out our functions in the public interest.  As a regulator that maintains a registration database, it is very important that everything that is registerable is registered, that the registers are maintained to a high standard and updated regularly and that there are ongoing efforts to maintain the integrity of the registers.  That is absolutely the intent.  The maintenance of registers in practice can be a complex matter.  It is not an easy thing to do.  To give a kind of categorical declaration with regard to a register at any point in time is probably not something I would ever be in a position to do.  Putting in place all the necessary steps, arrangements, processes and assurances to give the very highest level of assurance we can, however, is something to which I am personally very committed as the incoming director.<\/p><p> We have programmes to update the register.  At each renewal date, we write to landlords, remind them of their registration requirements and prompt them to register their properties.  If anybody out there is not registering their properties, we should be taking steps in relation to that.  We have investigative and enforcement powers in this regard.  Failure to register is a criminal offence.  We also have powers to sanction landlords for improper behaviour, and failure to register is an improper behaviour.  Some of those powers are relatively new and still being tested by the RTB but we have powers in that regard.  It is very important that we use them to the full extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#B01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Mr. Byrne but having used up some of my time addressing the omission of a sentence, I want to move on.

As Mr. Byrne knows, most licence arrangements do not come under the remit of the RTB, which means that any tenant in a licensed property does not have the same protections.  I am particularly conscious of reports we are receiving in respect of rents in exchange for sexual favours.  I raise this issue because there has been coverage of it.  Many tenants are very vulnerable in the market.  Where there is no exchange of financial consideration in contractual terms, that leaves a tenant incredibly exposed.  This should not be happening.  What measures is the RTB taking?  Technically, that could be a licence arrangement; it is not a tenancy.  What steps is the RTB taking to move that from those de facto tenancies?  They often last longer than the recommended licence periods.  What steps is the RTB taking on that issue, particularly sex for rent, and also the issue of vulnerable tenants who are in a licence arrangement that morphs into a tenancy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#C00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645695000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>There are two parts to the Deputy's question.

If such a thing were to arise in relation to a tenancy registered with the RTB then, absolutely, we would look to see what action the RTB could take in that regard.  My understanding is that generally those kinds of arrangements relate to rent-a-room type provisions, which do not fall within the registration requirements of the RTB and, as such, do not directly fall to us.<\/p> <p>  Licences are a technical matter and different from tenancy.

This goes back to the 1930s before the RTB was even created and before the Residential Tenancies Act.  When the original Landlord and Tenant Acts were brought in, obviously, there were an awful lot of attempts to get outside the Landlord and Tenant Acts by creating licences rather than leases.  The courts look very unfavourably on any attempt to try to construct an arrangement between two parties that would ordinarily be a lease or tenancy but which is purported to be a licence.  The RTB follows the courts' findings.  The disposition of adjudicators and decision makers in the RTB would be to look very closely at anything like that and conclude that a duck is a duck.

I am head of finance in the RTB.  It is a very good question.  As the Deputy knows, the nature of annual registration is that landlords will have to register tenancies every year and there is a much higher throughput of volume.  Whereas the annual registration fee for a private tenancy will be &euro;40 compared with &euro;90 currently, our sense is that we will probably triple our volume.  Simple mathematics say that should generate more income for us.  It will not allow us to be self-funding based on our current projections.  If we had a full year of annual registrations, the high-water mark might be an increase of maybe &euro;2 million in our private residential income.  As the Deputy can see from our accounts, however, we spend not too shy of &euro;20 million or &euro;21 million per year.  In the reference year, 2020, it is &euro;18 million.  We will, therefore, continue to need to draw down Exchequer funding but our anticipation is that when annual registration gets bedded in, it will increase our private income.<\/p> <p>  I will make one more remark, which is really a comment on nuance.  One thing on which we do not have a good handle will be the customer behavioural aspects associated, first, with the requirement to register annually but also the fact that the price has come from &euro;90 down to &euro;40.

We have had lots of new legislation.  Our chair made reference to six pieces of new legislation, with three each in 2021 and 2020.  The public, if you like, and ultimately the State asks a lot of us and has facilitated that with incremental funding.  As long as the mandate stays as broad as it is, and it probably even needs to broaden in other areas, I anticipate we will continue to rely on State funding for several years to come.

We look at who is operating a particular tenancy and who the landlord is in a particular case.  This is partly to do with the earlier questions about our new technology platform.  That platform is about building and supporting a much more developed capability in relation to regulation than we would have had on our previous technology platforms.

I have examined the figures the RTB gave us.  In 2005, there were 50,000 landlords, while in 2014, there were approximately 160,000.

In fact, there was a slight increase since 2014 and it remained relatively flat during that period.  Am I correct in stating that the hard information Ms Gallagher has shows that there has been no exodus since 2014 but, rather, that there has been a slight increase in the number of landlords, and that the number has tripled since 2005?

She will soon have to pay a top-up given her rent is due to increase by 37%, although admittedly it has not increased for three years.  I have seen the notice.  She is terrified of complaining to the RTB because it will mean potentially losing the tenancy.  She does not live in a rent pressure zone.

I always ask people whether they pay a top-up and the answer, 99.9% of the time, is that they do.  We seem to be powerless.

In regard to registration enforcement in respect of which the board has to resort to the courts, the brief states that a District Court summons is issued for failure to comply with a second notice and that landlords are given ample opportunity to mend their hand before a summons to court is issued.  That is fair enough.  When the matter proceeds to court, the judge tends to look more favourably on the landlord who has since rectified the issue.  On most occasions, once a landlord engages with the RTB cases are adjourned to allow the landlord to register a tenancy.  In the instance where a landlord is fully compliant, the judge can direct that the probation Act be applied or a charitable donation be made.  There is a weakness there.  If I am a landlord, I can go for years without registering or until a complaint is made.  When a complaint is made to the RTB, following non-compliance with a second notice the matter enters the legal process through the court.  As the court date approaches, I can choose to register.  At that point, the worst that will happen is the judge will apply the probation Act or ask me to make a donation to the local branch of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  That is a very weak system.  There is no stick in terms of compelling landlords to register.  That seems to be a weakness in the system in terms of enforcing registration.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the RTB has to deal with the legislation and the hand it is dealt with in that regard but there is something in this for all of us.

In regard to build-to-rent, we know that is the intended purpose of the build, but does the RTB look at those particular projects when completed from the point of view of the occupancy rate?<\/p><p>It would seem to me an obvious one, given that new properties are being held back.  There is only one intention for those and that is they will be rented.  Is that something the RTB will be doing into the future or is that within its remit?<\/p><p> Does the RTB appreciate how the housing assistance payment, HAP, works from a tenant's perspective?  The Department puts limits on the amount one spends on rent.  If one applies for HAP and the cost of rent is &euro;500 higher than is permitted, the application will be refused.  Even if the rent is a fairly small amount higher than what is permitted, the application will be refused.  That is why these top-up payments are so important.  In 2017, 28% of applicants were topping up their payments and it is likely that percentage is higher now.  What is happening to the rest of it?  Is it not being reported to Revenue?  Does the RTB intend to liaise with the Department on the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#Q01600","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645695000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked a number of questions to which I will respond briefly.

They need to be resourced.  At the moment they receive some money from the Department  I believe it is a contra item.  I note that they get a payment from the Department for it.  Virtual inspections are fantasy land.  With a virtual inspection one can get answers over the phone, or a video or whatever.  I am not too sure of the detail around how it is done.  In fact, one needs to stand in the place - and I have stood in many of them - and have a look at it and speak with the tenant.  By all means, speak also with landlord.  The person or the people who are occupying a premises know best the faults in it.  With a virtual inspection, things can always look better in photographs.  In fact, we can all look better in photographs than we look in reality, whether we are on election posters or whatever, and until one is actually face-to-face it is the same with a premises and a residence.

It relates to reports in the media of alleged recordings of internal meetings of officials in the Department of Health.  The Secretary General states that they were made and released without the knowledge of those involved which has led to partial statements \"that were taken out of context and also contained some factual inaccuracies\".  The Secretary General goes on to correct some of those inaccuracies and to clarify the Department&rsquo;s position on some of the matters raised.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.

Can we ask for some documentary evidence of that?<\/p> <p>  On the prior adjustment, I do not know why this is addressed in this.  There is an acceptance that there is prior adjustment to the 2020 accounts.  He is saying it is in the range of &euro;10 million to &euro;100 million.  That seems to be quite a wide range.  It is strange to have addressed that at all.<\/p> <p>  The recruitment targets is an issue we will have to return to.  It may well be that we will deal with some of that with regard to, for example, mental health in the next couple of weeks.  Is the Department being set targets that it cannot meet?  Is the money being provided for targets it cannot meet?  If it cannot meet them, why not?  It may well be that there are a variety of reasons for that.  Not spending money is as big an issue where a service is required as spending money badly, so it is very much within our remit.  It is certainly something we need to take a serious look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#JJ00600","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>With regard to the mental health budget, there is obviously a huge need in that area but, in respect of capacity, a need to use it and to deliver the services where there appears to be a gap in that.  The article stated the additional money sought was reported to be &euro;10 million.  The Secretary General underlines in the letter, and seems very clear about it, that the actual sum initially sought by the HSE was &euro;35 million and I believe the final figure was &euro;37 million.  The question is whether we have, or if there is, a copy of correspondence from the HSE where the initial sum was &euro;35 million.  Perhaps we could look for that from the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  As regards the prior adjustment, one of the things when I saw this first in what was being published regarding the &euro;10 million and &euro;100 million is that it raises concerns not that we do not know the figure but that even at that point the Department or the HSE was not in a position to determine whether it was &euro;11 million or &euro;99 million.  It seems to be an awful long way apart.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the recruitment, we need to raise questions with the Department about recruitment and the issue of the budget providing for an extra 10,000.  It is the will of the Oireachtas, and the Oireachtas provided the budget.  However, we have this situation.  Is there a blockage or are there barriers?  Is the barrier here simply that the people with the skills are not available?  If they are not, the HSE and the Department of Health need to inform the Oireachtas.  Members of the Oireachtas need to know if the pipeline of trained staff is not coming through the third level institutions and so forth.  We can provide whatever money we wish but if we are unable to fill those positions with the necessary qualifications that is a problem.  The Oireachtas and obviously the Government have to take this on board and the measures to address this have to be put in place.<\/p> <p>  From what we have seen in the last fortnight in some of these revelations, if this is actually the case it would appear to confirm some of the issues many of us have been raising over a period of time now and that we must have more longer-term workforce planning in this country or we will be unable to reform the health service or provide the service.  We can supply whatever budget we wish but we will not be able to provide satisfactory services.  We should request the Department of Health to explain the challenge further.  Mr. Robert Watt mentions discussions between the Department and the HSE, and officials agreed that due to the current challenging recruitment environment 5,500 whole-time equivalents is a more achievable target for 2022.  It is worth noting that these recruitment targets are additional whole-time equivalents and do not include the replacement of existing staff who retire and leave during the year.  I noted that.  However, we need an explanation of the current challenging environment and we should seek that from the Department of Health.  Is it that we do not have the trained personnel coming through the institutions?  Is it that people who are trained are emigrating very quickly?  What percentage of them are emigrating and not taking up posts?  Also, is there problem with the posts being offered by the HSE?  Are they short-term contracts and is that the reason people choose to emigrate rather than to stay and work in these positions?  We will try to get clarity on that.<\/p> <p>  I call Deputy Devlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#JJ00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I agree with the comments of the previous speakers.

While the agreed budget was &euro;37 million, there was an additional &euro;10 million allocated.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the clarity in respect of recruitment, we know on this committee from across the country the challenge of recruitment that is faced by industry anyway, let alone in the public sector.

However, one matter which I would like to raise is a request we made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to include the remuneration of Accounting Officers in the appropriation accounts, beginning with the 2021 accounts.  We made this request in the interests of transparency and accountability and because State bodies are required to disclose similar information.  I understand that the information was requested by 11 February.  The secretariat followed up on 14 February to ask when the committee could expect a response but has not received a reply.  With the agreement of the committee, I ask the clerk to bring this matter to the Secretary General&rsquo;s attention and request that we have a response before next meeting on 10 March.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We had discussed this and agreed that it should be itemised in the accounts.  <\/p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  Next week, on 3 March we will have the final meeting in our series of housing-related meetings with Home Building Finance Ireland.  Please let the clerk know if there are any areas of particular interest arising from Home Building Finance Ireland's financial statements in order that a briefing can be requested in advance of the meeting and the witnesses can be prepared to engage on the areas of interest to the committee. <\/p> <p>  On 10 March, we will engage with the HSE regarding expenditure on mental health services, with a particular focus on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, expenditure.  Last week we agreed to request a detailed breakdown of that expenditure, as well as associated governance and oversight arrangements.  We also agreed to include expenditure in relation to the Owenacurra centre in Cork on the agenda for that meeting and briefing has been requested in that regard as well.  On the engagement with the HSE on 10 March, we had agreed that representatives of HSE estates would be present.<\/p> <p>  The week after that, 17 March, is a non-sitting week.  We had agreed to schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick on 24 March but while the president was available, the chancellor was not.  We had also sought information in relation to the Department of Health and the HSE&rsquo;s availability on that date but as neither are available, we need to agree how to proceed on 24 March. <\/p> <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, had been mentioned in the work programme in the context of the national retrofit schemes and SEAI grants.  Other bodies on the work programme include the Central Bank and Revenue Commissioners in relation to the outstanding chapter on assessment and collection of insurance compensation fund levies.  Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Body, IHRB, were also raised.  We have reviewed the last meeting with HRI with a view to drafting a report but there is little of significance that the committee has not already progressed through correspondence.  A further meeting with both bodies might provide additional material.  There is also the Department of Education and its outstanding special report on education and training boards, ETBs.  We need to confirm which we wish to go with on 24 March.  Are members happy that we would arrange a meeting with the SEAI?  It is accountable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022022400002#KK00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1645695000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I want to raise an area I had mentioned before, namely, the Dublin Dental Hospital.
