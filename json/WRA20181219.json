The enabling legislation was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997, which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised initially at 260 from 2002, and rising to 520 from April 2012, 15 years after its introduction in law.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that the actuarial value of the State Pension is estimated at over &euro;300,000, it is reasonable to require people who claim a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over 50 years of a working age life.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person does not satisfy this minimum contributions criterion, it is open to them to apply for a state pension (non-contributory).

I am very pleased therefore that the Employment Miscellaneous Provisions Bill will complete its passage this week and introduce important new protections - particularly for those workers in sectors where employment terms are perceived to be becoming more precarious.  <\/p>  <p>  As deputies will be aware, the issue of bogus or false self-employment was discussed during the debate on this Bill.  There exist legislative provisions prohibiting this practice.  For example, under sections 251 and 252 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, there are already offences specified in relation to misclassifying employment in order to avoid paying the correct social insurance contributions.  On conviction, fines of up to &euro;13,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years, or both, can ultimately be imposed.  <\/p>  <p>  Workers who have concerns in relation to their employment status also have recourse to the Department&rsquo;s SCOPE section.  This section determines employment status and the correct class of pay-related social insurance (PRSI).  The section applies a Code of Practice agreed with employers and trade unions in making its determinations.  Where misclassification of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class is determined and social insurance arrears are collected as required. This collection of arrears due in itself can impose a significant penalty on employers.<\/p>  <p>  Given the concerns expressed in this house and elsewhere regarding a perceived increase in the incidence of self-employment, the Department conducted a communications campaign covering radio, print and social media,  in relation to the issue of false self-employment during 2018 and will repeat this campaign again during 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has also increased the number of  employer inspections in recent months with a specific focus on detecting cases of false\/bogus self-employment.  Inspections are also undertaken jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Workplace Relations Commission.  Where evidence of non-compliance is detected, it is pursued.  <\/p>  <p>  Our increased level of inspections are resulting, in general, in a very low level of false or bogus self-employment.  This is in line with data published by the CSO which indicates that the share of employment accounted for by self-employment is falling while that accounted for by permanent full-time employment is increasing. It also accords with recent research on contingent employment published by the ESRI. <\/p>  <p>  Given the ongoing concerns, I have, nevertheless, set up a working group to review the Code of Practice for Determining Employment Status.  As part of the review, we will consider the feasibility of putting the Code on a legislative basis.

Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1st February 2017, a 6 year overall participation limit on the work scheme applies.  It should be noted that almost 50% of participants were on the RSS for over 10 years.  As a result, opportunities for new people to go on the scheme were very limited.  It was in this context that a maximum six year participation limit on the scheme was introduced for participants commencing on or after 1st February 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1st February 2017 will remain on the scheme, as long as they continue to remain eligible for the scheme.  The six year limit ensures that there will be a throughput of places available.  In addition income support continues to be available to eligible farmers and fishermen who are not on RSS in the form of Farm or Fish Assist.<\/p>  <p>  As the RSS is a supplementary income support scheme designed specifically for those whose income falls below a certain limit, an individual must continue  to satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme to be eligible to participate on the RSS.<\/p>  <p>  If a participant&rsquo;s circumstances change, a means test is undertaken to determine their new rate of payment.  The means assessment for RSS includes income that the participant and their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has in addition to any capital or property (except their own home).  Payment of RSS is not taken into account when assessing the weekly means.  If changes were made to the conditions to allow all participants receive the full rate of payment regardless of their means, it would in effect change the nature of the scheme of supporting farmers and farm families with low incomes. <\/p>  <p>  The rate paid to a participant on the RSS is equivalent to the participants underlying social welfare payment plus a top-up of &euro;22.50 subject to a minimum payment of &euro;220.50.  RSS participants in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s pension or disability allowance retain their payment and also receive a top-up payment which will bring the minimum weekly payment equal to &euro;220.50. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the recent Social Welfare Budget package for 2019, I increased the weekly personal rate for participants by &euro;5.00 with proportionate increases in weekly payments for qualified adult dependants with effect from March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind that warrants a means review, the details should be forwarded to my Department along with supporting documentary evidence.

However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which, amongst other things, will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit. <\/p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900063#WRB09200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":117,"content":"<p>Question No. 86 answered with Question No. 76.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":118,"content":"<p>Question No. 87 answered with Question No. 52.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":119,"content":"<p>Question No. 88 answered with Question No. 20.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900063#WRB09700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Expenditure","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900063#WRB09600"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[53583\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900063#WRB09700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the amount spent by his Department on public advertising and the purchase of external communications and publicity in 2018 by advertising campaign, including specific amounts on social media campaigns (details supplied) or other digital platforms; and the amount spent on public relations or other communications support in tabular form..

Results in the appraisal process have been released to candidates, along with information on the appeals process.

It is expected that the new roster will be established in January 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The process required an initial eligibility check of the 395 applications which were received by the application deadline.  Of these applications, 377 were deemed to have met the essential requirements listed in the Volunteer Information Booklet. <\/p>  <p>  The 377 applications went to stage 2 assessment, and were marked on the basis of the five competencies contained in the application form.  These were: Leadership and Team Work; Analysis and Decision-Making; Building Relationships and Communication Skills; Drive and Commitment; and, Knowledge and Expertise in the Area of Election Observation.<\/p>  <p>  Candidates were required to provide at least one relevant example under each competency, which demonstrated that the candidate would be suitable for membership of the roster.  The Election Observer Competency Framework attached to the application form provided guidance on the qualities the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would expect to see in an international election observer.  The competencies and qualities were based on the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation and associated Code of Conduct for International Election Observers, and also the roles and duties of EU and OSCE short and long term observers.<\/p>  <p>  Applications were assessed by a number of panels.  Panel members were provided with training in shortlisting best practice and in avoiding unconscious bias.  The marking process was calibrated by an independent external quality assurance service, ensuring cross-panel consistency in the marking approach. <\/p>  <p>  The process was run in accordance with the core principles contained in the Volunteer Information Booklet: probity; merit; best practice; fairness and consistency; and openness, accountability and transparency.  An appeals panel is available to meet in January if needed.  Should that need arise, the appeals process will be run in accordance with the same core principles.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade received a large number of very high quality applications.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance providers as to the pricing level which should apply in relation to specific categories of drivers.<\/p><p>I understand that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age of the driver, the age of the vehicle, the claims record, and the number of drivers.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market.  In addition, insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience. <\/p><p>In the case of taxi drivers, I understand that insurers take into account the nature of the taxi business, which involves driving for hire or reward extensively and in their view this has a much higher risk of injury claims from passengers and other road-users as a result. <\/p><p>My officials were unable to source appropriate data to facilitate a reliable comparison between the costs of motor insurance for taxis here compared to that for taxis in other EU countries.  However, it is not clear how useful such information would be as it will never be possible to make direct like-for-like comparison with most other EU Member States because of differences in areas such as legal systems and claims environments. <\/p><p>One area, however, which is relevant to the cost of insurance where a comparative exercise has been carried out is in relation to award levels.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) has recently completed its second and final report which indicated that soft tissue (whiplash) injury award levels in this jurisdiction run at a multiple of 4.4 times to that of the UK.  This significantly higher level of awards is undoubtedly a contributory factor to why the cost of insurance in this State is high.  The PIC has recommended that the Judicial Council when established should compile guidelines to take account of, amongst other things, its benchmarking exercise and it is hoped that when this is implemented it should have a positive impact on pricing. <\/p><p>In addition you should note that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on putting into place the measures proposed in its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance<\/i>.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and attracting potential new entrants to the market.  In this regard, I have been informed by my officials that Insurance Ireland has stated that there has been some increase in market capacity in relation to the provision of motor insurance for taxi drivers recently. <\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the most recent Central Statistics Office data (for November 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.7% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore it is appreciated that many people may still be seeing increases.  However, it is hoped that the improved stability in pricing will be maintained and that motor insurance premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Social Housing Provision","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[53858\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 138 of 11 December 2018, if he will provide a breakdown of the table 2 figures by local authority.","asker":"1222","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number of houses and apartments in each local authority area that have been directly financed by NAMA's residential funding programme since 2014 is set out in the table.<\/p><p>http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/webattachments.nsf\/0\/8456B10BA4771990802583680058699C\/$File\/ATTIA167.pdf?openelement<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Increases","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[53485\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if VAT on hairdressing services is increasing on 1 January 2019; if so, the amount by which; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>Services and goods currently applying at 9% VAT rate will increase to 13.5% from 1 January 2019. <\/p><p>As the supply of hairdressing services is currently applied at the 9% VAT rate, from 1 January 2019 the rate of VAT applying to the supply of hairdressing services will increase from 9% to 13.5%, an effective increase of 4.5%.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Money Laundering","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[53506\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the money laundering allegations at a bank (details supplied) have been investigated to ascertain if its branch here was part of suspicious or illegal activities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>In relation to the International Bank referred to in the Deputy's question I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) that its Irish Branch is supervised for compliance with the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 (the Act) by the CBI.

","asker":"1318","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>The move to real-time reporting is the most significant change to the PAYE system since its introduction more than fifty years ago.  The modernisation programme will bring improved accuracy and transparency for all stakeholders, including employers, employees and Revenue, while also significantly streamlining the entire administration process. <\/p><p>Since October 2016, when the then Minister for Finance launched the project, Revenue has worked extensively with all relevant stakeholders in a co-design approach, to ensure the new PAYE Modernisation reporting system reduces the administrative burden on employers to the greatest extent possible.  For example, one of Revenue&rsquo;s key design principles is that employer reporting should be seamlessly integrated into the business&rsquo; payroll process.  This will minimise the administrative burden on employers and allow their reporting obligations to Revenue to become a by-product of their payroll operation.  In addition, the project will lead to the abolition of the current employer reporting obligations via P30, P35, P45, P46 and P60 forms.  Revenue has advised me that employers have welcomed the abolition of these forms and the consequential reduction in the administrative burden. <\/p><p>All employers are currently obliged to calculate and make the correct statutory deductions from their employees&rsquo; salary payments each time they pay.  A significant number of employers, including small businesses, use payroll software to run their payroll and that will still be the case when PAYE Modernisation goes live on 1 January 2019.  I am aware that Revenue has engaged extensively with the payroll software industry to ensure, as far as possible, that the necessary changes to their systems will be ready on time.  Consequently, the processes for these employers before and after 1 January 2019 will be broadly similar.<\/p><p>For employers who do not use payroll software, Revenue is providing an easy-to-use process within the Revenue Online Service (ROS) to capture payroll data for each employee.  The process includes data screens that the employer will be obliged to complete for each employee every time a pay-run is completed (normally weekly, fortnightly or monthly).  The burden associated with this work will be offset to an extent by the abolition of the previously mentioned forms that operate under the current system.  In addition, the data required is in line with what employers are currently required to provide on an employee&rsquo;s payslip under employment law.  Also, it is also very important to note that there is no change to current PAYE payment dates under the Modernisation programme.<\/p><p>I know that Revenue is very conscious that some employers may experience difficulties in the early phases of PAYE Modernisation and has assured me that it will make every effort to assist where required.  For example, the Revenue Employer Helpdesk, which can be contacted at telephone number 01-7383638, will have significant additional resources available to meet customer demand and will operate for extended hours during the transitional period.  The details of the extended opening hours are set out at  <i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/ebrief\/2018\/no-2042018.aspx<\/i><\/p><p>Revenue has also confirmed that officials will be available to visit employers to assist with the transition should the need arise.  I am aware that Revenue has already carried out almost 80,000 customer service visits and phone calls to employers to support them in their preparation for PAYE Modernisation.  Revenue has also assured me that it is not the intention to impose sanctions such as interest and penalties during the early transitional months where employers do their best to comply.  However, Revenue always reserves the right to impose sanctions where there is clear non-engagement with the law. <\/p><p>Finally, while it is a matter for each employer to consider the impact that PAYE Modernisation will have on payroll arrangements and to put steps in place to ensure compliance with the new requirements, I would strongly encourage that they pro-actively engage with the changeover. I would particularly recommend that they review the very detailed PAYE Modernisation material that is available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie\/pmod174<\/i>or the recently published <i>Employer&rsquo;s Guide to PAYE<\/i>at <i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/ebrief\/2018\/no-2102018.aspx.<\/i>The new Guide is a comprehensive manual, effective from 1 January 2019, covering all aspects of employer&rsquo;s obligations relating to the operation of PAYE and the new reporting requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[53605\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the preparations that have been undertaken to date by the Revenue Commissioners for Brexit; the details of same under each different Brexit scenario; the steps that will be taken by the Revenue Commissioners between December 2018 and the end of March 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that its Brexit contingency plans are progressing well.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s priority to date has been on upgrading relevant IT systems to have the most advanced systems possible to support and facilitate smooth and efficient trade flows.

Such authorisations and simplifications facilitate legitimate trade to operate in the most efficient way possible.

Full details of the relief, including the terms and conditions that apply, are set out on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions\/education\/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education\/index.aspx.<\/i><\/p><p>Finally, as with all such reliefs, my Department regularly reviews tax expenditure measures.

I have therefore consulted with the Central Bank on the matters raised by the Deputy.<\/p><p>Latent defect insurance is a form of insurance taken out in respect of specific new-build premises to provide cover in the event of an inherent defect in the design, workmanship or materials becoming apparent after practical completion.  It is commonly sold to developers when constructing housing developments and is generally valid for an extended period of time after completion, typically ten years.  The Central Bank has advised me that the prudential returns of insurers do not provide a breakdown of information at this product level, and therefore it is not possible to ascertain the number of companies providing latent defects insurance in Ireland.<\/p><p>In relation to number of actual properties covered by the 1,595 latent defect and structural warranty insurance policies sold by Alpha, the Central Bank has informed me that the exact breakdown of properties covered by the policies is not currently known.  The Central Bank continues to work closely with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) and the insolvency administrator in respect of Alpha Insurance DAC (Alpha). <\/p><p>The Central Bank has advised that the claims handler (BCR Legal Group Limited) confirmed in September that it had written to the developers who had purchased these latent defects policies.  The Bank also indicated that BCR were due to write to all homeowners affected by the liquidation of Alpha by the end of September 2018. <\/p><p>The Danish Guarantee Fund continues to provide country-specific updates of the latent defects policies on <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has also published information in relation to Alpha, which it will update if further information becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD03600"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[53735\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900065#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he expects to introduce legislation on limited partnerships; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>The Investment Funds Industry has been a successful and significant element of the Irish financial services landscape for many years.

However it is important to note that this surplus has yet to fully crystallise. Its realisation depends on the success of NAMA's ongoing deleveraging, its Dublin Docklands SDZ programme and residential funding programme.  These activities must be completed for the expected surplus to be earned.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, the NAMA Board approved an Entity Return on Investment (&lsquo;EROI&rsquo;) target benchmark of 20%. The projected return as at end-2017 was 35%. The EROI benchmark is calculated based on the comparison of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus position with NAMA&rsquo;s initial investment, as adjusted to exclude the &euro;5.6 billion in State Aid which NAMA was required to pay to the Participating Institutions as part of the loan acquisition price.<\/p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Exchequer once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with EUROSTAT rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules. However, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900066#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Code of Practice on the Transfer of Mortgages","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900066#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[53747\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900066#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration has been given to placing the code of practice on the transfer of mortgages on a statutory footing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>The Code of Practice on the Transfer of Mortgages was introduced in 1991.

For instance, I understand, based on reports published from various sources including the European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA) and EU Commission, that there are, 26 Insurance Guarantee Schemes (IGSs) (or similar schemes) established in 20 Member States: eight IGSs operating on the basis of the host-country principle, eight operating on the home-country principle and eight schemes with a combination of both.  The remaining two schemes are undefined.  In addition, IGSs do not exist in the following EEA Member States: Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden. <\/p><p>These differences in national Insurance Guarantee Schemes (IGSs), together with differences in insolvency laws, have led to a situation where policyholders across or even within the same Member States are not protected to the same extent in liquidation.  Therefore it has been difficult to arrive at a common EU position in relation to IGSs.  However, there has been considerable efforts on the issue, including a number of reports and initiatives in recent years: <\/p><p>- A 2010 Commission white paper on the introduction of an EU wide framework of Insurance Guarantee Systems.  No significant progress was made on this framework subsequently as the development of Solvency II was the priority piece of work at the time.<\/p><p>- A 2015 Commission discussion paper on the possibility of introducing a recovery and resolution regime for insurance undertakings which could include an Insurance Guarantee Scheme.<\/p><p>- In 2017 the Commission issued a questionnaire to all Member States seeking information on Recovery and Resolution including experiences with failures and near-failures of insurers.<\/p><p>- The European Systemic Risk Board published a report &ldquo;Recovery and Resolution for the EU insurance sector: a macro prudential perspective&rdquo; in August 2017. The Central Bank of Ireland was represented on the drafting team.<\/p><p>- EIOPA published an Opinion to Institutions of the European Union on the Harmonisation of Recovery and Resolution Frameworks for (Re) Insurers (July 2017).<\/p><p>- Work is also underway at an EIOPA level, where a project group has been set up to examine more broadly recovery and resolution within insurance and in relation to Insurance Guarantee Schemes, a discussion paper was published on this topic.<\/p><p>In addition, the Deputy should note that the European Commission proposed an amendment to the Motor Insurance Directive which would oblige member states to set up Insurance Guarantee Schemes to cover the cost of insolvent motor insurers.  I support this measure and my officials are actively participating to ensure that the legislation is strong and in the best interests of Ireland, given the large insurance industry here and our previous experience with insolvent inward-Freedom of Services (FoS) insurers.<\/p><p>Finally, while the provision of cross-border insurance is an essential part of the Single market, and it is acknowledged that there are obvious difficulties which arise when an insurer fails, it should be noted that Solvency II is not a 'no-failure' regime as it would not be possible to build a viable system that provides a cast iron guarantee that no insurer will ever fail.  Consequently it is important that EU supervisors properly and consistently supervise the insurers that they authorise, and that there is greater communications between supervisors across the EU about their respective companies conducting cross-border business.  You should also be aware that as part of the ongoing review of the European Supervisory architecture, there is a proposal to further improve cross-border co-operation and communication through the strengthening of Cross-Border Collaboration Platforms.  These already operate on an ad-hoc basis, however this proposal would ensure a more formal structure is put in place where an insurer is doing a lot of cross border business.  This would therefore give the supervisors of countries into which insurance is written a greater insight into how the business is being conducted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900067#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[53956\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900067#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the law was changed governing the Danish guarantee fund to deal with insurance company failures in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>At the outset I would like to say that as there is currently no EU harmonised approach to insurance guarantee schemes.

If enacted, this Bill will provide the legislative underpinning for the Rainy Day Fund, which will formally be known as the \"National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund\".  However, the timing of commencement is contingent on the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  The Rainy Day Fund is part of a suite of measures to help increase the State's resilience to external economic shocks.  In particular, it will provide an economic buffer which can be drawn on in the event of a sharp downturn and mitigate its effects.<\/p>  <p>  My intention, as outlined in Budget 2019, is to seed the Fund with an initial transfer of &euro;1.5 billion from the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. I have provided for Exchequer transfers of &euro;500 million per annum from 2019 to 2023.  This will see the Fund grow to around &euro;4 billion by end 2023. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Bill will provide the possibility of placing windfall tax or other receipts in the Fund, where the D&aacute;il by resolution so authorises.  The projection of &euro;4 billion by the end of 2023 is contingent on a number of assumptions such as that there is no event requiring a draw-down over the period; that there are no windfall receipts placed in the Fund over the period; and that there is no significant event during the period requiring use of the in-year contingency reserve. <\/p>  <p>  I should explain that the in-year contingency reserve is intended to operate as a potential carve-out from the annual &euro;500 million allocation to the Fund. Where, as a result of a natural or other disaster, Government incurs unforeseeable additional expenditure to mitigate the effects of that event, the payment into the Rainy Day Fund in that year may be reduced by an amount of up to that additional expenditure.  This is not intended to replace or substitute for prudent budgeting by central and local government and their agencies: it is an additional facility to provide flexibility to mitigate a significant event or consequences in excess of those which can be dealt with under prudent contingency planning and budgeting.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to D&aacute;il and Seanad scheduling, I hope it will be possible to establish the Fund as early as possible in 2019, and to make the initial transfer from the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund shortly thereafter. In order to ensure meaningful availability of the in-year contingency reserve, I intend that the annual transfers to the Fund will not as a rule be made until close to the end of the financial year.  This will ensure that the transfer is not made until after the in-year financial consequences of a serious event have crystallised.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to debating my detailed proposals at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900067#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900067#WRF03300"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[53963\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900067#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the national claims information database will be fully up and running; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018, which underpins the proposed Database, is scheduled for Committee Stage and remaining stages in the Seanad tomorrow (20 December 2018).  <\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the Bill will be approved by the Seanad which will enable it to be enacted by the end of the year.

Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers within each sector. My Department is committed to supporting the increased registration of apprentices and the expansion of the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy. The 2019 budget allocation for apprenticeship training is &euro;142m which represents an increase of over 16% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;122m. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to expanding the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy. Arising from two calls for apprenticeship proposals issued by the Apprenticeship Council in 2015 and 2017, 17 new apprenticeships have now been developed in a range of new occupations, including financial services, engineering, ICT, hospitality, logistics and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway throughout 2019 in a variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture.  These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs of our economy.  All of these apprenticeships are national programmes that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.<\/p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally during 2017 with 4,508 at year end, which represents a 20% increase on 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, education and training providers are also engaging positively with the Regional Skills Fora in order to address skills deficits in their regions. This engagement informs the planning for education and training programmes, including apprenticeship.<\/p>  <p>  Apprenticeships have a balanced regional spread and the delivery of Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship will bring real opportunities for learners and employers throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900069#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900070#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[53487\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900070#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the school redevelopment project at a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":412,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, a building project for the school in question is included in my Department&rsquo;s Construction Programme.<\/p><p>My Department is currently liaising with the Patron of the school in the context of additional information that the Department requires to progress the proposed project.<\/p><p>When this information has been received and considered, my Department will be in further contact with the school relating to the next steps to be taken to further progress the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900070#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[53526\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900070#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a decision will be made on a new primary school in Ashbourne, County Meath.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).

Through the 6 year Capital Programme, the investment plan is about looking to the future and ensuring that our school infrastructure is well prepared to accommodate our growing school population.  The programme also addresses the requirements of many schools which are in need of upgrading and refurbishment, although they may not be experiencing significant demographic pressure.<\/p>  <p>  The projects under the capital programme will provide 19,000 new primary schools places and 43,000 new post-primary places.  While the Programme relates to major projects capital funding for smaller projects, such as the addition of a classroom etc., is dealt with on an ongoing basis through the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie, and this information is updated regularly.  In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may be viewed on the website.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is designed to allow schools, on a devolved funding basis, to carry out necessary improvement and refurbishment works that will upgrade existing school facilities.  Under 2016-2017 almost &euro;117 million has been approved to date under the Summer Works Scheme, in respect of over 940 school projects in categories 1 - 9.  Details of the successful school applicants are published on my Department's website www.education.ie.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the remaining applications under Category 10, which relate to external works such as upgrade and resurfacing of yards and car parking, these applications require more detailed analysis. It is intended to undertake this analysis in 2019 with a view to enabling approved applications proceed in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, for primary schools, the Minor Works grant allows schools to undertake improvement works in full or in part, as the grant allows, without prior application to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The recent launch of Project Ireland 2040 included an announcement of a major package of investment in education for the next decade with the school building budget increasing by 70%.  This investment will provide for the continued increase in demographics while also allowing for a greater focus on refurbishment and upgrading of existing school stock.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is committed to putting in place a grant scheme similar to the Minor Works Grant in place at post-primary level over the lifetime of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900070#WRJ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900070#WRJ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[54018\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900070#WRJ05600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools established in temporary accommodation and that have remained in temporary accommodation for five years or more and for which a permanent site has not been identified.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is being collated by my Department and will be forwarded to him when compiled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900070#WRJ05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments Data","counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900071#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":464,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[54019\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900071#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children who have been assigned a school place as a result of not having secured a place in primary school before six years of age between 2011 and November 2018, by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In the circumstances it is not possible to give any meaningful average processing time per application.<\/p><p>Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee being awaited, or the applicant not engaging with the office.  In some instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.  In other instances issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered before a final decision is taken.  <\/p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.<\/p><p>INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants to enable queries to be dealt with, including the progress of their application.

The shared assessment of the threat in Northern Ireland is that it remains 'Severe' (that is to say, a terrorist attack is highly likely).  The dissident paramilitary groups continue to focus their efforts primarily on targeting members of the security forces in Northern Ireland, as evidenced tragically in recent years by the murders of NI Prison Officers Alan Black and Adrian Ismay, and a number of attempts to murder PSNI constables, including in July in Derry when a number of shots were fired at the PSNI.   <\/p>  <p>  Garda activities to disrupt and prevent actions by republican paramilitary groups continue without cease.

The International Protection Appeals Tribunal, (IPAT), considers appeals against IPO refusals of international protection and the Tribunal is also independent in the performance of its functions <\/p>  <p>  The IPO was established on 31 December 2016 following the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 providing for the introduction of a single application procedure for people seeking international protection.

This follows three months of detailed consideration by my Department of the report's findings and recommendations and consultations with the Garda Commissioner, the policing oversight bodies , other Government Departments and agencies. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission's vision as endorsed by Government is for a modern, highly professional, human rights-based police service, working closely and collaboratively with communities and other agencies to keep communities safe and prevent harm. I and my Government colleagues are convinced that this is the right vision to maintain and enhance public trust in policing, to address current challenges and to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet future challenges.  <\/p>  <p>  I was also pleased to launch, with the Garda Commissioner, a high level implementation plan \"A Policing Service for the Future\" which sets out the approach to implementation. It will be overseen by the Implementation Group on Policing Reform (IGPR) which has Ms Helen Ryan, former member of the Commission, as its independent Chair. The IGPR is supported by a dedicated Programme Office in the Department of the Taoiseach. <\/p>  <p>  The Plan, which was prepared with the input of the IGPR sets out an ambitious but realistic four year work programme for the implementation of the recommendations. This timescale is in line with the Commission's own recommendations.  I would refer the Deputy to www.gov.ie\/policingreform for a copy of the Plan. <\/p>  <p>  My Department along with the Commissioner will be centrally involved in the implementation work.  <\/p>  <p>  The Plan includes the preparation by my Department  of a Policing and Community Safety Bill to provide, amongst other matters, for a new coherent governance, oversight and accountability framework for policing as recommended by the Commission. <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of some concern that the proposals risk diluting the current level of external scrutiny.  Following detailed consideration of the concerns, including the dissenting views of the two members of the Commission to whom the Deputy refers, I am satisfied that the proposals are a coherent response to what is currently a complex system of external oversight that acts to the detriment of accountability on the part of individuals and the Garda organisation itself.  Taken as a whole, the suite of proposals will ensure the achievement of the complementary objectives of effective external oversight of policing and strong internal governance in line with best practice.<\/p>  <p>  I am also satisfied that it is appropriate that the Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Board be given responsibility for senior appointments, subject to normal public service recruitment and promotion standards being applied.

The European Commission leads on these matters as competence on trade issues is vested in the Commission under the Common Commercial Policy of the EU Treaties.  <\/p>  <p>  TRQs reflect the maximum quantity of the imports of a given category of goods on which a country member of the WTO - the EU in our case - pledges to charge low import duties rates.<\/p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU has implications beyond the bilateral relationship between the EU and the UK, in particular with regard to their commitments under the Agreement establishing the WTO.  When the EU accepted the WTO Agreement and the Multilateral Trade Agreements in 1994, the schedule of concessions and commitments that was Annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 for the European Communities was thereby simultaneously annexed for the UK.  As a consequence of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, the EU&rsquo;s existing quantitative commitments, notably the TRQs, require adjustment. <\/p>  <p>  Given the time limits imposed on this process by the negotiations on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Union, it is possible that agreements may not be concluded with all WTO Members concerned in relation to all of the Tariff Rate Quotas before Regulation (EC) No 32\/2000 (which provides and administers the EU&rsquo;s TRQs) ceases to apply to the United Kingdom.  In view of the need to ensure legal certainty and the continuous smooth operation of imports under the TRQs to the Union and the United Kingdom it is necessary for the EU to be able to proceed unilaterally to the apportionment of the TRQs.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation - COM (2018) 312 &ndash; on 22 May 2018 - which seeks to ensure that in the absence of such agreement, the EU can nevertheless proceed with the apportionment of the TRQs by modifying the WTO tariff concessions and that the Commission is given the necessary powers to consequently amend the relevant EU provisions on the opening and implementation of the relevant TRQs. Following its formal adoption by the European Parliament and the Council, the Regulation will enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The new TRQs will apply to the UK as and from the day after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. However, the existing TRQ regime (Council Regulation No 32\/2000) will apply to the UK during the transition period in the event that the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by all parties and enters into force. <\/p>  <p>  The products which have TRQs attached are primarily agricultural and fishery products (including specific beef, swine, sheep, poultry, dairy, fruit, vegetables, wheat, maize, rice and fish products), and a small number of industrial products (including specific wood, silicon, glass, flax and fructose products). <\/p>  <p>  The methodology applied was to first determine the United Kingdom&rsquo;s usage share for each individual tariff rate quota over a recent representative three year period (2013-2015). This usage is then applied to the entire scheduled tariff rate quota volume, taking into account any under fill, to arrive at the UK's share of a given TRQ. The EU&rsquo;s share then consists of the remainder of the TRQ in question. This means the total volume of a given tariff rate quota is not changed (that is EU-27 volume = current EU-28 volume minus United Kingdom volume). The full product list including the EU share in quota is contained in the Regulation Annex.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has actively engaged with the discussions to date on this matter at EU level and has supported the Commission&rsquo;s approach on the basis that it aims to maintain as close as possible to the status quo regarding the level of market access to the EU-27 after the UK's withdrawal.  In this regard, we have prioritised the need to minimise disruption to trade as the UK leaves the EU and the importance of maintaining the existing levels of market access, which is the intention of the European Commission, insofar as the TRQ regime is concerned.  Ireland was one of a number of Member States who sought to enhance the consultation requirements for the European Commission with Member States in the apportionment process and we were successful in that regard. This gave us assurances that any unintended consequences of the proposed approach, given the fluidity of the overall Brexit process, would be discussed by Member States at the relevant Committee, in particular, the Trade Policy Committee, where Ireland's representative is an official of my Department.

This is delivered at no cost to the company. <\/p><p>- The Local Enterprise Office&rsquo;s (LEOs) &lsquo;Lean for Micro Programme&rsquo; which offers clients the opportunity to incorporate Lean business principles to improve performance and effectiveness. <\/p><p>- The LEO&rsquo;s &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro Enterprises&rsquo;, to support businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling them to develop new market opportunities outside of the EU.<\/p><p>- InterTrade Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; vouchers &ndash; worth &euro;2,250 - to enable SMEs to purchase specialist advice on customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues, specifically in relation to Brexit.<\/p><p>- On 28 March this year, I, along with Minister Donohoe and Minister Creed, launched the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme with the European Investment Bank Group and the SBCI. This scheme provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses. <\/p><p>In allocating my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2019, I stepped up our response to Brexit, basing my decisions on both an extensive body of research and direct feedback from the sector. <\/p><p>In addition to the above measures, the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme will help businesses invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment and will be available early in 2019. The scheme, which is<b><\/b>jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine provides up to &euro;300m to support capital investment by business and offers loan terms of 8 to 10 years. <\/p><p>In the 2019 budget I have allocated &euro;8m extra for Brexit staffing &amp;amp; supports across enterprise and regulatory agencies in order to prepare Irish businesses for Brexit; the roll-out of customs training through Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland; and, &euro;1m additional funding for InterTrade Ireland. <\/p><p>At the beginning of this month, Enterprise Ireland, working with the Revenue Commissioners, launched an online &ldquo;Customs Insights&rdquo; course designed for Irish businesses dealing with customs for the first time. The course will give learners a firm understanding of customs, the implications for their business and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the uncertainty of Brexit, there are several areas where firms can take immediate action to prepare. I would ask firms now to take heed and to take action.  My advice to businesses is to:<\/p><p>- Be alert to your supply chains and any possible disruption that might arise. <\/p><p>- Be alert to the potential for new customs procedures that might be required and the possible application of new tariffs and quotas in certain areas<\/p><p>- Be alert to certification, standards and licensing issues. <\/p><p>- Be alert to currency fluctuations. <\/p><p>- Be alert to the State supports and loans schemes available from Government, including through Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and InterTrade Ireland.<\/p><p>The European Commission and Government have also made known their intention imminently to set out additional information relating to Brexit contingency planning for a no-deal scenario, including as regards necessary legislation that will be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900073#WRM04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":621,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900073#WRM04700"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[53664\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900073#WRM04800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of applicants and participants in all Brexit schemes and supports provided by her Department or agencies under the remit of her Department; and the amount allocated and expended to each such scheme in each year since being established in tabular form.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":623,"content":"<p>My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit.

It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) comes from existing IDA client companies. Site visits nevertheless do represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that investors consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Site visits are collated by the IDA on a county-by-county basis only and are released every quarter.

In the first three quarters of 2018, there were a further seven such visits by prospective investors.  <\/p>  <p>  The IDA has constructed an Advanced Technology Building in Mayo, located in Castlebar.

Members of the Traveller community are recognised in this strategy as being one of the priority groupings most vulnerable to suicide. <\/p>  <p>  To address this issue, targeted mental health and stigma reduction campaigns are in development for the Travelling community. To date, this has involved focus group testing of the national mental health Little Things campaign messaging with traveller groups. Based on this process, the National Office for Suicide Prevention will further develop the communication campaigns using appropriate messaging and media channels for this target population group. The Samaritans (funded under the Connecting for Life strategy) are also working at a local level to promote their service to this priority group. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE and Primary Care Social Inclusion currently funds Exchange House Ireland to deliver targeted health programmes. This includes two suicide prevention projects targeting the Traveller Community; the National Traveller Suicide Prevention Service and Travelling to Wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  Exchange House Ireland provides a range of services and supports to approximately 8,000 Travellers annually. The National Office for Suicide Prevention commissioned a review of the projects (2016-2017) in line with its goal to build the evidence base in support of targeted initiatives for priority groups, and to further inform its role in funding suicide prevention initiatives and establish how the existing projects align with the Connecting for Life strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality led on the development of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy. The strategy provides a set of specific actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma. A number of cross&ndash;cutting themes emerged in the consultation process for the strategy such as accommodation, employment, health and education. The strategy, published in June 2017, includes agreed actions aiming to improve the health of travellers.<\/p>  <p>  The Oversight Group working on the refresh of the Vision for Change national mental health policy proposes that policy changes will benefit all those engaging with mental health services. The Terms of Reference for the Group place a particular emphasis on social inclusion and the needs of vulnerable groups, including the Traveller community, which will be incorporated into the final report with a focus on reducing stigma and discrimination.

the regulation and audit of their use; the extent of use of these devices in Ireland and the availability of services for women affected by mesh-associated complications, including through the tabling of several Parliamentary Questions.  <\/p><p>In responding to these questions and in recognition of the complexity of the matters arising, I requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report for me on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p><p>a) the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology; and<\/p><p>b) an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures. <\/p><p>The Report, entitled The Use of Uro-gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures, has now been presented to me and was published on the 21 November 2018 on the Department of Health website.<\/p><p>The report provides a brief background description of mesh implant devices, including the complications associated with their use; and summarises international best practice in the use of mesh procedures in the clinical management of SUI and POP. A range of recommendations for action by the HSE in collaboration with other stakeholders is identified, to provide assurance that the use of mesh implants and the care of women requiring aftercare in Irish hospitals is in line with emerging evidence and best practice internationally, based on expert advice received and review of international experience. <\/p><p><b>Methodology:<\/b><\/p><p>Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report has been informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown, by the women that met with me and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were harrowing, deeply personal experiences. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, have not been formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, as described in Section 2, a number of women whose procedures were postponed made representations to the Department expressing concern at the impact that this has on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.<\/p><p><b>Report Findings:<\/b><\/p><p>The report makes a number of overall findings, in addition findings are presented which relate to informed consent, aftercare of women with complications, clinical and professional issues and information issues. The findings are:<\/p><p><b>Overall Findings:<\/b><\/p><p>Mesh implant devices are certified as compliant with relevant European Union (EU) legislation and no market action against mesh devices for the treatment of SUI or POP has been taken by any of the European device regulatory competent authorities.  <\/p><p>There is an extensive evidence base supporting (i) the use of the mid-urethral sling (MUS) devices in the treatment of SUI and (ii) the use of abdominally placed mesh in the management of POP. A significant majority of patients benefit greatly from these procedures, with reduced long-term complications and improved functional outcomes compared to non-mesh procedures. <\/p><p>Mesh procedures should be performed by trained personnel, in patients who are appropriately selected and counselled and when appropriate multidisciplinary expertise and clinical governance mechanisms are in place.<\/p><p>Transvaginal placement of mesh for the treatment of POP is no longer regarded as appropriate first line treatment. Its use is restricted by clinical guidance in some jurisdictions. Regulatory restrictions on its use are in place in Australia and New Zealand.<\/p><p>Mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p><p>Many other health systems, including the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and the Netherlands have implemented specific measures in recent years to ensure appropriate use of mesh procedures in the treatment of SUI and POP and to ensure appropriate aftercare for women suffering mesh complications.<\/p><p><b>Informed Consent:<\/b><\/p><p>As would be usual with many surgical conditions, standardised information resources were not available at national level to ensure that all patients receive consistent information about the benefits and risks of mesh devices, to advise of other treatment options and to support informed consent processes.<\/p><p>Many women reported that they were not informed of other treatment options; they had not been informed that their surgeries involved the use of mesh; they were not informed of mesh complications; and they were not made aware of the difficulties associated with mesh removal or with the treatment of long-term mesh complications. <\/p><p>Aftercare of Women with Complications<\/p><p>Structured treatment or referral pathways were not evidently in place for the minority of women requiring specialist, multidisciplinary care for serious complications following mesh surgery. <\/p><p>Some women reported considerable difficulty in accessing timely, compassionate and appropriate specialist aftercare for complications. <\/p><p>Some women reported that individual clinicians responded to their personal concerns in an inappropriate manner which greatly added to their distress. Women also reported feeling that they were not believed, or that their clinicians minimised or did not understand the severity of their complications.  <\/p><p>Clinical and Professional Issues <\/p><p>Governance mechanisms are not in place at national level to provide assurance that mesh surgeries are carried out in accordance with agreed international best practice and clinical guidance. <\/p><p>There is no mandated professional clinical guidance at national level to guide the use of mesh implants in the management of SUI or POP or to guide the management of women with complications. <\/p><p>Communication mechanisms currently in place at national level between the HPRA, healthcare providers and professional bodies do not provide assurance that the findings and recommendations of safety reviews such as those circulated by the HPRA in recent years regarding mesh implants are systematically analysed and acted upon where appropriate.<\/p><p>Information<\/p><p>There are significant gaps in knowledge about current practice in Ireland regarding the use of urogynaecological mesh implants. <\/p><p>Routinely collected clinical information at national level does not provide the capacity for monitoring or audit of mesh surgeries for the treatment of SUI and POP.<\/p><p>Based on international experience, there is under-reporting of adverse events relating to mesh surgeries by clinicians to both the HPRA and to the National Incident Management System (NIMS) operated by the State Claims Agency (SCA). <\/p><p>Recommendations<\/p><p>Nineteen recommendations in total are identified throughout the report in response to the findings above:<\/p><p>Patient Information and Consent &ndash; 2 recommendations<\/p><p>Aftercare for Women Suffering Complications &ndash; 5 recommendations<\/p><p>Clinical and Professional Recommendations &ndash; 8 recommendations<\/p><p>Information Recommendations &ndash; 5 recommendations<\/p><p>These include recommendations about the development of patient information and informed consent materials to ensure appropriate patient selection and counselling, ensuring clinical and professional standards of practice are met by ensuring that all surgeons have undergone appropriate surgical professional training and ensuring that appropriate multidisciplinary expertise is available in units carrying out mesh procedures, the development of clinical guidance for the management of SUI and POP, the development of information resources to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices and to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications. <\/p><p>Full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations will provide significant assurance that all patients presenting for treatment for SUI and POP and all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, patient centred care in accordance with accepted evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms. <\/p><p>Actions to date<\/p><p>A number of important interim system actions to address the safety and effectiveness of mesh implant use have been progressed in advance of completion of the report.<\/p><p>1.Pause on all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures<\/p><p>On July 24th, 2018, the HSE was requested by the CMO to pause all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  The request to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures was considered proportionate and necessary to address public and patient concern about the ongoing safety of mesh devices as comprehensively as possible. <\/p><p>2.Development of patient information and consent materials<\/p><p>Prior to this request, in May 2018, the HSE had been requested to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications.<\/p><p>3.Learning Notice on mesh devices <\/p><p>A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the National Women and Infants&rsquo; Health Programme (NWIHP) on 26th June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website. <\/p><p>Acute Hospitals Division<\/p><p>4.Synthetic Mesh Devices Group<\/p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups, to advise on and progress all the interim recommendations as advised to the HSE in May 2018 and in July 2018.  To ensure that the spectrum of views of women affected by mesh safety concerns is represented, the three patient representatives include Ms Melanie Power, representative of Mesh Survivors Ireland; as well as a woman who has had a successful outcome of mesh surgery for the treatment of SUI and a woman who is on the waiting list for surgery (currently paused).<\/p><p>I am informed that a work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications including access to specialist diagnostic facilities such as translabial scanning is being progressed through this Group.  The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad. <\/p><p>Next Steps<\/p><p>As requested by the CMO in July 2018, the pause in the use of mesh procedures for the management of SUI and POP in HSE-funded hospitals is ongoing, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations.  <\/p><p>The Department of Health has written to the HSE to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, working in conjunction with other stakeholders. <\/p><p>As promised at my meeting with Mesh Survivors Ireland on June 14th 2018, I provided the group with a copy of the CMO&rsquo;s Report on the date of publication and a date will be arranged for a further meeting with the group in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900077#WRQ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":832,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900078#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":833,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[53852\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900078#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the tender contract for private ambulance services expired in September 2015 following an extension of three years;

Considerable work has been undertaken on the project since April 2017 when Government gave the green light for the construction of the hospital. Enabling works on the main hospital site are complete and Phase A construction works (substructure works on the main site), which commenced in October 2017, are also now nearing completion.  Following yesterday's decision, the Phase B 7-storey above ground works will begin early next year. Development is also well advanced on the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres.  Works at Connolly are on target for practical completion of the building in Spring 2019 with the opening scheduled for July 2019.  Works at Tallaght are underway with a target handover date of July 2020, and the main hospital to be completed in 2022. The hospital will facilitate the implementation of a new model of care that will have a profound impact on all paediatric services once the new hospital is open. <\/p>  <p>  At an early stage in the process, it was determined that the traditional method of procurement was not suitable or realistic for a project of this size and complexity. Accordingly, the contract is subject to a two-stage process with stage one consisting of a scope refinement and value engineering process, based upon tendered rates, to finalise the Phase B works (above ground). This approach allowed the early phases of work to commence on site while also allowing for the detail of later phases to be finalised and agreed.  This approach brings issues on cost to the fore much earlier in the life of the project than is the case where traditional procurement approaches are deployed.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the evaluation by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in early 2017 of main construction tenders and the selection of preferred contractors, the final cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the NPHDB is responsible was &euro;983m.  Following the completion of the second stage of the two-stage tender procurement process, the project cost is now at &euro;1,433 million, an increase of &euro;450 million.  <\/p>  <p>  Of the &euro;450m additional costs, construction costs account for &euro;319m. The balance of &euro;131m, which includes &euro;50m in VAT, relates to costs associated with staff, consultants, planning, design team fees, risk\/contingency, and Management Equipment Service. <\/p>  <p>  As I have already stated the increased cost is a matter of great concern and I have made it clear that Phase B of the construction project must be delivered within budget and timescale.   Accordingly, there will be an independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum, the contributory factors and associated responsibilities so that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will be required to provide on-going assurance to the HSE, Department of Health and Government that Phase B of the project is being delivered within budget and timescale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":956,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Payments","counter":955,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT02300"},{"type":"question","counter":956,"qnumday":419,"qnumall":"[53492\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of TAMS payments that are outstanding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":957,"content":"<p>The TAMS II Scheme has been very successful to date with over 17,623 approvals issued to farmers.

Notwithstanding these events there was a return in the third quarter of the year to more normal climatic conditions which benefitted the agriculture sector in terms of a late season grass growth. <\/p>  <p>  My priority throughout the year has been to support measures to assist in the conservation of as much fodder for this Winter as possible from within our own resources and to supplement this with necessary imports as required. To this end I introduced a number of targeted measures including:<\/p>  <p>  - a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive engagement with this measure<\/p>  <p>  - a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. The measure operates through the Co-operatives\/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12th August 2018 to 31st December 2018. <\/p>  <p>  In July I secured agreement from EU Commissioner Hogan to pay higher advance Pillar 1 and 2 payments, increased to 70% and 85% respectively. In excess of &euro;1.5 billion has been paid to farmers to date under Pillar 1 and 2 since mid September. <\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, my Department made some temporary adjustments to the GLAS scheme for this year which have the potential to add to the quantities of winter fodder available by bringing over 260,000 additional hectares into production. In addition, in consultation with my ministerial colleague Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., a two week extension of the closed period for the spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers was implemented that allowed farmers capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent national fodder survey conducted on my behalf by Teagasc last October indicated that the national fodder shortfall has been reduced to 1% nationally.  It is clear that the various support interventions I have introduced have worked and continue to help alleviate what was a very serious fodder conservation issue on many farms during the dry summer period.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that while the deficit nationally has been reduced significantly there still remains a  fodder deficit on some farms and there is a need for farmers to remain vigilant and avoid complacency. I have urged Teagasc and the other Stakeholders to continue their individual efforts in support of those farmers worst affected and in need of help. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst it is not possible to predict the duration or severity of the coming winter and its resultant impact on the farming community,  I can assure the Deputy that I together my officials will continue to closely monitor the fodder situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Information and Communications Technology","counter":982,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT05000"},{"type":"question","counter":983,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[53601\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans for initiatives for rural farmers to have access to better technology and broadband.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":984,"content":"<p>The provision of rural broadband is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>  <p>  However, my Department makes extensive use of ICT systems and technology to provide the best possible services to its customers and to allow farmers interact with it in the easiest way possible.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department and its Information Management and Technology (IMT) Division has a very good reputation in the delivery of schemes with ICT systems.  For instance, since 2015 my Department has delivered almost all of its CAP reform schemes online with end to end automated processing.  This has allowed Ireland to be among the first in Europe to launch schemes and to make payments to farmers at the earliest possible opportunity.  Since 2015 Ireland has been the second fastest country to draw down and disperse funds to the rural community from the CAP schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In line with my Department's Statement of Strategy 2016-2019 and IMT Statement of Strategy 2017-2020 my Department is constantly seeking to make the best use of new and emerging technologies.  My Department previously launched a mobile phone app that allowed farmers to get up to date details of the prices being paid by different Meat Processors for the different classifications of carcases.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department is at an advanced stage of development to provide a calf birth registration application that will be accessible on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. This will allow farmers to register calf birth details directly with the Department&rsquo;s Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) system in remote locations such as farm sheds using the their smart mobile phone.  This app will help to minimise errors in calf birth details submitted and avoid duplication of records on the farm.  An enhancement to allow farmers process farm to farm movements for cattle will be included in a subsequent phase which will be available later in 2019.   Further enhancements will be released on an on-going basis.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its on-going commitment to providing an efficient and effective customer service to its clients, my Department is seeking to develop a new customer engagement contact system. This new contact centre will build on the current telephony system with the creation of a new single point of contact for each customer. The contact centre will be further enhanced by the provision of a single view of each customer, thereby facilitating a more enhanced and holistic approach to customer interactions. <\/p>  <p>  Under EU regulations, 2018 was the first year that all applications for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) had to be submitted online. I was aware that for some people, this was the first year that they engaged with the online applications process and they may have found this process daunting.  To help farmers to submit their applications online in 2018, I ensured that the BPS application facility was open over a month earlier than in 2017.  This provided more time for farmers to familiarise themselves with the online application facility and to submit their applications. My Department contacted these farmers at an early date advising them of the requirement to submit online in 2018. A number of additional supports as follows were also put in place:<\/p>  <p>  - How-to booklets<\/p>  <p>  - How-to videos<\/p>  <p>  - Lo-call telephone support<\/p>  <p>  - Targeted letters, texts and phone calls<\/p>  <p>  - 1-to-1 Clinics <\/p>  <p>  These supports ensured that all farmers were able to access these important payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":985,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT05300"},{"type":"question","counter":986,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[53616\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900080#WRT05400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 173 of 20 September 2018 and 248 of 14 November 2018, when the farmer will receive the outstanding payment in view of the fact that the error was made well over a year ago; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":987,"content":"<p>The person named was approved into GLAS 1 with a contract commencement date of 1 October 2015 and has received payments for scheme years 2015, 2016, 2017 and the 2018 Advance.<\/p><p>An issue arose with this case that resulted in a penalty being deducted in error.

However, it should be noted that any afforestation within a Natura site must satisfy Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, and must also be agreed to by National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service. Until the Threat Response Plan is completed, my Department will not be in a position to approve afforestation projects within the SPAs. <\/p>  <p>  The European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, stipulates that any Minister considering a plan or project in a Special Protection Area (SPA) shall give consent for such a plan or project only after having determined that the plan or project shall not adversely affect the integrity of a European site. A series of judgements issued by the Court of Justice of the EU have stressed that there must be no doubt about possible adverse impacts in such decisions. In addition, under the European Union guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas, within Natura sites (i.e. SPAs and Special Areas of Conservation, or SACs), only afforestation consistent with the management objectives of the sites concerned, and agreed with the Member State&rsquo;s authority in charge of implementing Natura 2000 (in Ireland&rsquo;s case, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht), shall be allowed.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise the importance of the preservation and conservation of the Hen Harrier and other protected bird species.

The focus has been on the staffing, infrastructural and information technology requirements that will arise in the context of the implementation of import controls at ports and airports on an East-West basis under the Central Case Scenario. <\/p>  <p>  These requirements are significant, and will arise in respect of the import of live animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin from the UK into Ireland and the EU once the UK has become a third country, the conditions for which are set out in EU legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 included an allocation of &euro;3.75 million for the first phase in a process of recruitment of the necessary staff that will run until 2021. This will facilitate the recruitment of up to 116 staff across a range of work streams in 2019. This allocation forms part of a larger allocation of &euro;7 million in 2019 which will also address IT hardware and software requirements.  The Department is also continuing to engage with the Office of Public Works and with other Departments and agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, on the additional physical infrastructure that will be required at ports and airports.<\/p>  <p>  More recently, the Department has been sharpening its focus on the potential response that may be necessary in the event of a disorderly Brexit at the end of March 2019.  The focus in this regard is on the arrangements that will be necessary in order to fulfil our legal obligations as efficiently as possible while also ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trading arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  As has been the case with planning for the central case scenario, the Department is focussing on staffing, infrastructural and IT aspects. It is also continuing its close co-operation with other Government departments and agencies, and is engaging in particular with the OPW in relation to the temporary physical infrastructure that may be required at port and airport locations in the event of a hard Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900081#WRU03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1030,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[53639\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900081#WRU03800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if Rosslare Harbour has border inspection post status; his views on an application to the European Commission regarding same; and if consideration is being given to using funds in his Department to upgrade infrastructure at Rosslare Harbour to prepare for the possibility of the UK becoming a third country to the EU in 2019.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1031,"content":"<p>As part of on-going planning for Brexit, my Department has been working with other government departments, including the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in assessing the infrastructure requirements at ports that are currently in receipt of consignments of products, plants and animals from the UK.

Salmon stocks are, therefore, managed on an individual river basis with each river having a Conservation Limit (CL) which is scientifically assessed on an annual basis by the independent Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon.<\/p>  <p>  River stocks can be harvested only where a sufficient surplus over the CL has been identified. where commercial fisheries exist, such surpluses are shared between stakeholders (anglers and commercial fishermen) via the representative District Fishery Committee.  Commercial fishing in estuaries is only permitted where all rivers contributing to the estuary are exceeding their individual CL so as to avoid indiscriminate exploitation.   <\/p>  <p>  Commercial fishing for salmon is by way of public licence. Licences are applied for and issued annually.  An annual public licence does not confer property or other rights on the holder and consequently licences are not transferable.  In that regard also, the issue of compensation does not arise. The Commercial fishing season generally opens in May of each year and notice of statutory provisions governing the application for, and issue of, licences and other conditions for 2019 will be notified in the first quarter of next year.<\/p>  <p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced following the decision to cease, for conservation reasons, the commercial salmon mixed stock fishery in the sea. In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects. Under the scheme, fishermen active in the fishery could opt to voluntarily cease fishing in the commercial drift net and draft net sectors and undertake not to seek a licence in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the average payment under the scheme was almost &euro;23,000.  The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008 and I understand that all funds were expended and there are currently no plans to revisit such a scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The international dimension to the protection and conservation of Atlantic salmon is important. In that context, the Atlantic salmon resource is managed through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with which Ireland is aligned through the European Union.   <\/p>  <p>  Concerted international co-operation has ensured that restrictions in Greenland and Faroese waters, to where salmon from Irish rivers migrate to feed before returning in adulthood to their natal river, have been in place for a number of years.  In June this year, my officials and those of IFI joined delegates from the EU, USA, Canada, Norway, the Russian Federation, Greenland and the Faroes in securing a continuation of restrictions in these waters to offer a level of protection to Irish and other stocks.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland chaired the discussions on Faroese waters to where the majority of migrating fish originate in European, including Irish waters. Agreement was secured that there will be no commercial fishing in these waters.  The challenge of asserting and securing the conservation and protection imperatives for salmon stocks when they are migrating in international waters would be significantly harder if we were not managing towards those imperatives at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900082#WRV04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hydraulic Fracturing Policy","counter":1089,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900082#WRV04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1090,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[53511\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900082#WRV04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his policy on the importation of fracked shale gas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1091,"content":"<p>The National Mitigation Plan, published in July 2017, restates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to move from a fossil fuel-based electricity system to a low-carbon power system.

I take part in all cabinet discussions on homelessness and actively contribute across all policy responsibilities with my lens as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. <\/p>  <p>  I have had 8 bi-lateral discussions with the Ministers with responsibility for Housing, Planning and Local Government since my appointment as Minister to discuss child and family homelessness and the overall housing policy relating to legislative proposals and policy developments in this area. In addition, my advisers and the Department officials have engaged regularly with their counterparts from the Department of Housing on these matters. These interactions continue on an on-going basis. <\/p>  <p>  My focus in this area has been twofold; firstly, to ensure that all the additional supports children living in temporary accommodation need are in place, and secondly, to work with my Government colleagues to progress measures that prevent families becoming homeless. <\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to have led the establishment of the free childcare scheme for children living in emergency accommodation. It is a key priority for me to ensure that all children are accessing high-quality early childhood education and care during this formative time in their lives in order to avoid any long-term disadvantage on learning and education.  <\/p>  <p>  Children in emergency accommodation are also prioritised in the school completion programme.  This provides them with access to homework clubs, breakfast clubs, out of school activities such as sport, music and art, learning supports and therapeutic interventions. <\/p>  <p>  To combat educational disadvantage further, families in homelessness with school age children have free public transport to school.  <\/p>  <p>  Beyond my own Ministerial brief, I have contributed to Government policy on prevention of homelessness that is recognised as a key response to the on-going crisis. <\/p>  <p>  I have progressed a number of initiatives through my engagements with Minister Murphy which will help families to stay in their current homes in the private rented sector, including greater clarity as to what constitutes a Substantial Renovation, and further, the establishment of the forthcoming deposit protections scheme and providing greater powers to Residential Tenancies Board. Legislation on this effect is currently being drafted. <\/p>  <p>  I have also pursued other measures, in areas such as better regulation of the private rented sector, bringing vacant properties into social housing use and providing better protections to families in risk of homelessness through earlier access to Homeless HAP supports.  All of this work involves in-depth policy scrutiny and my advisers are engaging with advisers and officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am committed to ensuring that we are building more social and affordable housing going forward.  This is the key element to reducing homelessness in the medium to long term. I have welcomed the establishment of the Land Development Agency which will ensure a more strategic State leadership in development of land going forward, which will contribute to a more stable and socially sustainable housing sector in Ireland.

I have considered that feedback in the context of a wider focus on the development of the rural recreation sector and I will make a final decision regarding the future mandate of Comhairle na Tuaithe shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for the development of rural and outdoor recreation is shared across a number of Government Departments.  However, my Department supports rural recreation primarily through the Walks Scheme and the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreation infrastructure and\/or the maintenance, enhancement or promotion of existing outdoor recreation infrastructure in Ireland.  Over 500 projects around the country have been approved for funding of over &euro;20 million under this scheme since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to double the funding available for the Walks Scheme and to increase the number of trails covered.  Budget 2019 provided an increase in funding for the Walks Scheme, from &euro;2 million per annum, to &euro;4 million per annum from next year.  <\/p>  <p>  I will shortly be initiating a review of the operation of Walks Scheme which will inform decisions regarding the expansion of the scheme.  In order to be in a position to bring new trails on to the scheme as soon as possible, I will also be inviting Local Development Companies and Local Authorities to submit expressions of interest in respect of trails that meet specific qualifying criteria, to be considered for inclusion in the scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900085#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme Data","counter":1250,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900085#WRY02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1251,"qnumday":524,"qnumall":"[53938\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900085#WRY02900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the amount of expenditure that has been incurred to date under the local improvement scheme allocation of almost &euro;10 million to local authorities announced on 26 October 2018 to local authorities sanctioned by each local authority on the scheme in tabular form.","asker":"1335","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":1252,"content":"<p>The Local Improvement Scheme, or LIS, is a programme for improvement works on small private or non-public roads in rural areas.

This can slow down the processing of their claim and may result in the need for a visit by an inspector of the Department and perhaps multiple requests for further information before a final decision can be taken on the application.<\/p>  <p>  The SPNC scheme area has a performance target of 75% of new claims to be awarded within 12 weeks of receipt.

The 2017 at-risk-of-poverty rate for children was 18.4%, a slight reduction on the 2016 figure of 19.1% while the deprivation rate was 23.0%, down from 25.0% in 2016.  It should be noted that the SILC data from 2012 through to 2016 was revised by the CSO, resulting in some changes to previously published data.

In 2011, the consistent poverty rate for children was 9.3%, equating to roughly 107,000 children.  By 2014, this had risen significantly to 12% (roughly 143,000 children).  The 2017 consistent poverty rate for children was 8.8%, equating to some 105,000 children.

Although the system change has worked effectively for over 80% of IB customers, significant difficulties arose following implementation for a number of customers. <\/p>  <p>  My Department took three main steps to resolve the issues impacting on payments.  First, it deployed additional staff to process works and respond to the customer enquiries.  Second, it developed some new IT \"workarounds\" that address the payment gap issues and to ensure a faster flow-through to payments.  Third, it continued to review the design rules in the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates.<\/p>  <p>  I believe we have made good progress in this regard, with payment levels returned to and maintained at the expected norm, (over 50,000 customers paid each week) for the past two months.  Arrears payments have also been made to customers who were delayed payments.  Telephone helpline and call handling performance has also been addressed and is now back to normal levels. Currently, people who are due a payment and whose certificates and claims are in order now receive their payment entitlement promptly.  In stating this it is important to note that there are always cases, and were always such cases under the old system, where people's payments are legitimately stopped or paused for a variety of reasons. In addition there will always be cases where errors are made that impact payments to individual customers. While we endeavour to keep these to a minimum it is inevitable that some errors will be made in an Illness Benefit scheme that processes over 9,000 transactions per day.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that we learn from the lessons of the transition of the IB system onto a new platform, I have arranged for an independent review into how the changes to IB were planned, implemented and &ndash; importantly &ndash; communicated to customers.  I expect this work to be completed early in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to sincerely apologise again for the difficulties and burden experienced by customers earlier this year and believe the action taken to address these issues  has worked and is continuing to work  to ensure customers receive  a good standard of service.  <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900086#WRZ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":1339,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900086#WRZ05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1340,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[53836\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900086#WRZ06000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps she can take to ensure the minimum waiting time for dealing with appeals having particular regard to the hardship caused to those awaiting decisions over long periods resulting in some cases homelessness and desperation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1341,"content":"<p>The average appeal processing times for all appeals determined to the end of November 2018 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the table below.  <\/p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  <\/p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers and Designated Persons are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.

Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017. The corresponding processing times for the period January to November 2018 are 30.1 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.

The programme assists participants to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills, which can then be used in the workplace.  Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed-term.  There are participation time limits in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome increase in the number of people at work and the continued reduction in Live Register numbers is a factor in recruitment to all work programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it should be noted that I have implemented a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability to a greater number of people on the Live Register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on a programme. <\/p>  <p>  The general qualifying age for CE for those on the Live Register was reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It is now easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to re-qualify as participation prior to the year 2007 is disregarded.  There is an overall limit of 6 years participation from 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment).  While participants between 21 and 55 years on CE are entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over can avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017. The corresponding processing times for the period January to November 2018 are 30.1 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.

The &lsquo;Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023', which I launched in February 2018, details specific time-lined actions Government will take to reform our pension system.  This includes the introduction, from 2022, of an &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment&rsquo; retirement savings system, for those without personal retirement savings.  This project timeframe reflects the scale of such a programme and its importance as being the most fundamental reform of the Irish supplementary pension system in generations.<\/p>  <p>  A new &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Management Office&rsquo; within my Department has started the work required to establish the evidence base which will inform future Government decisions regarding the design of the system.  An Interdepartmental Programme Board has also been established to provide strategic direction to automatic enrolment. <\/p>  <p>  In August, I launched a national consultation process and a &lsquo;Strawman Proposal for Automatic Enrolment&rsquo;.  This is intended to help the Government in considering the operational structure and design decisions that it will need to be make.

In addition it is building further evidence through ongoing consultations, and it is sponsoring impact assessments.  These need to be completed and conclusions drawn before Government can make definitive decisions regarding the operational and design characteristics for automatic enrolment so that the first members would be enrolled in the new system in 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900087#WRAA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":1382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900087#WRAA04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1383,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[53920\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900087#WRAA04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made to base the pension review for those impacted by the 2012 changes on a 40 year contribution record in order to gain a full State pension (contributory); if this decision has been made for the TCA model; if so, the reason 40 years has been chosen; if consultations on this decision took place with trade unions and key stakeholders; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1384,"content":"<p>A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of this, on 23 January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated using an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring periods.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the current yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).   No-one will lose as a result of this option, and people will be paid whichever model produces the higher payment.<\/p>  <p>  It was announced at that time, in January 2018, that the number of years required under this approach (\"TCA2012\") would be 40, and this was set out in the legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas this month.  While it will not become law until enactment, is has been clearly planned that it be based on 40 years since it was announced, and that position has not changed.<\/p>  <p>  40 years was chosen based upon it being a reasonable figure, commonly used in other pension schemes and systems, and with an allowance of up to 20 years of HomeCaring periods, it means a maximum pension can be earned with just 20 years of paid contributions, which would be generous by international standards.  The balance between years required and homecaring periods allowed for was decided by Government in the context of representations that had been made by various stakeholders, the Exchequer funds available, the sustainability of the pension system, and the principles of fairness and gender equality.  An alternative balance - for example, 30 years required, but only 10 years of homecaring periods, all post-1994, as originally proposed in the National Pensions Framework - would have been more advantageous for some pensioners, but would have been of limited benefit for women who were most affected by the 2012 rateband changes.<\/p>  <p>  I launched a public consultation on the design of the full TCA to be introduced from 2020 on the 28th of May to which stakeholder groups were invited including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were also invited to a briefing in Leinster House.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and we received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents upon a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process. <\/p>  <p>  There has been no decision on the number of years required to qualify for a maximum rate pension under the Total Contributions Approach that will apply from 2020.  Analysis of the views submitted is being finalised, and I understand will be submitted to me in the coming months.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal to Government in due course.  The scheme will be introduced through the standard democratic process, and the balance of the proposal will, I believe, be broadly debated by members of the Oireachtas.    <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900087#WRAA04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":1385,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900087#WRAA04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1386,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[53978\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900087#WRAA04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an application for disability allowance by a person (details supplied) will be processed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1387,"content":"<p>I confirm that my department received an application for disability allowance from this lady on 8 November 2018.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard. <b><\/b><\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware that, under the relevant legislation, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.<b><\/b><\/p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.<b><\/b><\/p><p>A valuation for commercial rates purposes is arrived at by estimating the <i>Net Annual Value<\/i>(NAV) of the property in question, at a specified valuation date. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 as &ldquo;the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant&rdquo;. This definition of Net Annual Value is applied to all rateable properties and on a nationwide basis. <\/p><p>Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based exercise. During a revaluation, the Valuation Office analyses relevant market rental transactions for all rateable properties, including service stations, in accordance with the legislation, best practice internationally as set out in published Practice Guidance Notes, well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts. The conclusion drawn from that analysis is applied to similarly circumstanced property using the &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; method of valuation which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties.<b><\/b><\/p><p>There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law. Appeals are made on an individual case basis. However, the decision in one case can have relevance in other similar cases.<\/p><p>There is no provision in the legislation for taking a &ldquo;class&rdquo; or group appeal before the Tribunal, as each case is considered on its individual merits and by reference to the specific circumstances of the property. However, individual appellants can make arguments to the Valuation Tribunal in relation to their concerns about the overall valuation methodology adopted by the Valuation Office for a specific category of rateable property.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am informed that it is possible for a Test case to be heard by the Valuation Tribunal. In order to proceed with a Test case all parties involved must agree that such an approach is appropriate.  In addition, such a process must be entered into on the clear understanding that the determination of the Valuation Tribunal in the test case would set a precedent which would without exception apply to the remaining cases identified as being part of the test case series and only these cases.  All cases involved would have to be similarly circumstanced.  A test case would be identified and nominated through mutual agreement.  This particular case would then be heard by the Valuation Tribunal.  <\/p><p>The need for attention to detail and confirmation of such cannot be underestimated in the use of a test case.  The determination of the Valuation Tribunal would be applied to the nominated test case and all other cases identified as being part of the test case series and only these cases.  The Valuation Tribunal would be advised in advance that the case being heard was a test case and would be relevant for these other cases. The right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law for either the appellant or respondent still applies in a test case situation.  <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900087#WRAA06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Expenditure","counter":1405,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900088#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1406,"qnumday":575,"qnumall":"[53579\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900088#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount spent by his Department on public advertising and the purchase of external communications and publicity in 2018 by advertising campaign including specific amounts on social media campaigns (details supplied) or other digital platforms; the amount spent on public relations or other communications support in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1407,"qnumday":585,"qnumall":"[53993\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900088#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount spent on social media by his Department in 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018; the projected spend in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1408,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[54010\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121900088#WRBB00500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount spent on marketing and media by his Department in 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018; the projected spend in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1409,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 575, 585 and 586 together.<\/p><p>Press and public relations functions are generally undertaken by the officials in my Department's Press Office.

In 2017 expenditure of &euro;64,167 was incurred in respect of social media relating to the  Creative Ireland programme.  This arose from a comprehensive citizen engagement programme to showcase the range and depth of Ireland's cultural and creative offering and to encourage participation in arts and creative activities as a means of individual, collective and societal well-being.  The vision of the Creative Ireland Programme is that every person in Ireland should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential.  This represents a new approach to creativity and cultural policy and therefore required a sustained communications programme in 2017.  A combination of approaches and platforms were used to maximise impact, taking account of the diversity of the target audiences.

Three bespoke videos were produced to support and raise awareness of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g - Ireland's new national day of Creativity for children and young people - at a cost of &euro;24,815.<\/p><p>In addition to promoting interest in specific initiatives such as Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, social media is also actively used to support and promote the Creative Ireland Programme generally as well as specific creative endeavours and partner activities.  During 2018, specific short videos were also commissioned to promote various aspects or pillars of the Creative Ireland Programme. These included a specially commissioned spoken word piece by Stephen James Smith to mark the publication of 31 Local Authority Culture and Creativity Strategies in September accompanied by five short videos to illustrate the breadth and range of activities supported by the local authority Creative Ireland Programmes; and a video to mark the roll out of the Creative Schools initiative in 150 schools nationwide, in partnership with the Arts Council and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>All these videos are available at .<\/p><p>A full breakdown of all costs in 2018 in relation to these activities will be published on the Creative Ireland website  The following table summarises the above mentioned expenditures.<table><tr><th>Creative Ireland Expenditure Summary<\/th><th>2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Regional radio &amp;amp; social media campaign <\/td><td>&euro;48,780 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g videos <\/td><td>&euro;24,815 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Creative Ireland Programme  <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Media content - uploading of articles daily throughout 2018 <\/td><td>&euro;66,420 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12 videos <\/td><td>&euro;93,110 <\/td><\/tr><\/table>A similar level of  expenditure  is expected in 2019.<\/p><p>I am also advised that the Culture Ireland Unit has this year engaged Mr. Nik Quaife on a 1 year contract for the provision of services including a communications strategy for its GB18 programme, to celebrate and renew Ireland&rsquo;s cultural relationship with Britain.
