","asker":"1478","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to a new national afforestation programme which will benefit farmers, the sector, the environment and society at large. This is clearly set out in the Programme for Government which is ambitious for the future of Irish forestry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While it's well known that forestry has had its share of its difficulties in recent times, which we are addressing, there is enormous potential for a new model of forestry to deliver multi-functional benefits for society.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of delays in finalising the new CAP and\u00a0new State Aid rules, the current Forestry Programme which operates under the same Sate Aid rules as CAP\u00a0will now likely extend\u00a0to end 2021. A new Forestry Programme will be required for the next period\u00a0and we will have the opportunity to look afresh at what we want from forestry as landowners, communities, businesses and state enterprises.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I believe that any new Programme must align fully with other agricultural schemes, particularly\u00a0to encourage uptake by farmers.\u00a0Combining woodland creation with farming is the future if we are to meet our afforestation targets. \u00a0If farm forestry is to succeed in the decades ahead it must deliver an economic return for the farmer in a way that complements and enhances the farming enterprise. <\/p>  <p>  Future woodland creation on farms must strike a more even balance between ecosystem service delivery and timber production. In terms of eco-system delivery there are lots of\u00a0options to consider. Agroforestry for example will allow farming to continue on land also planted with trees.\u00a0 Fast growing trees for renewable energy can be used to fuel on-farm biomass boilers; shelterbelts can \u00a0enhance animal welfare while also increasing grass growth, planting tree species rich in nectar and pollen will support pollinators.<\/p>  <p>  We already have an ambitious \u00a0target to increase forest\u00a0 cover to 8,000 hectares per year under the Climate Action Plan and this Governemt\u00a0is committed to\u00a0enacting a new Climate\u00a0Bill soon.\u00a0It's obvious\u00a0that any future woodland creation\u00a0 towards that target must have a much greater focus on delivering environmental benefits, to include for example enhancing water quality, habitat creation and climate adaption measures. To deliver on these aims there will have to be\u00a0greater emphasis on species diversity particularly native species. Sustainable forest management is also \u00a0key. \u00a0We will need to \u00a0incentivise continuous cover forestry on suitable sites, moving away from clearfell and replanting where possible and have more strategic planting to alleviate the risk of flooding and to create filtration buffers along watercourses to protect aquatic habitats.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  We will be announcing a public consultation process\u00a0for the new\u00a0Forestry Programme shortly, which will\u00a0also encompass a new Forestry Strategy. It\u00a0is intended that a wide range of stakeholders\u00a0will take part \u00a0and I anticipate \u00a0that\u00a0it \u00a0will\u00a0deliver a multitude of \u00a0ideas\u00a0to help form a sustainable forestry model for Ireland.\u00a0 We\u00a0look forward to active and constructive engagement\u00a0from all interested parties\u00a0across society to help\u00a0shape this new vision.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300079#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":19,"content":"<p>Question No. 32 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300079#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[33175\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300079#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to ensure the sustainability of the fishery within the 6 nm limit following the recent decision of the High Court to overturn the ban on vessels of over 18 metres fishing in that area; and the way in which he can ensure fairness to all fishers whether inshore or those historically reliant on fishing within the 6 nm limit.","asker":"1463","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>In December 2018, following a public consultation process in which over 900 submissions were received, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine announced that vessels over 18m will be excluded from trawling in inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020.\u00a0\u00a0A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable\u00a0adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone.<\/p><p>A Policy Directive was issued by the\u00a0Minister to the independent Licensing Authority for Sea Fishing Boats under Statute and was intended to give effect to the measures announced by the then Minister.

Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006\/130\/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.<\/p>  <p>  There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019\/6.\u00a0However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.\u00a0 Scientific evidence is now available showing that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019\/6.

Moorepark is globally renowned for its research and development of sustainable grassbased systems of milk production, and associated dairy processing research. As well as research, Moorepark also plays a very important role in education and extension. In education, it has developed 2 very innovative courses with UCD comprising a Dairy Business degree\u00a0 and a Diploma in Dairy Farm Management, where students spend a significant amount of time in Moorepark.<\/p>  <p>  On site Moorepark employs some 400 people including graduate students. On average Teagasc spend over &euro;20m annually on research at the Moorepark Campus. My Department is a significant funder contributing funding through yearly Grant in Aid allocations to Teagasc and through the Research Stimulus and FIRM funding programmes, which are both very important to Teagasc, Moorepark. There are currently 52 Active projects across all the programmes that involve Moorepark and a total award amount exceeds &euro;15m.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In terms of Grant in Aid, my Department has provided Teagasc with an increased allocation next year of some &euro;7m bringing the overall allocation for the year to almost &euro;147m. It includes a &euro;42m allocation to support current expenditure across the education, advisory and research directorates. Prioritisation of funding for particular services\/programmes is an operational matter for Teagasc to determine.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to Moorepark, Food Wise 2025 called for increased investment in Research, Development and Innovation, noting that low levels by the agri-food sector were inhibiting the transition towards higher value production and exports.\u00a0Part of the response included a recommendation that Teagasc develop a &ldquo;Food Innovation Hub&rdquo; at its Moorepark campus to promote greater collaboration between industry and public research and deliver a step change in innovation activity in the food industry. My Department agreed to provide almost &euro;9m for the project from its capital allocation on a phased basis. Just over &euro;5m has been paid\u00a0to date to meet the costs of the project with an additional &euro;2.5m allocated for the remainder of this year. On completion in early 2021, the 'Hub' will consist of 12 custom designed Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) units, equipped with dedicated offices, laboratories and temperature controlled storage space.<\/p>  <p>  It will create an environment where new concepts can be generated, new products manufactured, and test marketed for commercial potential. Greater industry investment in Research, Development and Innovation will be encouraged to develop new products and exploit growing market segments internationally particularly in the dairy sector. It will support innovation in the food industry thus enabling companies to become more competitive while also generating market focused research initiatives.\u00a0SMEs will be provided with opportunities to engage in research activities in an affordable way, allowing smaller companies to scale up and engage in an expanded range of Research, Development and Innovation with renowned Teagasc food researchers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Food Hub, Teagasc has also carried out a &euro;10m upgrade of the Moorepark Technology Ltd pilot plant facility at the Moorepark campus.\u00a0This meant refurbishment of existing infrastructure and building new processing capability.\u00a0The newly upgraded facility offers a variety of services ranging from pilot plant rental and technical assistance through contract R&amp;D and pre-commercial manufacture. It allows dairy companies to fine tune new processes and products at a pilot scale before embarking on full-scale industrial production.

I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of Covid, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  <\/p><p>On 19<sup>th<\/sup>October, the Taoiseach announced that the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with COVID-19 for a period of 6 weeks, starting midnight on Wednesday, the 21<sup>st<\/sup>. <\/p><p>The Taoiseach has called on us all to work together to suppress the virus, and to reopen as much of our society and economy as possible when it is safe to do so.

Agri-food businesses, including marts, are eligible for the wide range of supports put in place for businesses generally. A comprehensive list of these supports is available on the Gov.ie website.<\/p><p>Marts have been using online mart sales systems since April.  From a position where few marts had online systems in place, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently, the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are operating through these platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing online systems.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise.<\/p><p>This is undoubtedly a challenging time.  My Department is closely monitoring the situation, and we are seeing some positive aspects of online sales at marts.<\/p><p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.  The number of people logging in to online sales on a daily basis are many multiples of the numbers of people that typically physically attend mart sales. The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices. <\/p><p>Since the introduction of Level 5, during the first five days on which marts were in operation using online sales, the cattle throughput in marts came to 36,034  head &ndash; this compares to 42,918 head in the corresponding five day same period in 2019. This means that, despite the undoubted disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 84% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts and service providers involved.<\/p><p>These figures are testament to the hard work and commitment of marts to keep operating in this difficult period.

It has been widely used as a core part of the TB eradication programme in Ireland since 2015 following many years of it being researched and tested in specific problem herds. Like all such tools, it is important to use it in ways which maximise its utility. Each diagnostic test has strengths and weaknesses, and the way in which a test is used must take these into account. The key measures of a diagnostic test&rsquo;s accuracy are sensitivity and specificity.  As is the case with diagnostic tests for other diseases, none of the tests currently available for the diagnosis of bovine TB (bTB) allow a perfectly accurate determination of the M. bovis infection status of cattle. <\/p>  <p>  The single intradermal comparative tuberculin skin test (SICCT), often referred to as the skin test, which is used in Ireland is universally regarded as the best screening test in a general population of animals. However, in a group of animals where TB infection is known to be present, the gamma interferon test is used because it can detect infected cattle at an earlier stage post-infection than the skin test. Therefore it can detect a higher proportion of infected cattle; in other words, it has higher sensitivity than the skin test. When used in parallel to the skin test, the gamma interferon blood test can help to resolve TB problems in a herd more quickly by identifying cattle at an early stage of infection before they can spread infection onwards.    <\/p>  <p>  The gamma interferon test is used as standard in herds which have experienced a significant TB breakdown (for example, five or more reactors, 5% of the herd, or where the investigating veterinary inspector deems it necessary on epidemiological grounds). In addition, the gamma interferon test is used as a quality control measure on SICTT reactors, providing additional confidence in the quality of the skin testing process. <\/p>  <p>  However, the gamma interferon test is not suitable for use as a general screening test, in the way the SICCT test is used, because it has lower specificity than the skin test. That means the proportion of truly non-infected cattle identified as negative is lower with the gamma interferon test than with the skin test. Using it in herds not thought to be TB-infected would lead to non-infected cattle testing false positive. <\/p>  <p>  One of the recommendations made by the TB Forum was for additional focussing on herds with chronic or recurrent TB problems. Based on this recommendation my officials are developing policies which will involve additional uses of the gamma interferon test; these will be discussed in more detail at the TB Forum as part of the ongoing discussions on TB strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are two laboratories in Ireland carrying out gamma interferon TB testing for my Department; a tender for a third lab to provide additional testing capacity has recently closed and this is expected to support an increase in test capacity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300081#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300081#WRD01050"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[33562\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300081#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the details of his Department's response following the collapse of the online bidding system for livestock marts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>Since the beginning of the Covid19 crisis, my Department has worked intensively, in cooperation with marts representative organisations, to ensure that marts may remain in operation. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.

The factors contributing to this quality include Irish genetic breeding standards, sheep welfare standards and the availability of quality Irish grass, water and nutritional supplementation on Irish Sheep farms. Irish sheep have a high animal health status being free from sheep exotic diseases including sheep pox that when present downgrades wool quality. In addition, Irish sheep farms adheres to high biosecurity and quality assurance standards.

The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase critical care and general acute bed capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet demand. <\/p>  <p>  Significant work has been underway in 2020 to increase capacity as far as is possible. The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) agreed to support the marginal costs of funding additional general acute beds until the 31st December 2020 at an estimated cost of &euro;24 million for the year. The HSE confirmed 197 of those beds have opened as planned. In addition, the HSE advised on 22 June 2020 that an additional 324 acute beds have opened since March, bringing the current total of acute beds in the system to 11,597 excluding critical care capacity.<\/p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020\/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. As such, 251 additional acute beds and 89 sub-acute beds are due to open in quarter 4 of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to critical care, at the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300083#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[33307\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300083#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of the allocated funding for the pathology programme in University Hospital Kerry.","asker":"1488","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300083#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Accommodation","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300083#WRF02050"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[33463\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300083#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a report on projects to upgrade nursing and residential homes in County Cork to HIQA standards will be provided;

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. <\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of months my Department and the HSE have collaborated to increase capacity and readiness across the health service in response to the pandemic. This encompasses developments across all areas of the health service, including with regard to public health teams, contact tracing and acute hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE now has standing capacity to test 120,000 people every week. As part of its ongoing process improvement, the HSE is currently running a nationwide recruitment campaign for swabbers and contact tracers, setting up temporary swabbing sites and making process improvements to the end-to-end test and trace system. Recruitment is a key focus. 500 additional contact tracers are being hired to provide standing capacity for contact tracing with 280 already in place and a further 60 - 70 being appointed on a weekly basis. A further 180 people have been appointed to date to carry out swabbing activities, whilst additional candidates are currently going through the compliance and interview process.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to identify the products and funding level required to meet the clinical demand for PPE for the remainder of 2020 and 2021. My Department and the HSE are continuing to engage on future requirements to ensure adequate stocks of all required materials are sourced and maintained in line with forecast demand.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also currently involved in an EU Procurement Exercise being operated by the European Commission on behalf of member states to procure suitable, safe and effective vaccines, in sufficient quantities, to combat Covid-19. Both my Department and the HSE have actively engaged in meetings of the Steering Board that is chaired by the Commission which provides the core governance and consultative forum for the EU procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  The arrangements are intended to ensure a coordinated action at the European level to vaccinate the EU population. Ireland has already opted into two Advance Purchase Agreements (APA), (1) with the British-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca, which is partnering with Oxford University and (2) with Janssen, a Belgian Pharmaceutical company owned by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a COVID-19 Immunisation Strategy Group has also been established. The purpose of the Group is to advise on and assist in the development of national policy relating to COVID-19 vaccines. <\/p>  <p>  At the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. <\/p>  <p>   Where necessary, the number of critical care beds can surge beyond the baseline of 280-285 as part of an emergency response. However, it is essential to understand that the use of surge capacity for critical care is necessarily tied to a reduction of services in other areas of the hospital. Moreover, the clinical advice is clear that the greater the reliance on surge ICU capacity, the greater the clinical risk with potential impact on patient outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  Our critical care units have coped well so far, largely due to the fact that the curve was flattened successfully in early stages. As a result, our outcomes for Covid patients in ICU have compared well with other jurisdictions including the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer most scheduled care activity in March, April, and May of this year. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the WHO. <\/p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.<\/p>  <p>  In addition the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review 2018 found that the net requirement in combination with health system reform is for an additional 2,590 hospital beds by 2031 (2,100 inpatient, 300 day case and 190 critical care). The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.<\/p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. My Department is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. <\/p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020\/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. <\/p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that further details in relation to the delivery of health and social care services in the context of Covid-19 can be found in Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Assisted Human Reproduction","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH00850"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[33471\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of and position regarding the publicly funded model of care for fertility treatment as promised in the Programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, a commitment to introduce the model of care for infertility which was developed by officials in my Department in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme is included in the Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future<\/i>.  This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments).  Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.  It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.<\/p><p>Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.

The very significant additional funding will provide a further 5 million hours over this year&rsquo; target aimed at keeping older people healthy and happy, in their community, for as long as possible.  This represents about a 40% increase in home support hours over the 2018 NSP target. <\/p>  <p>  A high-quality, consistent home-support service, focused on keeping people well in their homes and communities for as long as possible, is a key enabler to ensuring that people across a continuum of care get the right care, in the right place, at the right time.  In this regard, my Department is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support.  Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the statutory scheme within the broader context of the on-going reform of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report (2017).   <\/p>  <p>  While work undertaken in 2019 focussed on the design of the scheme, work in 2020 is focussing on the development of a framework for the regulation of home-support services. In addition, the options for the funding of the new scheme are being examined through work with the Economic and Social Research Institute on the projected demand for, and cost of, home-support services in various scenarios. This work will ensure that the funding model developed for the statutory scheme is fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH03050"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[33173\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the protocol and processes in place when a Covid-19 contact tracer encounters resistance and a failure to cooperate from the close contact of a positive case.","asker":"1554","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH03250"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[30915\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300085#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the grant of tender award for development of a second cath laboratory at UHW before Christmas 2020 or sooner (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of a second Cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.

Five sectors were identified that account for 90% of the impact and these are: Agri-food, Pharma-chemicals, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Air Transport. <\/p>  <p>  The study also provided analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on employment. Significantly, in the model used in the study, the long run impact of Brexit on the labour market indicated that this would be employment neutral. This was based on the premise that changes in labour demand across sectors arising from Brexit would lead over the 10 year horizon of the study to redistribution of workers across sectors, with wages in each skills group adjusting in these sectors accordingly. <\/p>  <p>  This analysis, which was subsequently updated earlier this year, examined the trade implications arising from the adoption in 2019 of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Revised Political Declaration (RPD) between the EU and the UK.<\/p>  <p>  By its nature the 2018 study, and the latest iteration of that study, presents a broad trade analysis that concentrates on the long run economic context and potential employment impacts of different Brexit scenarios. It does not examine at a more granular level the economic impacts at sub-sector or regional level, or the employment impacts affecting different skill levels of the labour force.<\/p>  <p>  The type of analysis that the deputy refers to is more likely to be found in publications by the Central Bank. In its latest bulletin in early October, the Central Bank highlights the divergence between the continuing strength of the economy's exporting sector, dominated by pharmaceuticals, and the downturn due to Covid-19 restrictions brought upon the labour intensive domestic sector that has shed jobs.<\/p>  <p>  At national and regional level COVID-19 has obviously had a detrimental impact on levels of employment generally and, in particular on youth employment. This is further compounded with the onset of Brexit on 1 January next and I agree with the Deputy that this is a serious and ongoing concern. It is one that my colleague the Minister for Social Protection is engaged with and is actively looking at ways to mitigate the worst effects of the pandemic and Brexit on the employment opportunities for our young people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300089#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300090#WRN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[33716\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300090#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"his plans to roll out a nationwide campaign to promote purchases from Irish websites and stores offering click and collect over the next six weeks in view of the closure of retailers as a result of the latest Covid-19 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As such, it is statutory provision and I would have no discretion in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Registrar of Companies has taken a number of decisions, in light of the Covid-19 situation, to assist companies with the filing of annual returns. In March, the Registrar announced that all annual returns, where the deadline for filing fell between 18th March 2020 and 30th June 2020 (both dates inclusive), would be treated as received on time if all elements were submitted by 30th June 2020.

Companies that need to avail of this provision can file annual returns up to 26th February 2021.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. As of\u00a027 October, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 118,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork. <\/p><p>NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website (). <\/p><p>  In\u00a0Monaghan surveys have commenced in the areas of Cornacassa, Cortolvin, Ballybay, and Stranooden. Other areas which will be surveyed include Mullinahinch, Bellanode, Drumhilock, Tydavnet, Cloughnart, Scotstown and Killymarley.<\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 23 October, some 179 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. It is anticipated that 275 BCP sites will be connected by the end of the year. Further details can be found at .<\/p><p>  BCPs connected in County\u00a0Monaghan include\u00a0Saint Alphonsus Community Hall and Ballybay Wetlands, with other locations at Latton Resource Centre, Corduff Community Centre, Tannagh Outdoor Education Centre, Corcaghan Community Centre, Carn Resource Centre and\u00a0Mullyash Community Centre to be connected in the coming months.\u00a0 A number of schools in Co Monaghan including Drumcorrin and Drumgossatt National Schools will be connected to high speed broadband as part of the BCP initiative.\u00a0My Department will work with Department of Education and Skills\u00a0to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP.<\/p><p>  I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. Eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. <\/p><p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic.

","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>The EU aims to be climate-neutral by 2050. This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU&rsquo;s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. The European Commission has presented its plan to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that both the 2030 and 2050 targets will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. The Government has welcomed the European Green Deal and supports the ambition set out therein.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the investment required to decarbonise our economies, the EU&rsquo;s &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU recovery package and &euro;1 trillion budget require that money can only be spent on projects that meet certain green criteria, with 30% of all funding to go on climate change mitigation.\u00a0 Ireland will seek to maximise the drawdown of its share of this funding. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has a Green New Deal for Ireland as a core mission. It commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, the latter being consistent with EU 2050 ambition. The Climate Action (Amendment) Bill, currently in pre-legislative scrutiny, will strengthen the governance structure in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate breakdown, and will set the 2050 decarbonisation target in law.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This fundamental step change in ambition and broadening of our target horizon to a 7%\u00a0average emissions reduction per annum will be underpinned by the core philosophy of a Just Transition. We are committed to ensuring that no sector of society or community is left behind in the movement to a low-carbon future. The Just Transition Fund is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s just transition plan for the Midlands region. A 2020 fund of &euro;11 million is available for projects focusing on retraining workers and proposals to generate sustainable employment in green enterprise in the region, and supporting communities to transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to far-reaching policy changes across every sector to deliver this expanded and deepened climate ambition including: delivering a National Aggregated Model of Retrofitting reaching over 500,000 homes by 2030;\u00a0developing a major drive to realise the immense potential of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewables; and implementing a major Waste and Circular Economy Action Plan. The measures required to achieve the 2030 ambition will be set out in an updated Climate\u00a0Action Plan in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of national financing, &euro;30.4 billion is allocated for investment in climate action over the lifetime of Ireland's National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027. As part of the July Jobs Stimulus Plan, to help businesses adapt to the green economy, &euro;10 million will be provided to support businesses engaging in green research, development and innovation, capital investment, and capacity building, through the first phase of a new Green Enterprise Fund. Budget 2021 funding reflects this Government&rsquo;s ambition for a green, jobs-led recovery. In total, across Government, &euro;286.5 million has been committed to retrofit activity, and &euro;1.8 billion funding was announced for sustainable transport, cycling, walking, and greenways. The Government has announced a review of the National Development Plan, which will look at the appropriate amounts of funding across various areas such as climate action, housing and transport, and will be consistent with the Programme for Government.\u200b<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is preparing a National Recovery and Resilience Plan to be submitted to the European Commission by 30 April 2021 in order to receive funding under the EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Facility. Our plan will set out a coherent package of reforms and public investment projects to be implemented up to 2026 and will include measures aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the green and digital transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300091#WRO03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":662,"content":"<p>Question No. 264 answered with Question No. 262.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300091#WRO03800"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[33062\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300091#WRO03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the provision being made to provide community dividends in which renewable energy projects are being developed in communities and more specifically in the areas of wind generation, solar generation and hydro generation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This will allow these seven communities to develop their own renewable energy projects - five solar and two onshore wind - and sell the energy back to the grid providing further benefits to their localities. It is my intention that communities all over the country should be able to generate electricity and reap the benefits in their own localities from the sale of that electricity.

As set out in the Living with COVID-19 Framework, the Government broadly supported this effort to improve coordination within the Union and has made clear our intention to align with the new Recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Government made a decision on the approach to implementing the EU &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; system of categorising countries according to controls over the Covid-19 virus that was adopted on 13 October. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically the Government decided that persons arriving from green list locations can enter the State without the requirement to restrict movement or undergo testing for Covid-19. The default for persons arriving from orange or red locations should be to restrict movement for 14 days, with the exception of those exempted. The requirement on those arriving from orange locations to restrict movement could be dis-applied if they have negative test result of an appropriate pre-departure test carried out by an authorised entity (specific requirements to be confirmed). While the current requirement to restrict movement for 14 days following arrival from a red region remains until further notice, the Government agreed that as soon as practicable, passengers arriving from red regions should have the option to dis-apply the requirement to restrict movement following a negative result from an approved Covid-19 test taken five days after arrival. The same restrictions that apply for arrivals from red locations will apply for arrivals from grey locations.<\/p>  <p>  A senior group is to report back to Government by the 10th of November with a plan to establish a regime for testing for arrivals from red list regions.   <\/p>  <p>  For as long as the ECDC continues to report in data for the UK, that arrivals from Great Britain be subject to the same traffic light categorisation and restrictions as set out above for EU countries.

If the answer to any of these questions is &lsquo;yes&rsquo;; the passenger should not be permitted passage. <\/p>  <p>  The Government also agreed to maintain the position that no restrictions will be applied to International Transport workers. In addition and, in accordance with the EU Recommendation, travellers with an essential function or need should not be required to undergo restricted movement or testing while exercising this essential function. <\/p>  <p>  The Passenger Locator form will remain in place for all persons arriving into the State regardless of the colour location they are arriving from.

Since the publication of the 2018 report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to Continental Europe under close review, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>Since early 2019 my Department together with the IMDO has consulted closely with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders regarding the issue of direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe.  Shipping companies have assured my Department and the IMDO that they will respond to any increases in demand for direct maritime connectivity when border controls between the EU and the UK are introduced, and shipping companies have been adding capacity on routes to the Continent even during the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-2020. <\/p><p>The IMDO have very recently completed a review of the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 Landbridge Study and, in particular, the issue of direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.  The IMDO review confirmed that, at present, there is sufficient capacity on existing services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum.  The IMDO review will be published shortly.  In addition, my Department in conjunction with the IMDO has recently completed a further round of consultation with shipping companies serving Ireland regarding the issue of direct maritime connectivity at the end of the transition period.  <\/p><p>Given the spare capacity already available on routes from Ireland to Continental Europe and the spare freight carrying capacity of shipping companies serving Ireland and in the European shipping industry generally, identified by my Department and the IMDO, I am confident, including based on experience during the Covid-19 pandemic, that the shipping industry will respond quickly to any increase in demand for direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe from January 2021 onwards.  Any State intervention to provide direct shipping services in that context would be likely to undermine and disrupt a market response resulting in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place, legal challenges, and breaches of state aid rules with the requirement for repayment of any state aids provided with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any shipping companies receiving such aid.<\/p><p>As set out in the Government&rsquo;s updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published on 9th September 2020, businesses are being asked to consider moving, in advance of the end of the transition period, to direct route options for the movement of goods between Ireland and the Continent, to avoid potential delays and the new procedures that will be introduced associated with using the UK landbridge.  Shipping companies should also continue to assess expected future demand requirements and remain ready to respond to increased capacity demands, and all the indications are that this is happening. <\/p><p>My Department, together with the IMDO, Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments and Agencies has recently launched a renewed communications campaign, <b>ACT<\/b>, which encourages importers and exporters to focus on the direct route option now.  The <b>ACT<\/b>campaign encourages stakeholders:-<\/p><p>- To <b>Assess<\/b>their current routes to market;<\/p><p>- To <b>Communicate<\/b>their future needs clearly to shipping companies, and<\/p><p>- To <b>Trial <\/b>alternative services so that disruption to the UK Landbridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets.<\/p><p>More information on this campaign can be found on the IMDO website here: .<\/p><p>My Department, together with the IMDO, is continuing to closely monitor and keep under review the situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports, and will remain in close consultation with shipping companies, ports, hauliers, and other relevant stakeholders on this issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300093#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300093#WRQ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[32362\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300093#WRQ01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will allow access to the testing centre toilets and facilities, or seek an appropriate solution in the interests of public health, in view of the fact that driver instructors are legally required to accompany their learner drivers to test centres for their tests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>While it is the case that a learner driver must be accompanied by a fully licensed driver at all times, there is no requirement in law for driving instructors to attend test centres with learners sitting driving tests. <\/p>  <p>  Operational arrangements at test centres are a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and appropriate social distancing measures across the network. New Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions.  <\/p><p>There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.<\/p><p>The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.  In addition, the Government introduced a new temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services.<\/p><p>The Government's  <i>Living with Covid Plan<\/i>, clearly sets out the guidance and restrictions that will apply for all sectors, including public transport, at the 5 levels of the Plan, including strong messaging that people should use active travel as an alternative where this is feasible.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, most notably, frontline workers and those needing to travel to education.  <\/p><p>The move to 25% capacity utilisation on public transport is amongst the measures introduced under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, following recommendations made to Government by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).  Issues arising from the reduction of capacity arose on some services at the commencement of Level 5, in particular on some early morning bus services. The problem was most acute on buses early in the morning, particularly in the Dublin region. The return of schools this week is likely to again put the public transport system under pressure.<\/p><p>The NTA  issued a statement on their website on 20 October 2020 which says that they will look at &ldquo;<i>particular pressure points<\/i>&rdquo; in relation to public transport should the need arise, with a view to addressing them at local level. Since the implementation of Level 5 restrictions, Dublin Bus for example has redeployed additional vehicles to address particular problem areas, where possible, to mitigate the impact of capacity pressures on the network. I would like to thank operators and their staff, particularly drivers, who continue to provide a service in difficult circumstances to ensure essential workers and students can get to work and school.<\/p><p>Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice. The NTA advise that the situation on Monday 2nd November, the return of schools following the mid-term beak, was much improved with a reduced level of capacity problems notified by transport operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300095#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":854,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300095#WRS02300"},{"type":"question","counter":855,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[33188\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300095#WRS02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to issue refunds if requested by the person (details supplied); if he plans to minimise the waiting times in view of the restrictions in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1628","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":875,"content":"<p>The continued operation of the public transport sector is important and, from a very early stage in the Covid-19 crisis, public transport was designated by Government as among the essential services that could continue throughout the emergency.  Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and appropriate social distancing measures across the network. New Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions.  <\/p><p>There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.<\/p><p>The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.  In addition, the Government introduced a new temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services.<\/p><p>The Government's  <i>Living with Covid Plan<\/i>, clearly sets out the guidance and restrictions that will apply for all sectors, including public transport, at the 5 levels of the Plan, including strong messaging that people should use active travel as an alternative where this is feasible.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, most notably, frontline workers and those needing to travel to education.  <\/p><p>The move to 25% capacity utilisation on public transport is amongst the measures introduced under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, following recommendations made to Government by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).  Issues arising from the reduction of capacity arose on some services at the commencement of Level 5, in particular on some early morning bus services. The problem was most acute on buses early in the morning, particularly in the Dublin region. The return of schools this week is likely to again put the public transport system under pressure.<\/p><p>The NTA  issued a statement on their website on 20 October 2020 which says that they will look at &ldquo;<i>particular pressure points<\/i>&rdquo; in relation to public transport should the need arise, with a view to addressing them at local level. Since the implementation of Level 5 restrictions, Dublin Bus for example has redeployed additional vehicles to address particular problem areas, where possible, to mitigate the impact of capacity pressures on the network. I would like to thank operators and their staff, particularly drivers, who continue to provide a service in difficult circumstances to ensure essential workers and students can get to work and school.<\/p><p>Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice. The NTA advise that the situation on Monday 2nd November, the return of schools following the mid-term beak, was much improved with a reduced level of capacity problems notified by transport operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300095#WRS04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Metropolitan Area Networks Programme","counter":876,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300095#WRS04500"},{"type":"question","counter":877,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[33236\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300095#WRS04600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will clarify the terms of options to be explored in the feasibility study on extending the metro to the south west and the weighting for each of the criteria assessed under each option.","asker":"1554","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":878,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

","asker":"1519","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":990,"content":"<p>The payment breaks coordinated by the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) and introduced by its Members last March was a welcome initiative that allowed important and necessary cash flow relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers affected by Covid-19, including SMEs. As the Deputy is aware, the original 3 month payment break was extended by another 3 months for borrowers that requested it.  <\/p><p>As these expire, many borrowers are returning to repayment but many other borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are still facing, and they will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders.  This point was made very clear to the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks, and to the BPFI, by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself when we met them at the end of September.  It was also indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  These arrangement could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. Each individual&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.  <\/p><p>The Central Bank expects all lenders to develop strategies and operational capability to continue to support borrowers who cannot return to full capital and interest repayments after the end of the payment break. This will include offering forbearance as required and restructuring of loans in the event of long-term affordability issues.  <\/p><p>With regard to loans to SMEs, regulated financial service providers are required to comply with the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015, which are generally referred to as the SME Regulations.  These set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty.  <\/p><p>The SME Regulations also specify that borrowers must be informed about a regulated entity&rsquo;s internal appeal process in respect of a decision on whether to grant an alternative arrangement.  The SME Regulations also state that borrowers with participating lenders should be informed of the Credit Review Office where the participating lender&rsquo;s decision in relation to alternative arrangements are subject to review by the Credit Review Office.  The Credit Review Office () was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or have an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank or in relation to alternative arrangements for borrowers in difficulty. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the relevant participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB. <\/p><p>I would urge borrowers facing difficulties due to COVID-19 to contact their lenders as soon as possible to make alternative arrangements that will assist them to come through this difficult period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300098#WRV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":992,"qnumday":380,"qnumall":"[32318\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300098#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason Irish travel agents licensed by the Commission for Aviation Regulation are excluded from qualifying for the CRSS in view of the fact they have been trading in excess of 80% down since March 2020 and are likely to be a minimum 80% down until travel restarts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.<\/p><p>Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme.  Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.<\/p><p>Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment, which will be known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo; (&ldquo;ACTE&rdquo;). The ACTE will provide an immediate cash support to businesses. The amount of the ACTE will be based on an amount equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in the case of new businesses, the average weekly turnover in 2020) up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000.  This valuable upfront cash payment will enable eligible businesses to meet costs associated with their business premises, such as rent, insurance and utilities, at a time when, because of the specific terms of the restrictions announced by the Government, they cannot, for a period of time, provide goods or services to their customers or can only do so to a limited extent. <\/p><p>All eligible businesses can claim the support irrespective of their turnover levels, but the amount of the ACTE cannot exceed the lower of the amount based on 10%\/5% of the relevant weekly turnover or &euro;5,000 per week.  <\/p><p>Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. <\/p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as a musician who does not perform from a fixed business premises or a coach or bus operator whose business is ordinarily operated from mobile vehicles, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) or a business in the tourism sector carrying on a trade consisting of, for example, the operation of a gallery or other cultural attraction, located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.<\/p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.<\/p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business, such as a travel agency, has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.  However, where customers of such a business are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing the business premises in which the business is ordinarily carried on, as may be the case with travel agents under level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19, the business may qualify for the CRSS.<\/p><p>Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support live entertainment in 2021, and existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable. <\/p><p>Businesses may also be able to benefit from the Live Performance Support Scheme details of which are available at .

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   <\/p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:<\/p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <\/p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; <\/p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; <\/p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  <\/p>  <p>A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgment found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance I acknowledge that the persons who successfully challenged the Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC are, on the basis of the Supreme Court decision, entitled to seek access to the Scheme. The Supreme Court decision raised complex issues, including the manner in which the persons concerned can access the Scheme, given that the Regulation which set out the medical eligibility criteria was not found to be invalid and given that the persons concerned were not assessed for a Primary Medical Certificate on the single criterion of being permanently and severely disabled. Notwithstanding this and in light of the Supreme Court decision I understand that the Medical Board of Appeal has issued Board Medical Certificates to the two successful litigants.   <\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p>  <p>  My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. <\/p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating.

The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in\/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the EWSS already contains sufficient flexibility to take account of changes in business circumstances and is targeted at employers across all sectors who are most in need of support.  <\/p>  <p>  For those who may not be eligible for the EWSS, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300098#WRV04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1036,"content":"<p>Question No. 388 answered with Question No. 386.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":1037,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300098#WRV05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1038,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[33440\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300098#WRV05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position in relation to the disabled drivers scheme and the VAT and VRT off the fuel for scheme recipients if a disabled driver purchases an electric car; if they will receive their VAT rebate if their car is powered on electricity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Consequently, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to note that current Government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is targeted on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems.  To achieve this aim there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>  - Investing almost &euro;1 billion on flood relief measures over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027;<\/p>  <p>  - the implementation of the Office of Public Works (OPW) flood relief management plans; and<\/p>  <p>  - maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in affected areas.<\/p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and industry representatives Insurance Ireland.  This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should in-turn provide a basis for the increased provision of flood cover in these areas by insurance firms.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which my Department attends, meets on a quarterly basis to support this information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that while there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance in affected areas between 2015 and 2019, many householders are still experiencing difficulties.

Over the last year it launched a public consultation on Climate Change and Insurance and subsequently met with interested parties.

The scheme was predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picked up.  The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income for the duration of the scheme.  Legally, however, there was no requirement for a minimum amount that the employer had to pay as a normal wages payment to an employee to top up the wage subsidy.  The reason there was no such requirement was that many businesses were forced to close completely and would have had no capacity to continue to pay employees&rsquo; wages.  The purpose of the TWSS was to get much needed financial assistance to employees, while retaining the employer \/ employee relationship which facilitated the early recommencement of normal business when conditions permitted. <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, were matters that were outside the remit of the TWSS.  Essentially, the scheme had no role in relation to the employer\/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Payments made under the TWSS are income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and USC. <\/p>  <p>  While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and are instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of the year (2020).<\/p>  <p>  Revenue will make a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees in January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement will also include information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months.  This was a welcome initiative and it allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers.<\/p><p>Banks have now provided for flexible options for borrowers who can recommence payments following a Covid-19 payment break, and the BPFI has produced a useful guide on this - www.bpfi.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Final-BPFI-Coming-off-the-COVID-19-Payment-Break.pdf<i><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>However, I am very conscious that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and that they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may be in difficulty now for the first time.

As the Deputies know, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself met the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks and the Banking Payments Federation Ireland on 28 September to discuss this matter and we indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  The lenders indicated that they will ensure that customers who have difficulties in meeting their loan repayments will be supported with a range of options so that a suitable arrangement can be agreed. <\/p><p>Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience mortgage or other loan difficulty because of Covid-19.  These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.  The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  Each individual&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.<\/p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support due to the economic impact of Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300099#WRW02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1071,"content":"<p>Question No. 405 answered with Question No. 386.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1072,"content":"<p>Question No. 406 answered with Question No. 380.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1073,"content":"<p>Question No. 407 answered with Question No. 404.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1074,"content":"<p>Question No. 408 answered with Question No. 380.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1075,"content":"<p>Question No. 409 answered with Question No. 398.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[32573\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300099#WRW03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the owner of a traditional funfair will qualify for the employment wage subsidy scheme or other financial support (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1078,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the number of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue having regard to the circumstances of the person concerned and the fact that he does not have any employees on the payroll and has not had any employees on the payroll during 2020, he is not eligible for the EWSS. <\/p>  <p>  That said, for those businesses who need further support the Government has made a number of other options available, such as the recently announced Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).

This scheme enables visitors that are resident outside the EU to benefit from VAT relief on goods purchased in Ireland and subsequently taken outside of the EU.  If the scheme applies to UK visitors post-Brexit without changes UK visitors will be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses, as purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues.  Due to the volume of passenger movements between the UK and Ireland, the volume of refund applications is likely to significantly increase which simultaneously heightens the risk of abuse of the Retail Export Scheme post Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, the measures in the Bill are precautionary and aim both to minimise the potential for abuse of the scheme and to reduce the possibility of diversion in retail consumption from Ireland to the UK, post Brexit.   <\/p>  <p>  The amended legislation proposed in the General Scheme of the Brexit Omnibus Bill 2020 provides for two elements to restrict the scheme.  The first is a new requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.  The second is to provide that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in value in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme.  This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive.  The monetary limit will apply in respect of all third country travellers who apply for a refund under the scheme, post commencement of the relevant sections. <\/p>  <p>  The Ireland\/Northern Ireland Protocol ensures that there will be no VAT Retail Export Scheme between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The Deputy will be aware that Revenue is statutorily bound to confidentiality in respect of taxpayer information and by law Revenue is prohibited from disclosing taxpayer information to third parties, including to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (or \"TCA 1997\") formalises taxpayer confidentiality and reassures taxpayers that their personal and commercial information disclosed to Revenue for tax purposes is protected against unauthorised disclosure by Revenue to third parties.  Revenue is also obliged by section 851A TCA 1997 to ensure that information about individual taxpayers or a small group of taxpayers cannot be deduced from any statistical reports or similar information published by Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s first query concerned the payment of dividends from an Irish tax resident company to a non-resident shareholder without deduction of Irish tax.  I am advised by Revenue that the general rule concerning dividend withholding tax or &ldquo;DWT&rdquo; is contained in section 172B TCA 1997.  This provides that DWT at a rate of income tax of 25% applies to all &lsquo;relevant distributions&rsquo; made by Irish resident companies, including payments of cash dividends.  The DWT must be deducted at the time the distribution is being made and paid to Revenue by the 14th of the following month, unless the company has satisfied itself that the recipient is entitled to receive the distribution without the deduction of DWT.  For example, section 172D(3) TCA 1997 provides an exemption from DWT in the case of certain non-resident persons which are resident for tax purposes in another EU Member State or a country with which Ireland has a double taxation treaty.  Therefore, where an Irish tax resident company pays a dividend to a non-resident shareholder meeting the criteria set out in section 172D(3) TCA 1997, DWT does not have to be deducted from the dividend payment by the Irish tax resident company.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s second query, I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the overall framework for the taxation of income from a trade consisting of petroleum activities, a trade which is the focus of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  The taxation of activities in the oil and gas sector is a specialised area and I am advised that Chapter 2 of Part 24 TCA 1997 contains a number of specific provisions which deal with the taxation of petroleum activities.  Petroleum activities includes both petroleum exploration activities and petroleum extraction activities.  For this purpose, petroleum has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 and includes &ldquo;any mineral oil or relative hydrocarbon and natural gas and other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons and their derivatives&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Companies involved in petroleum extraction activities incur significant costs in the context of both petroleum exploration activities and petroleum extraction activities and significant capital expenditure on production and development in connection with an oil or gas field.  I understand that on the commencement of a trade of petroleum extraction by a company, all of its past petroleum exploration expenditure is deductible against the income from its petroleum activity.  In addition, a 100% write down allowance is available for capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery, assets or other works, buildings or structures, used in the carrying on of a petroleum extraction activity.  This write down allowance is available from the date of production or development commenced in commercial quantities for the field in question.  I am advised that any unutilised allowances on petroleum exploration expenditure and capital expenditure on production or development of an oil or gas field can be carried forward to shelter income in future trading periods. <\/p>  <p>  Income from a trade consisting of petroleum activities is subject to corporation tax at the rate of 25%.  Furthermore, it is important to note, that petroleum activities are ring-fenced from other trading activities to prevent erosion of the tax base which would result from non-petroleum profits being sheltered by deductions in respect of the substantial costs attributable to petroleum development.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that the information outlined above is provided so as to be helpful to the Deputy and in the context of Revenue&rsquo;s specific confidentiality obligations.  It relates to the general taxation rules applying to the payment of dividends from an Irish tax resident company to a non-resident shareholder and a trade consisting of petroleum activities.  It does not relate to any specific entity or group of entities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300099#WRW04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":1088,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1089,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[32671\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 194 of 20 October 2020, if he will expand on the way in which the possibility of the State acting as an insurer for artists and the live events sector would decrease competition and the way in which he considers it would affect pricing; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1090,"content":"<p>In relation to my reply of 20 October in relation to the risk presented by the State acting as an insurer for artists and the live events sector, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the following factors. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically with regard to competition, the concern I have with such a proposal is that it could compound what some see as the &lsquo;cherry picking&rsquo; of risk within the market by insurers.  In turn, this could further decrease market competition for these or other sectors over the longer term, as some insurers may stop insuring specific risks, particularly if there is a view that a State company is willing to insure those lines of business that could be considered as being less profitable.  While potentially having a negative impact upon pricing and possibly on supply, this could also create a large Exchequer exposure if significant losses were incurred. <\/p>  <p>  Also of relevance to both competition and pricing is that any State insurer would be required to comply with the same prudential rules under the Solvency II Directive, as private companies.  The Deputy will be aware that the Solvency II Directive is designed to allow for a level playing field across the European Union for insurers, not only in terms of market access, but also with regard to the level of supervision and tregulation.  Accordingly, the Directive plays an essential role in facilitating competition in the insurance sector across the EU.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, could therefore direct the pricing or provision of insurance at a rate lower than other commercial operators for these market segments as it could be deemed as anti-competitive behaviour.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the cost of any insurance provided by the State would still have to reflect the risk involved.  Consequently, there is no guarantee that cover could actually be provided, and if it were, there could be no certainty that it would be much cheaper than existing equivalent private insurance products.  Finally, there is no reason to believe that a State run insurer could provide cover in a more efficient way than a private one.  <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, any such proposals for State intervention, while well intended and which may appear as representing an easy solution, are likely to lead to unintended consequences, such as insurers withdrawing from further sectors on the presumption the State will insure loss-making risk.  These outcomes would undermine the primary policy goal of decreasing the cost of insurance and increasing the availability of insurance to consumers and businesses.   Accordingly, I am not convinced that a State-backed insurance scheme would be a solution to the cost or availability of insurance, either for the arts, entertainment and events industry or other market segments more generally. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax","counter":1091,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1092,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[32681\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will publish details of the changes to motor tax and VRT rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1093,"content":"<p>Details of the changes to motor tax and VRT are set out in the Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":1094,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1095,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[32747\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected publication date of a report on capping the cost of licensed moneylenders and other regulatory matters in response to the public consultation which opened for submissions on 31 May 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Personal use of the vehicle must be limited in this scenario and appropriate records should be kept, e.g. business mileage travelled in January 2020, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer, etc.<\/p><p>Employee Continues Working<\/p><p>Where an employee continues to undertake business travel as usual in an employer-provided vehicle, the usual BIK rules will apply.<\/p><p>Guidance on the above and other COVID-19 related matters can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website, available here.<\/p><p>Finally, the concessional treatment in this instance and in relation to all other matters is kept under regular review by Revenue and updated accordingly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":1104,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[32882\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the changes that have been made to benefit in kind in respect of electric vehicles; if he will address a potential anomaly (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1105,"content":"<p>I made no changes to the BIK regime for company vehicles in Budget 2021.

In Finance Act 2018 in order to ensure better value for money I limited this exemption to the first &euro;50,000 of the original market value (OMV) of the electric vehicle. <\/p>  <p>  What this means is that an employee or Director, who as part of their remuneration package is provided with an electric car for their private use, where that car has an original market value of &euro;50,000 and will be a low mileage car, will avoid paying PAYE, PRSI and USC on &euro;15,000 of notional income for every year they have the electric car.      <\/p>  <p>  This is an exceptionally generous BIK EV regime and by end 2022 it will have been in place 5 years.

Regulated entities must provide reasonable arrangements and\/or assistance to people who may be experiencing particular vulnerabilities, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19. All regulated firms should take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests, particularly in dealings with vulnerable consumers.<\/p><p>A review of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) is currently underway. Amongst other things, the review will consider whether the provisions that relate to vulnerability remain appropriate, and whether they need to be enhanced.  A public consultation on the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposals for amendments will take place in 2021 giving all stakeholders an opportunity to make submissions. This review will also include transferring the Code into regulations in line with the regulation making powers given to the Central Bank in the <i>Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013<\/i>.<\/p><p>The Code currently defines a vulnerable consumer as follows:<\/p><p><i>&ldquo;A &ldquo;vulnerable consumer&rdquo; means a natural person who:<\/i><\/p><p><i>a) has the capacity to make his or her own decisions but who, because of individual circumstances, may require assistance to do so (for example, hearing impaired or visually impaired persons); and\/or<\/i><\/p><p><i>b) has limited capacity to make his or her own decisions and who requires assistance to do so (for example, persons with intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties).&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Provision 3.1 of the Code provides that: &ldquo;Where a regulated entity has identified that a personal consumer is a vulnerable consumer, the regulated entity must ensure that the vulnerable consumer is provided with such reasonable arrangements and\/or assistance that may be necessary to facilitate him or her in his or her dealings with the regulated entity.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Provision 2.11 of the Code provides that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it &ldquo;without prejudice to the pursuit of its legitimate commercial aims, does not, through its policies, procedures, or working practices, prevent access to basic financial services&rdquo;. This provision aims to ensure that vulnerable people can gain access to mainstream financial services.<\/p><p>In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, banks are helping customers who are cocooning to manage their banking in a safe way without leaving their home. The retail banks have dedicated phone lines to assist cocooning customers during the COVID-19 crisis.<\/p><p>I would also like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) which is an independent statutory body with a statutory role in relation to financial education. The CCPC carries out this role by running public awareness campaigns on personal finance issues, providing online comparison tools for various financial products and providing personal finance information on its consumer website, including advice on avoiding scams. The CCPC also fulfils its statutory role in the development of financial education and capability by delivering financial education programmes for workplaces and schools and conducting research, such as the <i>Financial Capability and Well-being in Ireland in 2018 <\/i>study, to inform its financial wellbeing strategy and priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1112,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1113,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[32917\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter relating to the employment wage subsidy scheme with regard to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1114,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) commenced on 26 March 2020 as an emergency measure to provide income support to eligible employees where the employer&rsquo;s business activities were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Payments made under the TWSS and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), which is administered by the Department of Social Protection, are income supports and as such are taxable in nature. While the TWSS is liable to both income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC), the PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare type payments and is exempt from USC and PRSI charges. <\/p>  <p>  The EWSS operates differently to the TWSS in that it is a flat-rate subsidy that is payable to employers based on the number of eligible employees included on their payroll. Eligible employees are defined as those earning weekly gross wages of between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462. The EWSS also re- establishes the requirement for employers to operate the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; PAYE system each time they pay their employees and deduct income tax, USC and PRSI. These normal (real-time) deductions were not operated for TWSS payments, which will be taxed at year end.<\/p>  <p>  To minimise the end of year tax impact on employees who received TWSS payments, Revenue placed them on the &lsquo;week 1\/month 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation from 21 June 2020. The &lsquo;week 1\/month 1 basis&rsquo; preserves employees&rsquo; unused tax credits, which can then be offset against any accumulated tax liabilities at year end, including in respect of TWSS and PUP. Any additional credits that an employee may have, for example health expenses, may also be used to further reduce the accumulated tax liability. Any tax liability that still exists once all available credits have been offset can be paid over a four-year period from January 2022 by reducing the employee&rsquo;s tax credits for those years.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that, according to its records, the person in question received a combination of TWSS and PUP payments during the months of March to August 2020. Her employer also received EWSS subsidy payments for September 2020. In accordance with the rules of the TWSS, the payments were paid gross to her without &lsquo;normal&rsquo; income tax or USC deductions applying, which instead fall due at year end. <\/p>  <p>  The PUP payments received by the person from the Department of Social Protection during the period in question were also paid gross and the associated income tax liabilities, as with the TWSS, fall due at year end. <\/p>  <p>  The EWSS payments currently being received by the employer are flat-rate subsidies and have no direct bearing on the person&rsquo;s take-home pay and the employer is obliged to deduct income tax, USC and PRSI from her gross wage in the normal manner. The level of gross wage is a matter between the employer and the person.<\/p>  <p>  The person&rsquo;s exposure to tax on the subsidy amounts will be reduced by the tax credits that were preserved on her behalf through the &lsquo;week 1&rsquo; basis of taxation and may be reduced further if she has any additional credits to claim.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has also confirmed that it will make direct contact with the person in the coming days to explain how the subsidy schemes operate and to clarify the tax implications for her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme","counter":1115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1116,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[32986\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300100#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the reintroduction and extension of the home renovation incentive scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As the Deputy is aware, the original 3 month payment break was extended by another 3 months for borrowers that requested it.  <\/p><p>As these expire, many borrowers are returning to repayment but other borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are still facing, and they will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders.  This point was made very clear to the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks, and to the BPFI, by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself when we met them at the end of September.  It was also indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  These arrangement could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate, more long term arrangements. Each case is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.  <\/p><p>The Central Bank expects all lenders to develop strategies and operational capability to continue to support borrowers who cannot return to full capital and interest repayments after the end of the payment break. This will include offering forbearance as required and restructuring of loans in the event of long-term affordability issues.  <\/p><p>With regard to loans to SMEs, regulated financial service providers are required to comply with the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015, which are generally referred to as the SME Regulations.  These set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. It includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty.  <\/p><p>The SME Regulations also specify that borrowers must be informed about a regulated entity&rsquo;s internal appeal process in respect of a decision on whether to grant an alternative arrangement.  The SME Regulations also state that borrowers with participating lenders should be informed of the Credit Review Office where the participating lender&rsquo;s decision in relation to alternative arrangements are subject to review by the Credit Review Office.

Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.<\/p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300101#WRY01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":1153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300101#WRY02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1154,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[33417\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300101#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the objective of the carbon tax is to change consumer behaviour in favour of the environment; and the reason carbon tax is the same on smokeless coal as opposed to smoky coal that is still in use in a large geographical area of the State.","asker":"1463","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1155,"content":"<p>In 2009, the Commission for Taxation recommended the introduction of a tax on carbon emissions from fossil fuels released for consumption in Ireland in order to broaden the tax base and to protect and enhance the environment.

These guidelines were originally applicable until 30 June 2020 and their application was subsequently extended to 30 September 2020. On the 21 September 2020 the EBA announced that there would not be a further extension to the guidelines. The EBA has made no further official announcements in relation to the extension or reintroduction of guidelines on payment breaks. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering further payment breaks to borrowers. Lenders must however ensure that such a solution is appropriate for the individual borrower's circumstance.<\/p>  <p>  Lenders are expected to work with borrowers who are still experiencing repayment difficulty at the end of a COVID-19 payment break in a pro-active and sympathetic manner and with the objective of assisting borrowers to meet their mortgage commitments. It is important to note that in line with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), lenders can offer borrowers a variety of options depending on a number of factors specific to their own circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank recently stated that by early October, there were under 54,000 active payment breaks associated with Irish borrowers.

The three main retail banks assured the T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister McGrath and me at meetings in July that they were considering applications and mortgage drawdowns from customers on the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which replaced the TWSS, is to support employers by helping them to continue trade as they deal with risk arising from COVID-19, and this puts employers in a position to retain key staff and ensure the viability of businesses and firms.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the approach of regulated mortgage lenders on new mortgage lending, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.<\/p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300101#WRY03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1168,"content":"<p>Question No. 445 answered with Question No. 380.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1169,"content":"<p>Question No. 446 answered with Question No. 386.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1170,"content":"<p>Question No. 447 answered with Question No. 380.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1171,"content":"<p>Question No. 448 answered with Question No. 386.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1172,"content":"<p>Question No. 449 answered with Question No. 380.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":1173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300101#WRY04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1174,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[33844\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300101#WRY04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of data protection breaches identified within his Department in 2019.","asker":"1466","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1175,"content":"<p>There were 8 data protection breaches identified in the Department of Finance in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has an internal personal data breach reporting protocol.

","asker":"1567","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":1180,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 452 together.<\/p><p>In terms of the current tax treatment of the costs associated with working from home, the position is that any such costs incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business by an employer (for example, the provision of equipment) may be deducted by the employer in the normal course of calculating the tax liability of their business.<\/p><p>From the perspective of the individual employee, there is no specific tax credit available to employees where they work from home.  The consideration of the introduction of any such credit would need to balance a number of factors including issues of equity, noting that not every worker is able to work remotely or from home for a variety of reasons including the nature of their work and also the nature of their home environment.  <\/p><p>However, I am advised by Revenue that where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC. Where employers avail of this facility, they are not required to advise Revenue and therefore the number of employees reimbursed in this manner is not available. Where employers choose to pay more than &euro;3.20, the excess is subject to deduction of PAYE, PRSI and USC.<\/p><p>Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.<\/p><p>Revenue also advise that there has been no recent change in policy in relation to this payment.  This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 was, and still is, at the discretion of the employer.<\/p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.<\/p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, I am advised that employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use. <\/p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home. <\/p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website. I am advised by Revenue that where a deduction in respect of expenses in relation to working from home is claimed in a tax return, the amounts are included in a general &lsquo;Expenses&rsquo; field. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the number or value of specific claims in relation to these expenses.<\/p><p>I am advised that Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM e-Working and Tax.  <\/p><p><i>Finally, the 2020 Programme for Government: Our Shared Future<\/i>contains several commitments related to working from home, including an examination of the &ldquo;<i>feasibility and merits of changing tax arrangements to encourage more people to work remotely<\/i>&rdquo;, the responsibility for which falls to my Department.

","asker":"1466","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":1209,"content":"<p>Built on the performance budgeting framework that has been progressively embedded into the budget cycle, Equality Budgeting in Ireland has been developed over recent years with a view to enhancing the role of resource allocation policies in advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights. The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also contains a related commitment.  <\/p>  <p>  Equality budgeting should not be regarded as something separate from the budget process; the intention is to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process. <\/p>  <p>  The pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high-level goals articulated remains a matter for the individual line Departments in the first instance. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate and advance this initiative and provide support for Departments to clarify and to fulfil their equality-related objectives. <\/p>  <p>  Six departments participated in the Equality Budgeting pilot: Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Department of Health, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Following work to expand the programme, three further departments are now reporting on Equality Budgeting goals; Department of Justice and Equality, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment. As work to progress the programme continues, it is expected that a number of further departments will begin reporting on equality goals later this year.  <\/p>  <p>  To further guide the rollout of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department, in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published in tandem with Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. <\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the OECD recommendations has already commenced and is being informed also by the views of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group. One example of progress is in relation to recommendation 9, which calls for the development of an equality data strategy to further bolster the impact of equality budgeting. Monitoring and reporting from a given dimension of equality is only possible if the necessary disaggregated data is available. With this in mind, the CSO has conducted a data audit to evaluate the quality of existing administrative datasets from an equality perspective. This audit has been guided by a sub-group of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and is published on the CSO website at: www.cso.ie\/en\/methods\/methodologicalresearch\/rp-eda\/equalitydataaudit2020\/. Having a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape is a necessary prerequisite to implementing the remaining recommendations of the OECD report. <\/p>  <p>  In the Programme for Government, the Government has also set out its commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring; use these well-being indicators, as well as economic indicators, to highlight inequalities and ensure that policies are driven by a desire to do better by people; and ensure that the well-being framework will be utilised in a systematic way across government policymaking (at local and national levels) in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress (as an important complement to existing economic measurement tools).<\/p>  <p>  At present, officials in my Department are developing a programme of work that will support the Government in meeting this commitment with regard to well-being.  This work programme will be progressed on a cross-Governmental basis in liaison with the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Finance and other government departments as well as key stakeholders and experts in this area. Once developed, the framework will complement existing economic measurement tools that are in place to support well-being and outcomes-based approaches to policy making.<\/p>  <p>  One such existing tool is the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH Model, which will continue to be utilised to help Government understand the impact of proposed reforms on households. Moreover, initiatives such as the Spending Review process, which is a key platform for evidence-informed policymaking across the Civil Service, will continue to produce evidence relevant to the wellbeing and outcomes of people, households, businesses and sectors of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Taken as a whole, a broad range of initiatives are under way to advance the objectives of equality budgeting, deliver on the OECD recommendations step-by-step, and in particular to promote transparency and accountability in reporting across the budget cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300102#WRZ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Bodies","counter":1210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300102#WRZ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1211,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[32784\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300102#WRZ03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way in which the SEUPB will operate post-Brexit; if it will continue to be jointly chaired by him and the Northern Ireland Finance Minister; if changes are to be made in its operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As such, spending can be expected to run significantly ahead of profile for the remainder of the year. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;60,000 million, is &euro;8,662 million, or 16.9% above profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;5,547 million, is &euro;58 million, or 1% below profile and up &euro;886 million, or 19% on October 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Additional resources allocated to Departments in respect of Covid-19 for 2020 were reflected in the Pre-Budget Expenditure Update, published on October 6th. This expenditure, as well as additional measures announced as part of Budget 2021 was also reflected in the 2020 expenditure ceiling published in Expenditure Report 2021, published on Budget Day, October 13th  . These additional allocations were also set out at a Departmental level in the report, in order to allow for oversight of where additional funds are going. The majority of this additional expenditure has been reflected in 2020 Estimates presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, with the remainder to be presented in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to Health spending in particular, a Budget Oversight Group was established in 2019 to monitor health spending and act as an early warning mechanism. The Budget Oversight Group is made up of senior representatives from DPER, D\/Health and the HSE The overarching purpose of the group is to monitor health current expenditure and staffing within budget allocations and act as an early warning mechanism for any deviations. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, this group meets on a regular basis and the minutes of each meeting are published on the DPER website here: www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/31f5d3-hbog-finance-subgroup-minutes\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300103#WRAA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":1255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300103#WRAA02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1256,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[33624\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300103#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he received correspondence from a local authority regarding flood defence works (details supplied).

In this context I have taken the opportunity to meet with the relevant parties involved in these schemes to hear at first hand their issues of concern. <\/p>  <p>  The particular matter raised by the Deputy is a complex one that raises significant policy, legal and exchequer cost issues. The Deputy may be aware that the State is not the employer of the workers concerned. A detailed scoping exercise was carried out  in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications, in both cost and precedent terms, of the issues involved. The outcome to the scoping exercise was that the matter has potentially very significant implications for the exchequer, particularly if consequential demands were to be made by all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors. <\/p>  <p>  This is a factor which must be borne in mind in our approach to this issue. While CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors represent a small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, consideration must be taken for the potential liability to the State if similar claims are made by the many workers in the broader community and voluntary sector. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, we are now facing major challenges in managing the public finances.

This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities such as going to leisure and fitness facilities and there are no plans to deem leisure and fitness facilities as essential services. <\/p>  <p>  The Government fully understands the benefits that such facilities provide to peoples overall health and well-being and understands how difficult the public health measures are for individuals and businesses. The measures in place to suppress the disease transmission are intended to minimise the risks to public health while striking the right balance in prioritising and protecting some activities over others. Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests (in so far as possible) such as sports and important family gatherings. <\/p>  <p>  Each level of the framework contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the impacts COVID-19 and the related public health measures are having on our mental health and well-being.

The only facilities not covered by this requirement are those set out in the public health regulations concerned. Given the prevailing incidence of covid in the community generally, there are no plans to alter the current Level 5 measures for these facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Framework for Restrictive Measures is a risk management strategy designed to allow individuals, families, businesses and services better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures Government might introduce to stop escalation of the transmission of the disease.<\/p>  <p>  It is framed to account for periods where there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters, low community transmission, through to situations where there is high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. Notwithstanding the emergence of some encouraging trends in recent days, the latter is clearly the position currently pertaining in Ireland, in common with many other countries and relaxation of current measures is not envisaged in current circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy, in line with the public health advice, is disease suppression. COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. The risk of infection spread is greater in certain environments than others e.g. uncontrolled environments, crowded and noisy places, indoor environments, poorly ventilated spaces. A range of public health measures and guidance is in place to help prevent transmission.<\/p>  <p>  The framework takes account of the societal and economic impacts of the response to COVID-19. Nuanced and sectoral responses are in place to ensure the number of people impacted will be kept to the minimum necessary to control the disease given the psycho-social impacts of the disease on the population.<\/p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation with high incidence of disease, widespread community transmission, and growing hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue.

Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests such as sports and important family gatherings. <\/p>  <p>  Each level of the framework contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is fully aware of the impacts that COVID-19 and the related public health measures are having on our mental health and well-being.

Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests (in so far as possible) such as sports and important family gatherings. <\/p>  <p>  Each level of the framework contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the impacts COVID-19 and the related public health measures are having on our mental health and well-being. The &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign, launched on 29th October, is aimed at showing people of all ages how we can mind our own physical and mental health and wellbeing by adding healthy and helpful habits to our daily and weekly routines.  It provides guidelines, information, and tips on things that will help us keep well through the coming months.

Landowners may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Conservation","counter":1501,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1502,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[33804\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the extent to which various native bird species including songbirds are extinct or are threatened with extinction; the extent to which conservation measures are in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1503,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[33806\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of predatory birds here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1504,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 566 and 568 together.<\/p><p>My Department is responsible for the implementation of the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, both of which underpin the legislative and policy framework for the protection and conservation of our natural heritage.

These include the Golden Eagle (in 1912), the White-tailed Eagle (early 20th C.) and the Red Kite became extinct as breeding species in Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From the early 21st century, these species have been subject to re-introduction programmes which have seen the species re-establish a foothold once again.  Current population estimates (based on numbers of breeding pairs) are detailed in Table.  <\/p><p>The Hen Harrier population has been monitored in recent decades through national surveys with the fourth and most recent survey completed in 2015. The short-term trend 2005-2015, indicates a decline of 9.7% in the national population. Changes in land-use caused by the intensification of agriculture and afforestation are considered to be the most important drivers among others of this population.<\/p><p>Farmers in Hen Harrier areas (SPAs and areas identified in the national 2015 survey) are eligible for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine's agri-environmental schemes known as GLAS and GLAS+. DAFM has estimated that more than &euro;23m per annum is available for Hen Harrier actions alone in GLAS and GLAS+. As of August 2019, some 2,617 farmers had taken up these measures in GLAS and 1,506 in GLAS+. <\/p><p>Since 2017, the Hen Harrier Project supported by DAFM under the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) measure of the RDP was launched with a budget of &euro;25 million. Its main objectives include the sustainable management of farmland in the Hen Harrier SPAs, with a strong socio-economic focus in these marginal agricultural areas, and fostering good relations through locally-led solutions between farmers, state bodies and other stakeholders.  The project incentivises farmers to manage their land in ways that will improve habitat condition for the benefit of Hen Harrier. <\/p><p>Approximately 30% of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird species assessed are estimated to have remained stable or increased in abundance over the long-term. This cohort includes those relatively recent colonists with strong population growth including Little Egret, Great Skua, Mediterranean Gull, Little Ringed Plover, Bearded Tit and Great Spotted Woodpecker. However these recent additions to Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird community need to be viewed in the context that almost 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird species, for which we have data, are considered to be in long term decline. <\/p><p>Some of our breeding farmland songbirds have been flagged in recent decades as being particularly vulnerable to the modernisation and intensification of agricultural practices. This ongoing change in agricultural practices has led to the extinction of Corn Bunting as a breeding bird in Ireland and has been a primary driver of long term declines in species such as Corncrake, Yellowhammer, Whinchat and Twite for example. The latter two species&rsquo; estimated populations are now considered to be both less than 100 pairs. <\/p><p>Countryside Bird Survey data for two ground nesting songbird species which are still relatively abundant and widespread, namely Meadow Pipit and Skylark, were used for this reporting round. Their preferred breeding habitats include peatlands and unimproved grasslands, and both populations are in decline with the estimated short term abundance of Meadow Pipit declining by over 12% and for Skylark by almost 11%. Over the last 40 years or so the estimated breeding range of the latter has decreased by almost one quarter. Such estimated declines are of particular concern as both Meadow Pipit and Skylark make up significant proportions of the prey base of some of Ireland&rsquo;s raptors of conservation concern including Merlin, Kestrel and Hen Harrier. The short term declines for the latter two raptors are estimated to be circa 28% and 10% respectively. <\/p><p>Breeding waders as a group continue to suffer significant declines in both population and breeding range, in both the short- and long-term. Species such as Curlew, Lapwing, Redshank and Dunlin, all of which nest on the ground, have declined by 93% or more in the long term. Certain breeding duck populations are also of concern with numbers of breeding Common Scoter continuing to decline to critically low levels. While this species&rsquo; range is stable, the population has declined 21-54% in the short-term and 61% in the long-term. The latest assessment of breeding Red-breasted Merganser (which was reproduced from the 2008-2012 reporting period due to a lack of contemporary data) estimates that this breeding population has declined 62% in the short-term.<\/p><p>The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding seabird species&rsquo; long term population trends are now reckoned to be either stable or increasing. It is possible that the increased level of breeding seabird survey effort undertaken by my department over recent year may be partially responsible for some of these recorded gains. Kittiwake stands out among the seabird cohort where there is now a strong evidence base to conclude that the population is under a sustained and significant decline. Further work on understanding the drivers of this decline is required but indications that a lack of available forage fish may play a role.<\/p><p>Of particular note are the very strong population increases with several of our breeding tern species (e.g. Roseate Tern, Sandwich Tern, Little Tern and Common Tern). At the site level it is evident that targeted conservation measures in the form of wardened tern colonies is resulting in direct and effective conservation positives.  However several of these particular species&rsquo; estimated long-term breeding range trends are in decline or stagnant which not only reinforces the need for such conservation management interventions but also clearly sets out the on-going obligation that such conservation initiatives are to be maintained or where necessary improved. <\/p><p>Robust and contemporary population estimates have been produced for approximately 85% of our breeding seabird species. Work is on-going in my Department with further surveys targeting seabirds such as Puffin, Manx Shearwater and Storm Petrel. These species whose colonies are located on offshore islands are particularly vulnerable to invasive mammals. Such survey work is needed to provide context and further targeting of the on-going bio-security conservation measures currently being carried out by my Department.<\/p><p>The vast majority of those wintering populations assessed as part of the Article 12 Reporting process relate to wintering waterbirds. This group includes ducks, geese, swans and waders among others. Due to its geographical location, climate and wetland habitats, Ireland is an important host for hundreds of thousands of visiting waterbirds during the non-breeding\/wintering seasons. Due to the relative sizes of their respective biogeographic populations, Ireland is of international importance for several waterbird species including Whooper Swan, Greenland White-fronted Goose, Brent Goose, and Black-tailed Godwit among others. The population trends for wintering birds varies by group and species. Wintering wader populations, for example, are largely showing continued population declines. While the trends for geese vary, with Greenland White-fronted Geese showing a continued recent decline, and others such as the Barnacle goose showing a positive long term trend. <\/p><p>A range of conservation measures have been put in place in an attempt to halt and reverse population declines for those most threatened bird species. The following examples are targeted at particular bird species but are likely have positive benefits for other species and habitats. <\/p><p>A new project, &quot;Crex LIFE&quot; has been established that will aim to reverse the declines in Corncrake populations, following on from the NPWS Corncrake scheme. The NPWS Curlew Conservation Programme continues to bolster conservation efforts for threatened breeding Curlew, with teams undertaking habitat management and community engagement in core areas. Further innovations for Curlew conservation are being developed by the DAFM-funded Curlew EIP. <\/p><p>The NPWS farm plans put in place conservation measures on priority farmland areas to benefit breeding waders, Chough, threatened passerines such as Whinchat, and various wintering geese and swans. NPWS also liaise with DAFM for the design and targeting of more widespread national agri-environment measures on farmland, which includes measures for: Curlew; breeding waders more generally; wintering geese and swans; threatened passerines such as Twite; Grey Partridge; Hen Harrier; and Twite. NPWS also run a Grey Partridge conservation programme based primarily at Boora, Co. Offaly, which also delivers benefits for breeding Lapwing and other ground-nesting birds such as Skylark. NPWS also implements measures for the rare breeding species Red-throated Diver. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Control","counter":1505,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1506,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[33805\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the extent to which the otter population has fluctuated in the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1507,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[33807\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the degree to which the red squirrel population has recovered here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1508,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 567 and 569 together.<\/p><p>Ireland continues to remain a stronghold for the European otter. Four national surveys have been conducted to date. The first in 1980\/81 found signs of otters throughout the country, at 88% of sites surveyed. There was some suggestion of declines in the survey results of 1990\/91 and 2004\/05 but the most recent survey (2010\/11) indicated recovery to 1980 levels. <\/p><p>The most recent distribution data show that the otter continues to be widespread throughout Ireland in a wide variety of habitat types. Otters have two basic requirements: aquatic prey and safe refuges where they can rest. In Ireland, otter populations are found along rivers, lakes and coasts, where fish and other prey are abundant, and where the bank-side habitat offers plenty of cover. <\/p><p>A total of 44 Special Areas of Conservation have been designated with  the otter as a qualifying interest. These comprise extensive stretches of river channels and coastline (including off-shore islands) as well as lakes and blanket bog systems. The main threats to the otter include pollution, particularly organic pollution resulting in fish kills, the removal of riparian vegetation, and accidental deaths (road traffic and fishing gear). The otter population (estimated at between 7,000 and 10,000 breeding females) is considered to be stable or increasing and none of the threats or pressures identified is considered to be impacting on the species at a population level. The overall status of otter is considered to be favourable.<\/p><p>The report from the last national otter survey can be downloaded here: <\/p><p>In 2019, the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service of my Department, co-funded a survey across the island of Ireland on the distribution and status of the native Red Squirrel. The survey also examined the distribution of the native Pine Marten and the invasive Grey Squirrel. The Grey Squirrel was introduced to Ireland just over 100 years ago and competes with the Red Squirrel for resources. It also carries a disease that is fatal to the native species. As a result, the spread of Grey Squirrel in the second half of the 20th Century was mirrored by a retraction in Red Squirrel range and a reduction in numbers. In recent surveys, however, it became apparent that in some parts of Ireland there had been a change in the fortunes of the two species. <\/p><p>In surveys conducted in 2007 and 2012 it was evident that the Grey Squirrel had disappeared from parts of the midlands of Ireland. This disappearance was linked in subsequent studies to the re-emergence of the Pine Marten, a native Irish carnivore. The Pine Marten had previously almost disappeared but has made a considerable recovery after becoming protected under Irish and EU legislation. High densities of Pine Marten were found in the midlands of Ireland, in the areas where Grey Squirrel had disappeared. Meanwhile, Red Squirrel had made a recovery in some of these areas and seemed capable of co-habiting woodlands with the native carnivore. <\/p><p>The 2019 survey sought to update the distribution maps for the three species in recognition of the rapidly changing situation and I am pleased to say that the results are very encouraging. Red Squirrel sightings have increased considerably, particularly in Ulster and Leinster, and it has returned to many parts of the midlands from which it had disappeared. The most marked increases in Red Squirrel sightings were in Co. Westmeath, Co. Offaly and Co. Laois, the areas from which the Grey Squirrel has disappeared from longest. The midlands gap in Red Squirrel distribution recorded in previous surveys has retracted, however it is still rare in much of Co. Meath, Co. Louth and Co. Dublin. Meanwhile the grey squirrel has continued to decline and is absent now from large areas of the midlands. Full details of the survey results, including the up to date map of the red squirrel&rsquo;s distribution, can be found in the online report here: <\/p><p>Of further note is the recent revision of the All-Ireland Red Data List of Mammals. The 2009 version of the List had included Red Squirrel as &ldquo;Near Threatened&rdquo; due to concerns about its decline and the threat posed by the grey squirrel. The updated Red List from 2019 now lists red squirrel as &ldquo;Least Concern&rdquo; in recognition of its improved status.<\/p><p>The 2019 All-Ireland Red Data List of Mammals can be downloaded here: <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1509,"content":"<p>Question No. 568 answered with Question No. 566.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1510,"content":"<p>Question No. 569 answered with Question No. 567.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1512,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[33942\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if floating regasification storage units typically used for liquefied natural gas transfer will be regulated under the National Marine Planning Framework; the nature of this regulation and timeline for implementation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1513,"content":"<p>The draft National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) was launched by my Department on 12 November 2019.

The Act also provides for permanently enhanced protections which were designed to ensure that tenants and landlords engage to address any rent arrears arising at the earliest juncture. <\/p><p>In rent arrears cases, a landlord is required to engage early by serving both the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and the tenant with a 28-day warning notice seeking payment of rent arrears. Upon receipt of the warning notice, the RTB acknowledges receipt to the landlord and the tenant and provides information to the tenant to enable them to get advice from the Money and Budgeting Advice Service (MABS) and offers assistance to the tenant in obtaining this advice.<\/p><p>The RTB and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) are working with tenants in rent arrears to outline the financial supports which may be available to enable the tenant to meet their rental obligations to sustain their tenancy. <\/p><p>Any subsequent notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the RTB and will be invalid if the associated rent arrears warning notice had not been served on both the RTB and the tenant.

Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021. <\/p><p>Tenants who are currently (or at any stage between 9 March 2020 and 10 January 2021):<\/p><p>- in receipt of (or entitled to receive) Illness Benefit for Covid-19 absence - further information available at - ); or<\/p><p>- in receipt of (or entitled to receive) the Temporary Wage Subsidy, Employment Wage Subsidy or any other social welfare payment or State support paid as a result of loss of earnings due to Covid-19 (this includes the rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance);<\/p><p>and<\/p><p>- at risk of losing their tenancy,<\/p><p>can receive the aforementioned protections to remain in their tenancy without any increase in rent until 11 January 2021. <\/p><p>In order to qualify for these supports, tenants must complete and sign a Self-Declaration form, available on the Residential Tenancies Boards (RTB) website - , if they meet the above criteria and submit it to the RTB and their landlord. <\/p><p>Tenants are required to pay rent to their landlord and, in the event of tenants having difficulty doing so on foot of Covid-19, they are encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity. <\/p><p>Many Government Departments, agencies and organisations are engaged in supporting landlords and tenants during this time, providing information, advice and income supports to those who are facing financial difficulty. Tenants facing difficulty in meeting the rental payments should engage with the Department of Social Protection (D\/SP) as income supports such as Rent Supplement and Social Welfare Allowances are available to assist them.<\/p><p>The D\/SP Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by providing assistance to those whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  There are several payments within the scheme including once-off exceptional needs payments (ENPs) which can cover rent arrears. Further information on these supports can be found by calling the D\/SP Income Support Helpline for Covid-19 on 1890 800 024 or by visiting the D\/SP website at: <\/p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to comment on or intervene in the specifics of any individual case. <\/p><p>My Department and the RTB urge landlords to consider the negative impacts of Covid-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears might arise. Tenants and landlords are urged to discuss any problems promptly, keep lines of communication open and respect each other&rsquo;s positions. If the problem cannot be resolved, registered landlords and all tenants can apply to the RTB for dispute resolution.

The Guidance document is available on the Department's website - - and on the RTB's website - .<\/p><p>The RTB has engaged with stakeholders with regard to the recent tenancy protection enhancements and launched advertising campaigns, including on social media, informing the public and directing people to its website for more information. The advertising campaigns ran from 15 April until to 1 August 2020 and the final phase of a related mail-shot to tenants and landlords concluded last week.<\/p><p>On 24 October 2020, the Residential Tenancies  Act 2020  was enacted and came into operation to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants and to support the efforts of Government in restricting the movement of people in order to suppress the spread of Covid 19. The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence. The current restriction to 5 km is due to expire on 1 December 2020. <\/p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 operates independently of, and complements, the provisions of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020. <\/p><p>At this time, a landlord can serve a warning notice  seeking payment of rent arrears and, if required, can serve a follow-up notice termination. Where the tenant has made the required declaration, the enhanced protections under the Residential Tenancies and Vaulation Act 2020 apply and the tenancy cannot be terminated until 11 January 2021. A landlord can refer a dispute to the RTB where he or she contests the applicability of enhanced protections under the Residential Tenancies and Vaulation Act 2020. <\/p><p>A tenant is obliged under section 16(c) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to allow, at reasonable intervals, the landlord, or any person or person acting on the landlord's behalf, access to the dwelling (on a date and time agreed in advance with the tenant) for the purposes of inspecting the dwelling.  A breach of this tenant obligation can also be referred to the RTB. A landlord may report anti-social behaviour to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for appropriate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1523,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1524,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[32351\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300108#WRFF05000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the funding allocated for the multi-annual programme by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1525,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme.<\/p><p>The allocations under the current multi-annual rural water programme were announced on 15 October, 2019. <\/p><p>All local authorities that submitted bids were informed of the outcome of their bids in a circular which included an overall and a breakdown of the allocations per county.

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic. There is no blanket ban on applications or drawdowns for RIHL applicants.<\/p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 situation has had an unprecedented economic impact and unfortunately some applicants for the RIHL have been affected. In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application\/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the fact that an applicant&rsquo;s income is supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) or its successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is a factor that must be taken into account. As noted on Revenue&rsquo;s website, employers&rsquo; participation in the TWSS scheme is &lsquo;a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, there will be, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.&rsquo;  This approach also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is now operational, where a decline of at least 30% in future turnover is projected for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020 for a participating business.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that the ability to repay a mortgage is based upon a careful assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s employment situation, the fact that their employer has declared that they are unable to pay normal wages must be taken into consideration. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, on 6 July, my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the TWSS as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. This also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).<\/p>  <p>  There are exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS or EWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.<\/p>  <p>  For applicants whose post-TWSS\/EWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS\/EWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS\/EWSS Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan amount and will enable them to commence the property search.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300110#WRHH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1592,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[32702\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300110#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of Rebuilding Ireland home loans that have been drawn down by applicants who went on the wage subsidy scheme after having received mortgage approval in principal by month in tabular form; and the number of applicants on the wage subsidy scheme who have received mortgage approval in principal on foot of an application submitted after they went onto the wage subsidy scheme.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1593,"content":"<p>My Department does not collect information on the number of Rebuilding Ireland home loans that have been drawn down by applicants who went on the wage subsidy scheme after having received mortgage approval in principal; or the number of applicants on the wage subsidy scheme who have received mortgage approval in principal on foot of an application submitted after they went onto the wage subsidy scheme.<\/p><p>My Department publishes information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.

It is evident that Funshinagh does not get a chance to &lsquo;reset&rsquo; its flood pattern each year.

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, it was estimated that local authorities would collect &euro;1.66 billion in rates in 2020 from approximately 150,000 commercial and industrial properties liable for payment, amounting to 29% of their overall projected revenue for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 was passed by the Oireachtas and enacted on 11 July 2019.  Key Elements of the Act include:<\/p>  <p>  A modernisation of rates legislation and practice, including variation of rates payment      arrangements;<\/p>  <p>  The pro-rata levying of rates on occupiers based on period in occupation within a year; <\/p>  <p>  The application of interest payments on unpaid rates; <\/p>  <p>  Minimum charges for vacant commercial premises;<\/p>  <p>  Potential Rates Waiver Scheme; and<\/p>  <p>  Amendment to Rate Limitation Order formula in place in the year following revaluation.<\/p>  <p>  These new provisions will add to the suite of options already available to local authorities to support local businesses and ratepayers.  Commencement of the various sections of the Act is under active consideration, and it had been intended that the bulk of the provisions would be operational for the 2021 local authority budget cycle, in November 2020.  However, commencement has been delayed due to the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  In recognising the difficulties faced by businesses, the Programme for Government &ndash; &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;, in the area of &ldquo;Reigniting and Renewing the Economy,&rdquo; committed to set out how commercial rates will be treated for the remainder of 2020.  One of my earliest priorities as Minister was to secure funding to provide a waiver of commercial rates for businesses impacted by the pandemic, while simultaneously supporting local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;600m was allocated by Government to fund the cost of a six-month waiver of rates from 27 March to 27 September, which took the form of a credit in lieu of rates.  To strengthen this support, in Budget 2021, the Government announced an extension of the waiver until 27 December 2020, at an additional cost of &euro;300m.  The criteria for the extended waiver remains the same and it is intended that the waiver for the final quarter will be automatically applied to rate accounts that benefitted from the six-month waiver.  This brings to  &euro;900m the financial support to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates, which is an unprecedented measure that offers support to businesses and certainty to local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for Government, on the subject of Local Government committed to examine ways to further streamline the commercial rates system post COVID-19.  Consideration will be given to the area of commercial rates when there is greater certainty regarding the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the maximum limits that apply to their administrative areas. My Department does not monitor how each individual authority sets their income limit as the income limit is set by Regulation and not by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. <\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the income limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. <\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. <\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300111#WRJJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Contracts","counter":1651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300111#WRJJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1652,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[33275\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300111#WRJJ03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of contracts approved in his Department in 2019 and to date in 2020 without competitive tender; the details of the contract; the company awarded the contract; and the full value of the contract in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1653,"content":"<p>In accordance with Circular 40\/2002, issued by the Department of Finance, my Department completes an annual return in respect of contracts above a &euro;25,000 threshold which have been awarded without a competitive process.

627 and 628 together.<\/p>  <p>As the question appears to refer to a particular (i.e 'the') An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision, it is important to clarify at the outset that under Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, I am precluded from exercising and power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la may be concerned.  I am not, therefore, in a position to comment or make a statement on any individual planning case. <\/p>  <p>  Generally, when making a decision on a planning application that is subject to appeal, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned and the potential effects on the environment of the proposed development, having regard to a range of matters specified in legislation, including the provisions of the relevant development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any statutory guidelines and specific planning policy requirements under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning Act, the Board may, in determining an appeal, and in the case of Strategic Infrastructure Development applications made directly to the Board, decide to grant permission even if the proposed development would contravene materially the development plan of the relevant planning authority. <\/p>  <p>  In cases on appeal, where a planning authority has refused an application for planning permission for a proposed development because it would contravene materially the local development plan, the Board may, under the provisions of the Planning Act, grant planning permission for proposed development that materially contravenes the development plan in the following circumstances:- Where the Board considers that: the proposed development is of strategic or national importance; there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the proposed development is concerned, or permission should be granted having regard to the regional spatial and economic strategy for the area, statutory guidelines, statutory policy directives, the statutory obligations of any local authority in the area, and any relevant policy of the Government or any Minister of the Government; or permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to the pattern of development, and permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan.<\/p>  <p>   Similar provisions also apply to applications for Strategic Housing Development (SHD), which are made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, where 100 or more residential units are proposed.<\/p>  <p>The Urban Development and Building Heights Guidelines for Planning Authorities, published by my Department in 2018, also address this issue.  Specific Planning Policy Requirement (SPPR) 3(A) of the Building Height Guidelines provides that where an applicant for planning permission sets out how a development proposal complies with the relevant criteria and the assessment of the planning authority concurs, taking account of the wider strategic and national policy parameters, then the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la may approve such development, even where specific objectives of the relevant development plan or local area plan may indicate otherwise.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to better align decision making processes between local authority development plans and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of overall Government policy, the Building Height Guidelines require planning authorities to identify through their statutory plans, areas for increased building height, where appropriate, and to not provide for blanket numerical limitations on height (SPPR1).  This work is underway as part of statutory planning processes in many local authority areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300111#WRJJ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":1658,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300111#WRJJ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1659,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[33296\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300111#WRJJ04100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he or his officials have had discussions with local authorities individually or collectively regarding encouraging increased density in housing developments; if so, the number of meetings and contacts and with which local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1660,"content":"<p>It is a key objective of Project Ireland 2040, which includes the National Planning Framework (NPF), to encourage a shift in the pattern and format of future development towards more compact urban growth, as a mechanism to support proper planning and sustainable development and as a measure to address climate change.  The National Planning Framework is endorsed in the current Programme for Government, which also includes a commitment towards a &lsquo;town centre first&rsquo; principle, in support of more balanced regional and rural development.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than introduce new or increased requirements, both the NPF and the Programme for Government underpin pre-existing requirements for residential density.  The National Planning Framework restates the commitment to implement statutory planning guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas, published by my Department in 2009.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas generally require densities in the range of 35-50 dwellings per hectare (dph) on outer suburban\/greenfield sites.  The Guidelines also provide scope for densities below 35 dph on more peripheral sites in smaller towns and villages, in particular to assist in delivering more sustainable alternatives to dispersed rural housing.  These requirements have been established Government policy for a significant period of time, dating back to the late 1990&rsquo;s.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to have ongoing engagement with the Local Authority sector, including individual local authorities, on a wide range of policy issues, including those relating to planning, which may from time-to-time include residential density.  However, as policy on this issue is long established, the focus of engagement with local authorities is on the broad implementation of national policy and not on individual developments or development proposals.<\/p>  <p>  It is noted in particular, that the assessment of individual planning applications is carried out on a case-by-case basis by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in accordance with the requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, having regard to planning guidance and other relevant factors.

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 situation has had an unprecedented economic impact and unfortunately some applicants for the RIHL have been affected. In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application\/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the fact that an applicant&rsquo;s income is supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) or its successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is a factor that must be taken into account. As noted on Revenue&rsquo;s website, employers&rsquo; participation in the TWSS scheme is &lsquo;a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, there will be, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.&rsquo;  This approach also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is now operational, where a decline of at least 30% in future turnover is projected for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020 for a participating business.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that the ability to repay a mortgage is based upon a careful assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s employment situation, the fact that their employer has declared that they are unable to pay normal wages must be taken into consideration. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, on 6 July, my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the TWSS as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. This also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).<\/p>  <p>  There are exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS or EWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.<\/p>  <p>  For applicants whose post-TWSS\/EWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS\/EWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS\/EWSS Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan amount and will enable them to commence the property search.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300112#WRKK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1687,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300112#WRKK02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1688,"qnumday":639,"qnumall":"[33680\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300112#WRKK02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 134 and 135 of 14 October 2020, if existing planning permissions that have already been granted a five-year extension of duration will also benefit from the 56 days or eight weeks Covid-19 related extension.","asker":"1517","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1689,"content":"<p>As indicated in the previous reply of 14 October last on this matter, in light of the impacts of the Covid-19 emergency, the Government, on 29 March 2020, made an Order under section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), which resulted in the extension of time for a range of specified or appropriate periods and timelines in the Planning Acts and associated planning regulations.

This year, Sudan has been the top recipient of funds from the CERF and since 2018 has received &euro;137.5 million from the Fund to support critical life-saving humanitarian needs.  Other relevant humanitarian instruments to which Ireland contributes include the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), which has committed over &euro;61 million to humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year and &euro;580 million since 2011 for life-saving assistance to people in Sudan.

This advice is to avoid non-essential overseas travel due to the potential for exposure to COVID-19 and the risk this poses both for the individual and for the wider community. <\/p>  <p>  The nature of election observation missions is such that the chance of exposure is higher still, given that such missions entail not only travel to the destination country but extensive travel within the destination country, and the probability of close contact with residents as well as other election observers coming from other countries with varying COVID-19 incidence rates. As well as potential exposure of Irish election observers to infection, and the implications for their families and communities on return, we must also be mindful of the risk of election observers themselves exposing others to COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  As we are well aware here in Ireland, having moved to Level 5 measures, the pandemic has not abated and our main priority must remain the health of volunteers and their wider circles of contact, both at home and abroad.

In this respect, Department of Foreign Affairs officials are monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis and, given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, will continue to evaluate as they arise any calls for election observers from the OSCE and EU.

It is of particular concern that levels of violence against those supporting the implementation of the 2016 Peace Agreement, including through the programme for voluntary crop substitution, appear to have increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia.<\/p><p>I understand that the person, details supplied, who was murdered on 3 October 2020 in Cauca was active in advocating for the right of farmers to have access to supports for voluntary crop substitution programmes.  His death, along with the recent death of a colleague of his, is yet another loss to Colombian civil society which continues to work towards full implementation of the Peace Agreement. Cauca is one of a number of Departments in Colombia where the activity of illegal armed groups has increased during the pandemic, with levels of violence also increasing as the groups battle for territorial control. Ireland supports the condemnations of these attacks and the calls for the perpetrators to be brought swiftly to justice. <\/p><p>Colombia has made great progress in strengthening peace and stability in recent years, following signature of the Peace Agreement, ending over 50 years of armed conflict. It is clear, however, that significant challenges remain in a number of areas, including rural reform, the reintegration of former combatants, human rights and the strengthening of protections for human rights defenders and social leaders.<\/p><p>I firmly believe that an improved human rights situation in the country is linked to the full implementation of the peace accords. Ireland is a longstanding and committed supporter of the peace process in Colombia, having contributed over &euro;16 million in funding since 2007, mainly channeled through the United Nations, and Colombian and international NGOs focusing on human rights, conflict prevention, peace-building and supporting livelihoods for rural populations.<\/p><p>As well as financial support, Ireland has also provided ongoing support in the form of lesson-sharing based on our own experience of peace-building and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. We also participate in the EU&rsquo;s ongoing campaign to recognise and champion the work of human rights defenders in the country.<\/p><p>I reiterated Ireland's support for the peace process in recent engagements with the Colombian Government, including a meeting with the then-Minister for Foreign Affairs Carlos Holmes Trujillo during his visit to Dublin last year, and in my contacts with his successor, Minister Claudia Blum, earlier this year.<\/p><p>Our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has been engaging with local civil society and EU and UN partners on the human rights situation in the country since it opened last year and advocates for ongoing and increased protection of human rights leaders.

This approach, known as the traffic light system, will bring greater consistency and transparency across the European Union as we fight against the COVID-19 virus. On 20 October, the Government decided on the approach to implementing this system in Ireland. It was decided that:<\/p><p>-  From the morning of 22 October, travellers from green regions can enter the State without being requested to restrict their movements or undergo testing for Covid-19;<\/p><p>-  For now, travellers from orange, red or grey regions will continue to be requested to restrict their movements for 14 days, with the exception of certain exempted categories which will apply from 8 November;<\/p><p>-  It is planned that, also with effect from 8 November, travellers arriving from orange regions will be able to waive the requirement to restrict movements if they have one negative test result up to three days before arrival. The test must be conducted by an authorised entity;<\/p><p>The new approach is now reflected in travel advice published by the Department of Foreign Affairs.

However, once passengers arrive in a State, they are expected to follow the relevant public health measures in place in that State. This means that any person arriving into Ireland must abide by the current public health measures in place. This includes abiding by the current restrictions under Level 5 of the National Framework for Living with COVID-19, where everyone is asked to restrict movements to within 5 km of their home or place of residence unless it is strictly essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300113#WRLL03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Programmes","counter":1752,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300113#WRLL04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1753,"qnumday":661,"qnumall":"[33033\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300113#WRLL04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps Ireland will take to move in line with the priorities outlined in the European Commission 2021 work programme by President Ursula von der Leyen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1754,"content":"<p>In her State of the Union address, delivered on the 16th of September 2020, President von der Leyen presented her vision for a Europe that emerges stronger from the pandemic while playing a key role on the global scene.

From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack.

The availability of documentary evidence and official records also presents a challenge in this case.

This regulation also sets out the criteria for the award of such medals.  It is important that in order to maintain the standing of such medals and indeed all of those provided for in DFR A9, that the criteria outlined is strictly adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of any change to the regulations or to the criteria for the award of DSMs or MMGs is not a straightforward matter and has many associated complexities.  Robust consideration must be given to any potential unintended consequences arising such as maintaining the integrity of the award of medals system and implications for previous decisions of properly constituted medals boards.   The availability of documentary evidence and official records also presents a challenge in this case.  It has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award such medals will be considered. At this juncture, no new information has come to light that would be cause for the matter to be re-examined.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the issue is receiving further consideration. The Chief of Staff is currently considering the matter, in the context of the award of medals, and the possible implications for the integrity of the award of medals system.  The Secretary General of my Department recently met with Comdt Leo Quinlan (retired) on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  A response will issue to Kilkenny County Council and the other local authorities on their motions shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300114#WRMM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1806,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300114#WRMM03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1807,"qnumday":679,"qnumall":"[33084\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300114#WRMM04000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the amount paid annually for the past three years to private airline companies for the movement of Irish military personnel to and from overseas missions; if consideration is being given to the procurement of a national asset to perform this function; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1808,"qnumday":685,"qnumall":"[33097\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300114#WRMM04100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the amount paid annually for the past three years to private airline companies for the movement of Irish military personnel to and from overseas missions; if consideration is being given to the procurement of a national asset to perform this function; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1809,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 679 and 685 together.<\/p><p>My immediate priorities in relation to air-based capability have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and for two Airbus CN 295 maritime patrol aircraft.  No decisions have made for the acquisition of additional aircraft in other roles.  Some &euro;265 million, including VAT, is currently committed to the acquisition of these enhanced capabilities.  <\/p><p>Along with other equipment capability requirements, the acquisition, renewal and retention of equipment capabilities is being pursued under the Defence Forces Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020.  This sets out current priorities and plans taking account of available resources and in line with the policy approach in the White Paper on Defence.  While the option of acquiring a wider military lift capability has been mentioned, it is not identified as an action in the present EDP.Much of this longer range lift capability is provided by way of chartering aircraft through a competitive procurement process on an as-required basis.  To date, this has been considered to be the most cost effective approach taking account of the acquisition, running and maintenance costs of larger aircraft in the context of their expected usage and contingency requirements.  The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability.<\/p><p>The table below provides the amounts paid for the UNDOF and UNIFIL troop rotations for the years 2017-2019.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year <\/b><\/th>       <th><b>Contingent<\/b><\/th>       <th><b>Cost <\/b><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>UNDOF<\/td>       <td><div>&euro;185,350 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>UNIFIL <\/td>       <td><div>&euro;372,470 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>UNDOF <\/td>       <td><div>&euro;224,000 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>UNIFIL <\/td>       <td><div>&euro;388,075 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>UNDOF <\/td>       <td><div>&euro;181,000 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>UNIFIL<\/td>       <td><div>&euro;509,400 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300114#WRMM04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1810,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300114#WRMM04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1811,"qnumday":680,"qnumall":"[33085\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300114#WRMM04400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if cadets that have been deployed again to the front line as contact tracers and contact tracing trainers and have had their their training suspended again will be paid the military service allowance (details supplied).","asker":"1504","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1812,"qnumday":686,"qnumall":"[33098\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300114#WRMM04500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the cadets that have been deployed again to the front line as contact tracers and contact tracing trainers with their own training suspended will be paid the military service allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1813,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 680 and 686 together.<\/p>  <p>The circumstances facing the State with the COVID 19 virus pandemic has placed unprecedented demands on the principal response agencies and the health service in particular.

In 2019, the Department complied with the guidelines with the exception of five contracts (in excess of &euro;25,000) totalling &euro;161,297 (excluding VAT) relating to various services contracts, which were extended beyond their original contract terms.

Air transport for these patients is currently provided in three ways: Air Corps fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft; Irish Coast Guard rotor-wing aircraft; and private air ambulance providers. <\/p>  <p>  As one of the components of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps contributes to all roles assigned by Government including responsibilities relating to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power and maritime security tasks. Like other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps also undertakes other roles in accordance with agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs). <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Defence has an SLA with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and the UK, on an as available basis. In accordance with the SLA, this availability is dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions. The terms of the SLA do not provide for the Air Corps to deliver a dedicated, 24\/7 transport service. This approach was maintained in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which stated that the Air Corps will continue to provide an emergency inter-hospital transfer service in support of the HSE on an as available basis. This means that fixed or rotary wing aircraft are not required to be on standby for this purpose. However, if such aircraft and personnel are available when requested for a mission, they can be deployed. <\/p>  <p>  The level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for non-scheduled inter-hospital transfer tasks has reduced in recent years in respect of night time hours.  As has been acknowledged, recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces are resulting in operational challenges primarily across the Naval Service and Air Corps. A range of actions have been taken to date to address these recruitment and retention issues and further actions are currently being progressed.  These steps are enhancing capacity in the Air Corps with a view to a return to previous levels of capability. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the Air Corps continues to provide support for emergency inter-hospital transfers on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis, having regard to available capabilities and its primary security responsibilities.  To date in 2020, the Air Corps completed a total of 45 inter-hospital missions utilising aircraft from the entire fleet, 31 of which were to the UK, including one priority transfer.  Five-missions were outside of the agreed Service Level Agreement whereby the Air Corps provided the requested air transport of patients to or from mainland Europe.  Over 20% of all emergency inter-hospital support occurred at the weekend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300115#WRNN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations","counter":1833,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300115#WRNN01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1834,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[33721\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300115#WRNN01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the amount due and paid to Ireland from the UN as part of the peacekeeping contract over the past three years; the amounts outstanding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1835,"content":"<p>The United Nations reimburses some personnel and Contingent Owed Equipment costs in respect of contributions to UN led operations.

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisation process.  <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    <\/p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the appeals processes, students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300116#WROO03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":1911,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300116#WROO03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1912,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[32456\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300116#WROO03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when it is planned to move the school completion programme across to her Department; the timeline for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1913,"content":"<p>On 27 June the Taoiseach announced that educational welfare functions and school completion services will be returned to my Department.

The closing date for payment for the 2020\/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Children who apply for transport and who are not eligible under the terms of the scheme are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. <\/p>  <p>  Concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s post primary school education cycle.  Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann determines the allocation of the tickets and refunds payments made on behalf of those concessionary applicants for whom no seats remain. <\/p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed that the child to whom the Deputy refers is not attending her nearest post primary school and is therefore not eligible for school transport under the terms of the scheme. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that payment for school transport for the 2020\/2021 school year was received from the family in question on 9th September 2020 and as such is late.<\/p>  <p>  Late applicants and\/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020\/2021 school year. In addition, payments or submission of medical card details for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route. <\/p>  <p>  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300117#WRPP02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":1949,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300117#WRPP02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1950,"qnumday":725,"qnumall":"[32587\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300117#WRPP02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to a shortfall in numbers of substitution teachers available in the substitution teacher panel to a school (details supplied) in Dublin 9; if additional teachers can be provided to the panel; when additional teachers will be made available; the number of schools that have identified such a shortfall to her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1951,"content":"<p>A number of specific measures have been taken to increase the pool of available substitute teachers, including the establishment, in the 2019\/20 school year, of a Substitute Teacher Supply Panel Scheme on a pilot basis as outlined in Department circular 59\/2019.

Funding for previous segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into schools and overall funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools. A new model for allocating Special Education Teachers in mainstream schools provides a single allocation for special educational supports based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. The model establishes a school&rsquo;s educational profile, which includes traveller children, enrolled in a school under the following strands: <\/p><p>- The number of students with complex special educational needs.<\/p><p>- The social context of school which at primary level, one component includes the number of traveller pupils and at post primary schools, is based on the number of pupils who had exam fee exemptions, including Traveller pupils.<\/p><p>- Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results which includes schools with pupils from the Traveller community who may be attaining lower standardised test scores. <\/p><p>The Department currently spends &euro;1.9b, or over 20% of its total educational budget annually, on making additional provision for children with special educational needs. Schools are provided with additional pupil capitation for Travellers at a current cost of &euro;1.2 million. <\/p><p>In addition, investment of some &euro;125 million is provided by the Department's DEIS Programme for educational inclusion providing for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to Continuing Professional Development and the School Excellence Fund for DEIS.  Traveller pupils are also included for the purposes of determining the level of mainstream teaching staff in the relevant DEIS schools. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Action Plan on Bullying sets out a comprehensive approach to tackling all forms of bullying, including <i>identity based bullying<\/i>, and to promoting positive, inclusive environments in all schools.  Actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including identity based bullying, are addressed.The procedures acknowledge that while bullying can happen to any pupil, it is known that some may be more vulnerable to or at risk of experiencing bullying including Traveller and ROMA children. The Department, in consultation with Traveller representative groups, has commissioned research  on the experiences of  Traveller and ROMA children in schools  and the effectiveness of the Departments anti-bullying procedures.  Three field workers have been recruited from Traveller and ROMA communities to assist with the research.  The final report is expected before the end of this year.<\/p><p>My Department is committed to improving educational outcomes for Traveller and ROMA children through the implementation of the education actions of the National Traveller and ROMA Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS). NTRIS takes a whole of Government approach to improving the lives of Travellers and Roma in Ireland in practical and tangible ways. Departments have worked together to identify actions that can be taken to bring about a real improvement in the quality of life for Travellers and Roma. It also aims to improve public service engagement with Traveller and Roma communities. <\/p><p>The most significant issue for Traveller and Roma children in the education system is that of school attendance, retention and participation. Responding to specific actions in the NTRIS and the DEIS Plan, a Two Year Pilot Programme to target attendance, participation and retention\/school completion has been established in four specific Traveller and ROMA Communities (Ballymun\/Finglas\/Coolock; Tuam, Co. Galway; Enniscorthy\/Bunclody, Wexford and Cork City) . Partners in the project along with this Department include Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration and Traveller and ROMA representatives.

In the 2020\/21 school year there are 887 schools in the DEIS Programme serving in excess of 185,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population.  The rationale for allocating resources and supports based on a schools&rsquo; level of concentrated disadvantage is based on the existence of a &lsquo;multiplier effect&rsquo;, whereby students attending a school with a high concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer academic outcomes, even taking account of individual social background. The approach is grounded in international evidence and it is considered that it is the combination of the various interventions under DEIS that have enabled it to succeed.  <\/p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan acknowledges that over their lifetime children may experience many transitions as they progress along their education journey. In DEIS schools, strong transfer programmes and targeted engagement with parents from groups with a traditionally low level of engagement with education are key to achieving successful transitions. DEIS supports such as the Home School Community Liaison scheme and the School Completion Programme assist students and their families as they transition between settings on their educational pathway.<\/p>  <p>  Well-being supports are provided by my Department throughout the school support structure &ndash; the Continuum of Support. This support structure allows all schools to provide universal support for all students, using preventative, early intervention and strong universal approaches to support well-being and encourage successful transitions.  The Continuum of Support framework also recognises that some students - those groups who are at risk or who have emerging needs - will require more targeted support,  while others who have complex and enduring needs will require an individualised approach to support, taking a developmental perspective, and adapted to the individual needs of the student.<\/p>  <p>  The Education Passport, as developed by the NCCA, also assists schools in the provision of information on pupils as they transition from primary to post primary including any additional needs they may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300117#WRPP05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":1980,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300117#WRPP05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1981,"qnumday":736,"qnumall":"[32703\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300117#WRPP05300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a student (details supplied) can request another appeal of their leaving certificate results after their first appeal was rejected; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1982,"content":"<p>The 2020 Leaving Certificate Calculated Grades appeals process has concluded and the appeal outcomes were made available to students at 12 p.m. on Friday 16 October through the Calculated Grades Student Portal.<\/p>  <p>  In the processing of the appeals, a total of 33,301 individual subject records belonging to 12,216 students were reviewed.

It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020\/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure.

The process, which involves the live transfer of existing schools, is designed to provide additional multi-denominational schools in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community. The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration Process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process envisaged as part of the Schools Reconfiguration process) to engage with their school patron on the matter. A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  <\/p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>Schools have been notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2020\/21.  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The Employment Equality Acts also requires employers to take reasonable steps to accommodate the needs of employees and prospective employees with disabilities. <\/p><p>In order to discharge these statutory management responsibilities effectively and efficiently, it is essential that employers have access to professional occupational health advice on medical fitness for work. The Occupational Health Service (OHS) is in place to assist employers in carrying out this duty in respect of teachers, special needs assistants (SNA)s and also clerical officers\/caretakers employed under the 1978\/79 Scheme.  The OHS provider, contracted by the Department, is the sole recognised provider of independent medical advice for these employees and their employers. It is a requirement of the Sick Leave Scheme that all employers and employees abide by the OHS medical assessment.<\/p><p>The OHS provides services that include pre-employment medical assessments, medical assessments of fitness for work, sickness absence management and ill health retirement assessments. Paragraph 3.3 of the Sick Leave Scheme (Chapter 1) for teachers contained in my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 54\/2019 and also paragraph 3.3 in Circular Letter 60\/2019 for SNAs details the basis for an employer referral to the OHS for an independent medical assessment.  This includes an employer who is obliged to make a discretionary referral to the OHS for an independent medical assessment where reasonable concerns exist as to the capacity of the employee to undertake his\/her duties in a manner that is safe, such as repeated short-term Sick Leave absences, concerns regarding performance of duties as a result of health factors, work-related factors that may be adversely affecting an employee&rsquo;s health or alcohol\/drug related problems. The Employers Procedures Manual contained at Appendix A of these Circulars includes the step by step process for referral of an employee to the OHS for an independent medical assessment.<\/p><p>Paragraph 12.3 of the Sick Leave Scheme for teachers and paragraph 13.3 of the Sick Leave Scheme for SNAs states the following:-<\/p><p><i>&lsquo;Confirmation of fitness must also be obtained by the employer from the OHS, prior to resumption of duties, in the case of a teacher\/SNA who is (i) absent on paid Sick Leave for 4 or more continuous weeks (or a shorter period where the employer has reasonable grounds for concern), or (ii) absent for any period of TRR\/unpaid Sick Leave.&rsquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Based on the terms and conditions of the Sick Leave Scheme, where an employer has reasonable concerns about an employee resuming duties, the OHS advice should be sought prior to a return to the workplace.  The OHS Occupational Physicians offer a unique perspective, insight and skill set that allows them to provide an appropriate assessment and informed opinion with respect to an employee&rsquo;s medical fitness for work, as distinct from an opinion on the nature and severity of their medical complaint. <\/p><p>Where there is a difference of medical opinion between the OHS and the treating Doctor\/Consultant on an employee&rsquo;s medical fitness for work, the OHS will consult with the treating Doctor\/Consultant before providing final advice to the employer. If there is a specific need for an independent medical assessment, this can be facilitated through the OHS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300121#WRTT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":2166,"qnumday":802,"qnumall":"[33402\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300121#WRTT02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if ETBs can impose different conditions of work on teachers who teach students in mainstream post-primary classes as against colleagues on the same contact of employment who teach students pursuing further education courses in relation, for instance, to availability of online teaching and staggered lessons; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":2167,"content":"<p>My Department published the Roadmap for the full return to school on 26<sup>th<\/sup>July 2020 (updated on 5<sup>th<\/sup>August 2020) for the Primary and Post Primary sectors.

The Contract Award Notice was published on 30th July 2020. The majority of suppliers offered alcohol-based products and three among them specialised in alcohol-free products. <\/p><p>As part of the selection process suppliers were required to confirm that their products were compliant with the biocidal and PPE regulations and provide documentation, information on their current live product range and examples of contracts in the last two years which included supply to the Irish public sector. The suppliers in questions fulfilled these requirements. <\/p><p>The procurement process was designed to assist schools by providing them with a list of approved suppliers.  Guidance for schools in relation to Hand Hygiene (including the use of hand sanitiser) was set out in the COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of Primary and Special Schools and COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of Post Primary Schools. Copies of the guidance are provided with this reply.<\/p><p>On 22 October 2020 the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine notified my Department that it had removed ViraPro hand sanitiser from the product register. On the same day my Department removed the supplier of Virapro and its entire product offering from the procurement agreement and advised all schools to cease all use of these products. These products have been on general sale and not just available through the education sector framework.<\/p><p>On Friday 23<sup>rd<\/sup>the Department of Agriculture advised not to use any Virapro branded product and this was communicated to schools.<\/p><p>My Department immediately commenced a review of biocidal products included in the Education Sector PPE procurement agreement.  The review has been undertaken in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which is the regulator in Ireland for biocidal products. <\/p><p>This involved reviewing 172 items from 14 suppliers.  The outcome of this review was a decision to take 43 biocidal and 9 other products off the approved list for schools because it has not been possible to satisfactorily confirm their registration status as part of this review. These products will not be included in my Department&rsquo;s approved list for schools until their registration status has been confirmed. The Department has no evidence that these products are unsafe.<\/p><p>Immediately following the product review my Department on Thursday 29 October, 2020 wrote to all schools to advise them of changes to the approved list of products on the Education Sector PPE procurement agreement, and the steps they can take to procure new stock if they need to. Suppliers on the agreement committed to swift processing of orders and delivery to support schools.  <\/p><p>The Department has added a new supplier to the PPE Agreement, who has confirmed possession of the required biocidal registrations, and 23 new products to the agreement.<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and the Education Procurement Service are engaging directly with the suppliers concerned regarding the status of these products and it may be possible to reinstate these products to the agreement at a later date. <\/p><p>In the case of the ViraPro product I understand that the supplier has supplied approximately 10% of schools.  My Department has estimated that the total value of the product supplied is approximately &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000. <\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is engaging with the supplier in relation to the recall.<\/p><p>Arrangements are in place to ensure that schools impacted will be provided with funding to source new supplies, and to provide for the cost of Aide.

People with a disability may, on a voluntary basis, seek an appointment with an employment supports case officer to discuss their employment ambitions and develop a personal progression plan. Supports  include assistance and advice on employment, training and personal development opportunities from a dedicated Case Officer, a focused service, based on individual needs to support a jobseeker to enter or re-enter the workforce and an access to job vacancies via the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s national www.jobsireland.ie website<\/p><p>EmployAbility is a specialist service (delivered under a contract arrangement with 24 companies in 31 locations around the country on behalf of the Department) which works with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo and Local Employment Services.  EmployAbility participants are people with a disability who are able to work a minimum of 8 hours per week and who need the support of a job coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.  Budget 2021 included a measure to introduce a training support grant for Jobseekers availing of  Employability services.  The grant will seek to fund quick access to short term training or other supports for jobseekers with disabilities.  The grant will be up to &euro;1,000 and will be available in Q1 2021.<\/p><p>The Department contracts for the provision of Local Employment Services (LES) with 22 companies in 26 locations.  Providers deliver a case managed employment service for all Jobseekers (including those with disabilities) who avail of the services. Jobseekers work with a LES Mediator to develop a personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.  Jobseekers either engage directly with LES providers or are referred by my Department for employment service supports.

The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are subject to limitation criteria. <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned  was to complete his time on CE on 13\/11\/2020.  However, due to Level 5 restrictions his contract has been extended and he will now finish up on 4\/12\/2020. <\/p>  <p>  During his time on CE  he  has completed a number of courses including Safe Pass, Sports Surface maintenance, Manual Handling and a number of Horticulture related courses.  The purpose of the training and support that he received while on CE was to prepare him for full-time sustainable employment.<\/p>  <p>  On finishing CE the person concerned may avail of my Department's Activation service who will work with him  to ensure that the benefits of the experience and training he received during his time on CE are maximised.  A case officer will assess his skills, experience, challenges and work goals and assist him in finding full-time sustainable employment.  This process will also help identify potential employment opportunities and offers support to Jobseeker&rsquo;s  in overcoming any barriers to employment<\/p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  Places on these work programmes will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme.  <\/p>  <p>  While I understand that sponsoring bodies may wish to extend a CE participant's time on a CE scheme or CE participants themselves may wish to extend their time on a CE scheme, the Deputy will appreciate that such extensions would have a detrimental effect on other long-term unemployed candidates wishing to avail of the opportunities afforded by CE.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300123#WRVV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Social Scheme","counter":2258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300123#WRVV02200"},{"type":"question","counter":2259,"qnumday":835,"qnumall":"[32335\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300123#WRVV02300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if there is a reduction in funding to the RSS scheme in the proposed Estimates for 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2260,"content":"<p>The 2021 Budget Estimate for the Rural Social Scheme is &euro;52.2m.

This Government acknowledges the important role that carers play and is fully committed to supporting them in that role. Officials in my Department will be examining the policy options for reforming the state pension system both in this area and, more generally, in relation to considerations around a Total Contributions Approach.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.  As a consequence, the Programme for Government commits to establishing a Commission on Pensions to examine a range of issues including sustainability, eligibility, contributions and calculation methods.  The Terms of Reference for this Commission and options for its membership are currently being finalised for consideration by Government. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the current situation is that through the award of credited contributions, normally known as credits, the social insurance system gives significant recognition to time spent caring in terms of qualifying for the State Pension (Contributory).  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.  Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the Homemaker scheme.  The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the State Pension (Contributory) rate of payment when the rate of pension is calculated using the Yearly Average method. <\/p>  <p>  When the Interim Total Contributions Approach (also known as T12) was introduced in 2018, it included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme which fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.  It acknowledged, for the first time, home caring periods prior to 1994 and provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits \/ homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.

They applied for State pension (contributory) on 10 November 2011.  For persons who reach pension age on or after 6 April 2012, social welfare legislation stipulates that a minimum of 520 full-rate paid contributions are required to qualify for State pension (contributory).  Credits cannot be used to satisfy this condition. 520 full-rate contributions equate to 10 years of full-rate insurable employment.<\/p>  <p>  The person&rsquo;s social insurance record has been fully investigated.  According to the records of my Department, they have 458 paid full-rate social insurance contributions.  Their self-employment contributions were paid after the person reached 66 and therefore under social welfare legislation are not reckonable for pension purposes.  A Social Welfare Inspector did not find proof of employment in 1963 to recommend the award of contributions for any part of that year.  Since the person&rsquo;s contributions fall short of the required 520 paid full-rate contributions to qualify for State pension (contributory), their claim was disallowed.  <\/p>  <p>  According to the records of my Department, the person concerned was in receipt of Carer's Allowance from 1 November 1990 to 29 July 2002.   Under social welfare legislation, credits shall not be awarded where there is a two-year gap between these credits and the person&rsquo;s last paid full-rate contribution.  Since the person concerned does not have a record of paid contributions from insurable employment prior to 1990, there is no entitlement to credits.  <\/p>  <p>  Where credits are reckonable, they can only be included in calculation of a person&rsquo;s pension entitlement once the minimum requirement of 520 full-rate paid contributions is satisfied.

The event provided those who were considering re-joining the workforce with information on work placements, opportunities to upskill or retrain and offered them the opportunity to take the next step in their careers.  Speakers presented on subjects such as motivation and reaching one's potential while others provided testimonials and personal stories on re-launching their careers.  The event included opportunities to meet and speak with employers, some of whom had Returners Initiatives or \"returnship\" programmes.  The aim of the event was to support potential returners by helping them to consider the opportunities available to them to map their route back to work into roles aligned to their needs, interests and personal potential.  It was one of more than 20 such events convened on the day across the country.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the importance of continuing to access this pool of talent in order to provide employment opportunities and increase labour market participation levels for groups that are currently inactive or underrepresented in the labour force.  We will continue to promote the supports available for workforce returners, be they men or women, including measures that assist people to upskill with a view to returning to work.    <\/p>  <p>  Once the immediate emergency demands of Covid-19 stabilise, my officers will resume work on planning initiatives to support returners. Building on our engagement with employers will be an important element of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300126#WRYY03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance Scheme","counter":2432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300126#WRYY03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2433,"qnumday":894,"qnumall":"[32992\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300126#WRYY03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will consider equalising the income thresholds for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for one and two parent households and introduce tapering for the allowance to provide greater access to support with school costs for working poor households and to reduce poverty traps; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2434,"content":"<p>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the costs of clothing and footwear when children start or return to school each autumn.

EWSS is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll; and it charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid that are eligible for the subsidy payment.<\/p><p>ELC and SAC services registered with Tusla received an exemption from the EWSS turnover requirements. The rate of subsidy the employer will receive per paid eligible employee under EWSS was enhanced on 20 October 2020 in response to nationwide level 5 restrictions. <\/p><p>Under the enhanced rates, ELC and SAC services with EWSS will have approximately 80% of payroll costs covered. This equates to approximately 50% of the usual operating costs of these services &ndash; allowing them to operate sustainably with lower occupancy rates and higher delivery costs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>The Government introduced the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 on 15 September 2020. The plan outlines the medium-term approach to managing risk and supporting society and business through Covid restrictions at each level from 1 to 5.  The plan recognises that education (ELC, SAC and schooling) provides for the holistic development of children and young people and is the foundation for lifelong learning and wellbeing. It is also essential to parents&rsquo; abilities to balance work with family responsibilities especially those in the workforce on whom we rely to deliver essential services. For this reason, keeping ELC and SAC open is a top priority at each level of restrictions.<\/p><p>Under the July stimulus support package, my Department continues to provide all ELC and SAC subsidy schemes at existing capitation and subsidy rates. These include the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) Saver Programme, Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Saver Programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme. <\/p><p>The recent introduction of the Covid-19 Sustainability Support Fund 2020 is in addition to the all-of-Government July Stimulus package for ELC and SAC Services.  The purpose of the grant is to support the sustainability of ELC and SAC services whose viability is still negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic - in circumstances where supplementary support is required in addition to other July Stimulus supports such as the EWSS. <\/p><p>This is the first time that my Department&rsquo;s sustainability funding has been made available to both private for-profit providers and community non-profit providers, subject to eligibility criteria and an assessment of need. The funding is also available to eligible sole traders for whom the EWSS is not applicable because they do not have employees, including ECCE providers<\/p><p>The sustainability grant provides funding to successful applicants to offset losses caused by a decrease in occupancy and\/or an increase in costs. Sustainability will be supported by providing a grant proportionate to the short-term level of loss in 2020. <\/p><p>While it is hoped that the recently-announced enhancements to the EWSS will result in a significant decrease in need for this funding, the Covid-19 sustainability support remains available, where needed.

My Department is responsible for mobilising EU funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) while the Department of Education and Skills is the designated authority in Ireland for policy and operational matters related to the ESF PEIL.  My Department is a beneficiary under that funding programme.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, as part of Ireland's response to the migration crisis in central and southern Europe, the Government established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). Under this programme, the Government committed to accepting up to 4,000 people into the State, primarily through a combination of the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR's Refugee Resettlement Programme.  To date, more than 3,350 people have arrived in the State under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) and it is expected that we will welcome the remaining complement in due course.  <\/p>  <p>  Last December, a second phase of the programme was announced giving a commitment to welcome a further 2,900 refugees between this year and 2023 through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship.  The Government also announced on 01 October that Ireland will welcome up to 50 people in family groups from Greece under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) following displacement from the Moria camp on the island of Lesbos due to the recent fire that destroyed the camp. <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) for resettling refugees requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at the local level, with support from my Department's IRPP team.  Local authorities play a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through a process carried out by an implementing partner with expertise in community integration and relevant supports. <\/p>  <p>  The IRPP team have agreements with Local Authorities on numbers to be allocated to housing provided by the Local Authorities over a defined period.  The IRPP funds a programme whereby the Local Authorities engage the implementing partner organisation to assist with the resettlement operations &ndash; providing advice, guidance, etc. to refugees once they settle in their new homes in the community.  Each family has the support of an assigned resettlement worker to assist with the transition along with the support of a full-time Resettlement Support Worker and an Intercultural Support Worker. The  Local Authorities are paid an agreed grant amount to fund this aspect of the operation.  This is paid from Exchequer funding.  However,a certain amount of that expenditure can be eligible for recoupment from the EU&rsquo;s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300131#WRDDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Childcare Scheme","counter":2667,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300131#WRDDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2668,"qnumday":976,"qnumall":"[33669\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300131#WRDDD01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the date on which persons will be able to make paper-based applications for the new national childcare scheme.","asker":"1489","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2669,"content":"<p>Paper-based applications for the National Childcare Scheme became available on 13<sup>th<\/sup>March 2020.<\/p><p>As of 20<sup>th<\/sup>October, 1,187 paper applications had successfully been completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300131#WRDDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":2670,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300131#WRDDD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2671,"qnumday":977,"qnumall":"[33691\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300131#WRDDD01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the sixth interim report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes will be made available to Deputies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":2672,"qnumday":985,"qnumall":"[33836\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300131#WRDDD01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will publish the sixth interim report of the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":2673,"qnumday":987,"qnumall":"[33859\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300131#WRDDD02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason he has failed to publish to sixth interim report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes; when it will be published, in view of the public comments of his predecessor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2674,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 977, 985 and 987 together.<\/p><p>The Sixth Interim Report from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes was submitted to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in January 2020. <\/p><p>In the report, the Commission sought an extension to the timeframe for completing its work.

This is to assist them in consistently and collaboratively continuing to adapt to meeting the challenges posed by this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  - Practical Guidance for Further and Higher Education for Returning to On-Site Activity in 2020. This guide was prepared on a consultative basis with sector stakeholders and with the assistance of public health expertise.

To ensure that funding is used effectively, the HEA requires implementation plans from consortia and institutions  setting out clear objectives, milestones and deliverables, aligned to their budgets. All consortia and institutions awarded funding in Year 1 of the Fund will be required to submit revised budgets and work packages, based on the level of funding allocated, prior to disbursal of funds. Funding may be removed or redistributed at the discretion of the HEA, where circumstances change or where sufficient progress on projects is not being made in accordance with project plans. The HEA will hold quarterly meetings with consortia and institutions to monitor progress towards results, as set out in the project plans. Written and financial reports on progress will be required biannually and may be subject to external verification. <\/p><p>Funding will be released in a phased way over the three-year operation of the Transformation Fund, based on progress achieved against objectives set out in proposal submissions. The findings and any &lsquo;lessons learned&rsquo; from the ongoing Landscape Review commissioned by the HEA will also inform the ongoing management and implementation of the Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300134#WRGGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2021","counter":2820,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300134#WRGGG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2821,"qnumday":1032,"qnumall":"[33578\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300134#WRGGG01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the location and estimated budget of the higher education building projects envisaged in budget 2021, in tabular form and those approved in previous capital development plans yet to be actioned; the criteria these projects are to be prioritised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":2822,"qnumday":1034,"qnumall":"[33580\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300134#WRGGG01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide a schedule of all significant capital projects in HEA supported institutions in the final business case, implementation or evaluation stages of development in tabular form.","asker":"1616","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2823,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1032 and 1034 together.<\/p><p>The key drivers of capital investment in higher education include:<\/p><p>- Catering for a significantly expanded student body as demographics feed through from post-primary level<\/p><p>- Supporting the ambitions of Project Ireland 2040 with regard to a more balanced population and employment growth across Ireland&rsquo;s regions<\/p><p>- Developing and sustaining the skills and research base necessary to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness<\/p><p>- Supporting modern, innovative and flexible approaches to teaching and learning, including online provision <\/p><p>In addition to the above, the ambitions of the new Programme for Government in relation to emissions reductions mean that upgrade and retrofit of the existing higher education building stock will become an important objective in its own right.<\/p><p>Higher education capital funding is mainly organised on the basis of funding programmes, which have tailored parameters depending on the objectives that they seek to achieve.

The funding is allocated to agencies on the basis of their application and is not made on the basis of gender. <table>    <tr>       <th>B.09<\/th>       <th><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Funding for Services to   Victims of Crime<\/td>       <td>Funding Granted 2019<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Adapt Domestic Abuse Services   (Limerick)<\/td>       <td>&euro;61,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>AdVIC<\/td>       <td>&euro;37,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>AnyMan (formerly Amen)<\/td>       <td>&euro;20,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Aoibhneas<\/td>       <td>&euro;9,300<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ascend<\/td>       <td>&euro;14,090<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Barnardos<\/td>       <td>&euro;38,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Beacon of Light Counselling   Centre<\/td>       <td>&euro;17,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Bray Women's Refuge<\/td>       <td>&euro;15,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CARI<\/td>       <td>&euro;75,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow Women's Aid<\/td>       <td>&euro;23,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare Haven Services<\/td>       <td>&euro;13,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cope Galway Waterside House<\/td>       <td>&euro;6,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Crime Victims Helpline<\/td>       <td>&euro;116,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cuan Saor Women's Refuge Ltd.<\/td>       <td>&euro;23,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dignity4Patients<\/td>       <td>&euro;11,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Domestic Violence Advocacy   Centre (Sligo) (formerly Waves)<\/td>       <td>&euro;11,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Domestic Violence Response   Galway<\/td>       <td>&euro;15,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal Women's Domestic   Violence Service<\/td>       <td>&euro;17,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Drogheda Women's Refuge and   Children's Refuge Centre<\/td>       <td>&euro;11,500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Rape Crisis Centre<\/td>       <td>&euro;25,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dundalk Counselling Service<\/td>       <td>&euro;20,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Esker House Women's Refuge<\/td>       <td>&euro;13,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Federation for Victim   Assistance<\/td>       <td>&euro;70,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Greystones Family Resource   Centre<\/td>       <td>&euro;3,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Hope Trust<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Tourist Assistance   Service<\/td>       <td>&euro;50,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry Women's Refuge and Support   Services (Adapt)<\/td>       <td>&euro;23,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny Women's Refuge Ltd.

I am informed that this system was based on a model recommended by the then Inspector of Prisons, the late Judge Michael Reilly. A copy of this Complaints Policy can be found on the website of the Irish Prison Service.<\/p><p>All prisoners have the right to make a complaint at any time and all complaints are treated with the utmost seriousness. As you will appreciate, complaints vary in nature and seriousness - for example, some may relate to conditions of accommodation, quality of food or access to services while other complaints can be more serious such as allegations of assault, mistreatment or intimidation. <\/p><p>The current system categorises complaints according to their nature and seriousness, ranging from the most serious 'Category A' complaint through to a 'Category F' complaint. <\/p><p>Further information on this system, including these categories, is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service at the following link:  <\/p><p>The most serious &quot;Category A&quot; complaints are those alleging assault or use of excessive force against a prisoner, or ill treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation, threats or any other conduct against a prisoner of a nature and gravity likely to bring discredit on the Irish Prison Service.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search without warrant for knives and offensive weapons. I am advised a substantial number of convictions have been secured in the courts over the past number of years for possession of a knife or other similar article. Sentencing policy is kept under ongoing review by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a reduction in reported crimes against persons in the first two quarters of this year versus last year and according to the Central Statistics Office, in the first quarter the \"assault causing harm\" category fell 23.9% and in the second quarter it fell 16.9% when compared with the same periods in the previous year. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently operating an assault reduction strategy for 2019 to 2021, which is targeted at tackling all types of assaults in public, including use of knives. This strategy is informed by a pro-arrest, early investigation and proactive high-visibility approach. It places particular emphasis on prevention, education and awareness. The strategy promotes early prosecution of offenders where feasible and operationally appropriate. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also addresses knife crime through education and engagement with community initiatives.

I intend to support the passage of the amended bill through the houses of the Oireachtas to help strengthen legislation in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300136#WRJJJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":2923,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300136#WRJJJ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2924,"qnumday":1069,"qnumall":"[33377\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300136#WRJJJ02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the nationality breakdown of all new Irish citizens from 2014 to 2020 to date in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":2925,"qnumday":1070,"qnumall":"[33378\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300136#WRJJJ02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of successful applicants for Irish citizenship waiting to be officially granted citizenship; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2926,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1069 and 1070 together.<\/p><p>As of 27<sup><\/sup>October 2020, there are 2,258 applicants awaiting a ceremony granting citizenship.

Approximately 400 minor certificates recently issued by post with 292 minor certificates to be issued in the coming period.  <\/p><p>COVID-19 has unfortunately prevented the holding of our large-scale citizenship ceremonies, which is impacting the processing of applications. I was pleased to announce on 22 October 2020, that I have approved a solution to replace the ceremonies with a sworn affidavit on an interim basis and the priority drafting of a statutory instrument to implement this change. My Department will issue the naturalisation certificate on receipt of a statutory declaration. This will alleviate the current holdup of applications that have been approved and awaiting a ceremony to swear their allegiance to the Irish State thus enabling these applicants to start their new lives as Irish citizens. It remains my  intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. <\/p><p>The following table sets out the certificates of naturalisation issued between 1 January 2014 and 30 September 2020, by nationality. It includes both adults and minors and covers all application categories.  In total, there were 72,349 certificates issued between these dates. In addition to those listed in the table, there were a further 51 countries where a total of 260 certificates of naturalisation were issued to 10 or fewer of their citizens.

dignity of care and rehabilitation to prisoners for safer communities.  <\/p><p>My Department has taken steps to brings the Irish prison system into line with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (known as &lsquo;Mandela Rules&rsquo;) in respect of solitary confinement. This included Statutory Instrument 276 of 2017 which amended Rule 27 of the Prison Rules 2007 and which provides a statutory entitlement to prisoners for a minimum of two hours out-of-cell time daily. Therefore,  all prisoners have a right, save in exceptional circumstances, to a minimum of 2 hours out of their cell with an opportunity for meaningful human contact.  <\/p><p>The means by which this Statutory Instrument is implemented is contained within the Irish Prison Service Policy on the Elimination of Solitary Confinement, which is publicly available on their website. <\/p><p>This 2017 Statutory Instrument brings the Irish prison system into line with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (known as &lsquo;Mandela Rules&rsquo;) in respect of solitary confinement.<\/p><p>On occasion, it is necessary for vulnerable prisoners and others to be separated from the general prison population. This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his\/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him\/her. In addition, under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007 a Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  In addition a smaller number of prisoners may have their regimes restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).  <\/p><p>The Prison Rules also provide that the imposition of a restricted regime is closely monitored by the Irish Prison Service and the status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed. The Director General of the Irish Prison Service chairs a high level group to examine the measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners held on restricted regimes with a view to ensuring that all receive, as a minimum standard, out of cell time of two hours per day, to engage in exercise or activity.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may appreciate, in light of the COVID - 19 pandemic, a number of measures have been required to be undertaken by the Service in order to protect our prison population. These are taken in line with Public Health advice and have resulted in an increase in the number of prisoners whose regime has been restricted. The Deputy will appreciate that for obvious medical and infection control reasons, those prisoners suspected of infection are placed on a more restrictive form of regime while the testing process is completed.<\/p><p>All prisoners newly committed to prison are placed in quarantine for ten days before being transferred into general population. This measure is in place in order to reduce the risk that a new committal, who might be incubating the virus, could spread Covid-19 into the general prison population. Furthermore, any prisoner who informs staff that they are experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 is immediately assessed by prison healthcare staff who arrange for the prisoner to be isolated and tested. Any prisoner who has had contact with another person who has been tested for Covid-19 and is awaiting results is also isolated from the prison population, while they are tested and awaiting the results of said test.<\/p><p>On 9 April 2020 the Irish Prison Service, in line with Public Health advice, introduced a regime wherein all prisoners over the age of 70, or prisoners with specific serious underlying medical conditions, were cocooned in the prisons in which they were detained.

Access to free third level education for Irish born non-citizen young persons is dependent on having the appropriate permission to remain in the State.

The penalty on conviction is a fine of up to &euro;1,500 for a first offence and up to &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence.<\/p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, makes provision for offences relating to the sale and delivery of alcohol products to persons under the age of 18 years. It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol products to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission. On conviction for a first offence, a mandatory closure order of between two and seven days will be imposed by the court, together with a fine of up to &euro;3,000. The penalties for a second or subsequent offence is a closure order of between 7 and 30 days and a fine of up to &euro;5,000. In addition, the licence holder is required to continue to pay staff for the duration of the closure period.<\/p>  <p>  With technology that facilitates video calls being commonplace in the conduct of business in a broad spectrum of contexts, there do not appear to be any practical impediments to vendors verifying the age of purchasers who purchase alcohol from their homes.  The purchase must be completed from their home in advance of delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 report.  It took the view that sales of alcohol products which have been ordered by telephone or text messaging and which are paid for on delivery do not comply with licensing law requirements and are, therefore, illegal. The Group recommended that the Garda&iacute; target &ldquo;dial-a-can&rdquo; and similar delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the licensing acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, there is substantial existing legislation to regulate the delivery of alcohol services in Ireland and, as matters currently stand, I do not propose to introduce new legislation in this area.  However, I do appreciate that, with the Covid-19 outbreak, habits of consumers have been affected and the share of purchases online has increased substantially. These changes may be temporary or they may be the beginning of longer term trends. It is perhaps too early to tell what impacts these changes may have and whether increased online sales and delivery of alcohol will, on balance, provide increased convenience and choice to consumers and new revenue streams for small rural pubs or have negative impacts on society that require further regulation.  It is in that context that I remain open to reviewing the situation should compelling objective evidence emerge indicating that a further examination of the legislation regulating these matters is warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300137#WRKKK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":2983,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300137#WRKKK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2984,"qnumday":1092,"qnumall":"[33943\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300137#WRKKK03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 7 of 22 October 2020, the way in which persons born here or who are long-term resident here as minors but are not Irish, EEA, UK or Swiss nationals can apply for citizenship; if her attention has been drawn to barriers to them doing so; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2985,"content":"<p>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.<\/p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputies can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. <\/p><p>The Deputies should note, that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo; in the Living with Covid Plan provides for restrictions on gatherings of people indoors given the higher risk associated with these types of activities and sets out when it is considered that religious services can take place with protective measures (Levels 1 and 2) and when they must move online (Levels 3,4 and 5). Weddings and funerals are exceptions and can continue at every level with limited numbers. <\/p><p>Churches and other places of worship can remain open for private prayer. It is also important to note that at all levels, Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.  The relevant regulations relating to Level 5 restrictions are S.I. 448 of 2020 (Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 8) Regulations 2020).<\/p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the Government has sought to implement these measures on the basis of guidance as opposed to regulations wherever possible. It could be noted that holding a religious gathering is not a penal offence. <\/p><p>I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made be people across the country at this difficult time. I know that that includes many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19. Indeed, as the Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach met with the leaders of the Catholic Church last week to consider the range of issues relating this matter.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputies will wish to note that comprehensive guidelines are in place to ensure that religious services can take place safely when<b><\/b>they recommence: <i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300138#WRLLL04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3051,"qnumday":1113,"qnumall":"[33642\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300138#WRLLL05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure blind and vision impaired persons have access to Covid-19 health information in their preferred format, including braille, large print and audio; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3052,"content":"<p>COVID-19 has had a significant impact on every individual, especially those with additional needs.<\/p><p>Considerable efforts have been undertaken by the Department and by the relevant State bodies in putting in place measures to protect vulnerable groups.

It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. <\/p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society.  The Government has decided that Ireland will move to level 5 of the framework. <\/p><p>At Level 5, up to 25 mourners can attend a funeral.

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. <\/p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  <\/p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  <\/p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019\/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact. <\/p>  <p>  The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country. A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in the community. Maximising uptake of LAIV in children will also help protect others against influenza in the community.  The full quantity of LAIV ordered has also now been received and is being distributed to GPs and pharmacists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300140#WRNNN03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Groups","counter":3173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300140#WRNNN03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3174,"qnumday":1152,"qnumall":"[32433\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300140#WRNNN03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the values of the document of a religious order have not been amended or replaced in the constitution for a company (details supplied) which was published after the company registered with the CRO in August 2020, despite a commitment by a person in 2017 that the 2010 code would be amended and replaced in the constitution of the successor company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3175,"qnumday":1153,"qnumall":"[32434\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300140#WRNNN03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the phrase voice for the voiceless which is a common citation for Catholic organisations when referencing abortion which is used in the constitution for a company (details supplied); if he has endeavoured to discuss this with the company with the view to having it removed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3176,"qnumday":1154,"qnumall":"[32435\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300140#WRNNN03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has sought an explicit, public and legally binding guarantee from a company (details supplied) that it will not deny procedures which are legal here based on religious beliefs or the ethical code of the hospitals under its ownership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3177,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1152 to 1154, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I understand that St Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG was incorporated in August 2020.

Financial supports for non-intern student nurses and midwives are governed by Circular 9\/2004, that provides:<\/p><p>- an accommodation allowance up to &euro;50.79 per week to be paid where it is necessary for a student to obtain accommodation away from their normal place of residence.<\/p><p>- a refund of travel expenses.<\/p><p>Both are paid as refunds on production of receipts. <\/p><p>In the immediate term my Department is reviewing the current accommodation and travel allowances that apply to this year&rsquo;s 1<sup>st<\/sup>, 2<sup>nd<\/sup>and 3<sup>rd<\/sup>year students on clinical placements, taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on such placements.<\/p><p>The revision is expected to conclude shortly, and I look forward to bringing forward proposals thereafter.<\/p><p>Concerning 4<sup>th<\/sup>year nursing and midwifery students, the HSE continues to fund the internship employment of these student who are on rostered work placements. It is very important to me that the training element is protected for students. This includes those scheduled to commence in the coming weeks and those due to commence rostered work placement in 2021. These 4<sup>th<\/sup>year student nurses and midwives on rostered work placement are paid at the approved rate, that is &euro;22,229 on an annual basis for psychiatric nursing specialism and &euro;21,749 for all other nursing disciplines. <\/p><p>I am open to examining what other measures that can be put in place to protect and support student nurse and midwife education and welfare at the present time. My priority is to ensure placements continue so long as it is safe to do so. In that regard, my Department is engaging with the HSE and higher education bodies on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>Separately, and for the longer term, my Department is also reviewing the accommodation and travel allowances for students on clinical placements that should apply from the academic year commencing Autumn 2021 and onwards. This review is expected to conclude at the end of this month, and I look forward to examining the outcome of this review in due course.<\/p><p>As the cost of paying students is a service matter, I have referred the matter to the HSE and asked that it respond directly to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300141#WROOO03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":3214,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300141#WROOO04000"},{"type":"question","counter":3215,"qnumday":1167,"qnumall":"[32500\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300141#WROOO04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons from each hospital and relevant centre who have been provided with healthcare worker accommodation since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic; the number of those persons who are currently availing of the accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3216,"content":"<p>Access to temporary accommodation for healthcare workers has been set up by the HSE.

It acknowledges that caf&eacute;s, restaurants and pubs and close-contact personal services, are the world of work for so many in our communities. <\/p><p>Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.  <\/p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. <\/p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, unfortunately, this means closing many businesses and amenities to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread.<\/p><p>Regarding the impact of the closure of these businesses on the overall R number, I have been advised by the Irish Epidemiology Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG), that it is not feasible to provide reliable estimates of the impact of very specific interventions.  In order to do this, a series of assumptions would need to be made in relation to the number of close contacts that occur in a setting, the number of close contacts that occur in the population as a whole, the relative risk that such close contacts lead to infection, and the effect of mitigating measures such as the use of PPE. Small changes in these assumptions lead to very different outcomes in terms of impact upon the R number.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>For your information, technical notes on the approaches used to estimate effective reproduction number (Re) or time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) are published on the Department of Health website   <i><\/i><\/p><p>Further information on all levels of <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19<\/i>is available at: .  <i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300142#WRPPP05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Audiology Services","counter":3278,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300142#WRPPP05600"},{"type":"question","counter":3279,"qnumday":1187,"qnumall":"[32561\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300142#WRPPP05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that audiology services are minimally disrupted in view of the latest Covid-19 restrictions in view of the urgency of the appointments for patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3280,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300142#WRPPP05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":3282,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300143#WRQQQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3283,"qnumday":1188,"qnumall":"[32575\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300143#WRQQQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of taxi services for the disability sector at present, particularly in circumstances in which persons were collected from their home before the pandemic.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3284,"content":"<p>The HSE has no statutory obligation to provide transport services and funding is not provided. However, some transport supports are provided by the HSE or funded agencies on a discretionary basis. A variety of transport solutions are pursued in each CHO area, including: <\/p>  <p>  - Travel training by service providers or families to enable public transport to be used upon commencement of their day programme where applicable.<\/p>  <p>  - Service providers provide transport where available capacity exists.<\/p>  <p>  - Local transport e.g. Local Link, private bus transport providers and taxis, funded via a combination of service provider, HSE funding, service user contribution, and \/ or combined funding to meet the transport requirements identified.<\/p>  <p>  - HSE local funding, where available, is utilised to support service providers to provide transport solutions for service users.<\/p>  <p>  - Families agree to transport service users to service providers.<\/p>  <p>  In general, disability service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE was successful in securing Dormant Account monies to fund a project to map all Disability transport routes nationally, via information gathering by Disability Service providers and HSE Services who provide transport. The outputs of this study will be used as a basis for considering how to improve access to disability services and how to best make use of local resources.  <\/p>  <p>  The availability of safe transport is essential to the delivery of Day Services across the country. Reduced capacity on vehicles will mean more journeys to facilitate those that require a transport service to access their day service location. <\/p>  <p>  As services resume it will be necessary to identify how transport can continue to be provided in as safe a manner as possible and strictly within social distancing and other COVID-19 precautions. Transport providers will have to demonstrate that their transport services are safe and that all COVID-19 precautions have been established and observed. The guidance includes general guidelines and a risk assessment matrix on safe transport. While family members are to be encouraged to transport the individual to Day Services, this will not always be possible depending on the family circumstances and in these cases, there will continue to be a reliance on bus transport.<\/p>  <p>  Transport is a theme of the National Disability Inclusion strategy, and Action 104 of this strategy states: 'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision.

These amendments, which are the result of a review that began in 2019, better relate to requirements for day to day practice while ensuring that the appropriate standard of English language is still maintained.

The revised guidance followed a substantial review process. <\/p>  <p>  This guidance aligns with the 5 level framework of restrictive measures as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support in the safe visiting, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living.<\/p>  <p>  The new guidance provides a clear and open framework for visiting. It provides guidance on the measures required to be adopted by nursing homes and by visitors to mitigate risks associated with visiting. It also re-emphasises that in circumstances where visiting may need to be restricted or suspended in nursing homes for the protection of residents and staff, alternative arrangements such as &ldquo;window visiting&rdquo; is acceptable across all 5 levels of the framework of restrictive measures, providing a nursing home can safely facilitate them, and that arrangements should be in place to support virtual visiting (telephone or video-link) to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that each individual nursing home provider has legal responsibilities under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 with regard to facilitating visits. A provider may determine that restrictions may be required if in their opinion visits would pose a risk to residents. It is therefore a matter for each provider to consider the arrangements they have in place in relation to visiting. The HPSC&rsquo;s guidance has been developed to assist providers in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously publicly stated, I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice. While many nursing homes have shown great, innovative practice throughout the pandemic, I continue to urge all nursing homes to have plans in place for innovative, safe alternative visiting and communication arrangements for residents and their families and friends, during periods of enhanced protective measures. The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be understated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. <\/p>  <p>  On 22 September I wrote to all nursing home providers with regard to the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s recommendations, with a particular focus on communication, both in terms of the ongoing situation and visiting protocols. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have also written separately to the national representative body for nursing homes, encouraging providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  These measures are in place to safeguard the health of residents in these facilities, and also the health of those staff that provide care and support to residents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300146#WRTTT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":3466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300146#WRTTT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":3467,"qnumday":1257,"qnumall":"[32806\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300146#WRTTT04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a shortage of flu vaccines; and his plans to obtain a supply of same in order for persons that need to and or want to avail of the vaccine this winter season","asker":"1489","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3468,"content":"<p>The Government has expanded the provision of seasonal influenza vaccination without charge to all of those in the HSE-defined at-risk groups, including healthcare workers, and to all children aged from 2 to 12 years.

The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  <\/p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  <\/p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended.

This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019\/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact.  <\/p>  <p>The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country. A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in the community. Maximising uptake of LAIV in children will also help protect others against influenza in the community.  The full quantity of LAIV ordered has also now been received and is being distributed to GPs and pharmacists.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300146#WRTTT04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3469,"content":"<p>Question No. 1258 answered with Question No. 1166.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":3470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300146#WRTTT04500"},{"type":"question","counter":3471,"qnumday":1259,"qnumall":"[32820\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300146#WRTTT04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which the travel abroad statistic is arrived at; if he will provide the statistics on this since records started to be collected (details supplied); the instances in which this statistic was retrospectively amended; and the reason for doing so in each instance","asker":"1489","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3472,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300146#WRTTT04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":3474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300147#WRUUU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3475,"qnumday":1260,"qnumall":"[32823\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300147#WRUUU00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if additional resources will be considered for approval for the rheumatology department in University Hospital Kerry (details supplied) to address the care issues resulting in acute anxiety and distress due to the lack of adequate resources.","asker":"1488","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3476,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300147#WRUUU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":3477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300147#WRUUU00500"},{"type":"question","counter":3478,"qnumday":1261,"qnumall":"[32824\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300147#WRUUU00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the next HSE capital plan will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3479,"content":"<p>The Health capital allocation in 2021 is now &euro;1,035m (incl. e-Health and ICT) as notified in the context of Budget 2021.

It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation . The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus.

The revised guidance followed a substantial review process. <\/p>  <p>  This guidance aligns with the 5 level framework of restrictive measures as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support in the safe visiting, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living.<\/p>  <p>  The new guidance provides a clear and open framework for visiting. It provides guidance on the measures required to be adopted by nursing homes and by visitors to mitigate risks associated with visiting. In circumstances where the level of the virus circulating in the community is high, there is greater risk to nursing homes and other vulnerable settings and people. It is of great concern that heightened community transmission will bring further unwitting transmission of COVID-19 into nursing homes impacting on those most vulnerable to the virus.  In response to the overarching situation, the Government took the decision to move the whole country to level 5 of the Framework of Restrictive measures from 21st October. This was a significant decision. The purpose of these measures is to respond to the current situation, break the chains of transmission and reduce the amount of the virus circulating in the community. With regard to visits to nursing homes, the public health advice in relation to Level 5 is clear &ndash; that visits should be suspended aside from critical and compassionate circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The advice also re-emphasises that in circumstances where visiting may need to be restricted or suspended in nursing homes for the protection of residents and staff, alternative arrangements such as &ldquo;window visiting&rdquo; is acceptable across all 5 levels of the framework of restrictive measures, providing a nursing home can safely facilitate them, and that arrangements should be in place to support virtual visiting (telephone or video-link) to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously publicly stated, I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice. While many nursing homes have shown great, innovative practice throughout the pandemic, I continue to urge all nursing homes to have plans in place for innovative, safe alternative visiting and communication arrangements for residents and their families and friends, during periods of enhanced protective measures. The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be understated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. <\/p>  <p>  On 22 September I wrote to all nursing home providers  with regard to the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s recommendations, with a particular focus on communication, both in terms of the ongoing situation and visiting protocols. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have also written separately to the national representative body for nursing homes, encouraging providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  These measures are in place to safeguard the health of residents in these facilities, and also the health of those staff that provide care and support to residents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300148#WRVVV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":3534,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300148#WRVVV01300"},{"type":"question","counter":3535,"qnumday":1283,"qnumall":"[32919\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300148#WRVVV01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if agency staff working for a State agency (details supplied) have been provided with the same level of Covid-19 protections as permanent staff, including the option to work from home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3536,"content":"<p>I would like to advise the Deputy that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has prepared and circulated a Guidance document for public service employers and employees in relation to HR matters during Covid.

To this end, a Dialogue Forum with Voluntary Organisations was established in December 2019 as recommended in the Report as a key mechanism for strengthening this relationship. The aim of the Forum is to build a stronger working relationship between the State and the voluntary healthcare sector for the benefit of patients and service users. The Forum will also facilitate regular dialogue with the voluntary sector on Sl&aacute;intecare and other policy initiatives and will consider issues around governance more generally.<\/p>  <p>  The Forum is independently chaired by Peter Cassells. Members of the Forum include the Department, the HSE, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission and the main representative bodies of voluntary providers of health and social care: The Wheel; Mental Health Reform; Disability Federation of Ireland; Not for Profit Association; National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers; Voluntary Healthcare Forum; Voluntary Hospices Group and National Community Care Network. <\/p>  <p>  The Forum met twice in December and January, but further meetings scheduled for March 2020 and May 2020 were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The Chair recently convened a sub-group of the Forum to act as a planning group to assist him in planning and, where appropriate, progressing the work of the Forum over the next three to four months.

The agreement recognised that some of the remaining Section 39 organisations were also likely to have pay restoration issues and a process to address these issues commenced in 2019 under the auspices of the WRC. Despite the engagement which took place, it has not yet been possible to reach agreement.  This is because management cannot provide a timeframe or a commitment to fund this part of the process. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE are currently costing this next phase of pay restoration and are expected to complete the exercise in the coming weeks.

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. <\/p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.   <\/p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is approximately double the amount administered last season.  The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter.  This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up.  In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  <\/p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended.  However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received.  950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019\/20 season.  The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution.  The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks.  Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. <\/p>  <p>  The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country.  A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in the community.  Maximising uptake of LAIV in children will also help protect others against influenza in the community.  The full quantity of LAIV ordered has also now been received and is being distributed to GPs and pharmacists.<\/p>  <p>  Given the importance of increasing the level of uptake of the flu vaccine this year, GPs and pharmacists are incentivised not only to deliver vaccination to the expanded groups, but to actively seek out relevant patients and deliver vaccinations in a programmatic way, such as through dedicated flu vaccination clinics.  In addition to the fee of &euro;15 for administering the vaccine to those in the at-risk group and &euro;20 for the administration of the nasal vaccine to children, GPs and pharmacists will be eligible for an additional payment of &euro;100 for every 10 patients in the at-risk categories vaccinated and &euro;150 for every 10 children to whom the LAIV is administered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300151#WRYYY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Substance Misuse","counter":3680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300151#WRYYY01200"},{"type":"question","counter":3681,"qnumday":1336,"qnumall":"[33212\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300151#WRYYY01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the emergency funding to offset the costs of delivering drug and alcohol services in the context of Covid-19, which was announced during the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann debate on the National Drugs Strategy on 10 September 2020 will be made available to drug and alcohol task force and to community drug projects; the level of emergency funding being made available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3682,"content":"<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has created a time of uncertainty and anxiety for everyone and particularly for those who are affected by drug and alcohol addiction.

This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  <\/p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  <\/p>  <p>  Half of the total doses of LAIV (nasal) vaccination for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 years has been distributed to GPs and pharmacists.

It is therefore a matter for each provider to consider the risks and mitigation measures associated with their service. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  <\/p><p>On the 1 October the Health Protection Surveillance Centre&rsquo;s (HPSC) new COVID-19 Guidance on visitations to Long Term Residential Care Facilities was published. The revised guidance followed a substantial review process. <\/p><p>This guidance aligns with the 5 level framework of restrictive measures as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support in the safe visiting, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living.<\/p><p>The new guidance provides a clear and open framework for visiting. It provides guidance on the measures required to be adopted by nursing homes and by visitors to mitigate risks associated with visiting. It also re-emphasises that in circumstances where visiting may need to be restricted or suspended in nursing homes for the protection of residents and staff, alternative arrangements such as &ldquo;window visiting&rdquo; is acceptable across all 5 levels of the framework of restrictive measures, providing a nursing home can safely facilitate them, and that arrangements should be in place to support virtual visiting (telephone or video-link) to the greatest extent possible.<\/p><p>As I have previously publicly stated, I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice. While many nursing homes have shown great, innovative practice throughout the pandemic, I continue to urge all nursing homes to have plans in place for innovative, safe alternative visiting and communication arrangements for residents and their families and friends, during periods of enhanced protective measures. The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be understated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. <\/p><p>On 22 September I wrote to all nursing home providers with regard to the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s recommendations, with a particular focus on communication, both in terms of the ongoing situation and visiting protocols. <\/p><p>Officials in my Department have also written separately to the national representative body for nursing homes, encouraging providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and well-being.  These measures are in place to safeguard the health of residents in these facilities, and also the health of those staff that provide care and support to residents.<\/p><p>Current guidance and the recommendations of the Expert Panel report seek to enhance standardisation and consistency in service delivery, including in areas such as visiting and communication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3774,"content":"<p>Question No. 1369 answered with Question No. 1166.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parking Charges","counter":3775,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA00600"},{"type":"question","counter":3776,"qnumday":1370,"qnumall":"[33418\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if consideration has been given to waiving parking fees for front-line staff in hospitals in view of the level 5 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3777,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Access","counter":3778,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA00900"},{"type":"question","counter":3779,"qnumday":1371,"qnumall":"[33427\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures in place and being considered to ensure that arthritis sufferers can access rheumatology services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, appointments and treatments during level 5 restrictions and beyond; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3780,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to examine the issues raised and to respond to the Deputy as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3781,"content":"<p>Question No. 1372 answered with Question No. 1186.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":3782,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA01300"},{"type":"question","counter":3783,"qnumday":1373,"qnumall":"[26404\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300153#WRAAAA01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding will be allocated to the relevant Department as part of budget 2021 to support those receiving home help and other vital services in the home during Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3784,"content":"<p>Budget 2021 provides for the continuation of the extraordinary public health measures and health and social care service supports introduced in 2020, measures that are essential to protect health care workers, vulnerable groups and the wider public from the worst impacts of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  A home first approach is being taken founded on a community model of care that puts in place end to end care pathways to deliver care to people at or near home.

The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.<\/p><p>This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. <\/p><p>A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020\/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. <\/p><p>With regard to critical care beds, at the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. <\/p><p>Where necessary, the number of critical care beds can surge beyond the baseline of 280-285 as part of an emergency response. However, it is essential to understand that the use of surge capacity for critical care is necessarily tied to a reduction of services in other areas of the hospital. Moreover, the clinical advice is clear that the greater the reliance on surge ICU capacity, the greater the clinical risk with potential impact on patient outcomes.<\/p><p>Our critical care units have coped well so far, largely due to the fact that the curve was flattened successfully in early stages. As a result, our outcomes for Covid patients in ICU have compared well with other jurisdictions including the UK.<\/p><p>Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In relation to community capacity, a home first approach is being taken founded on a community model of care that puts in place end to end care pathways to deliver care to people at or near home. This will include an integrated a mix of services delivered through Community Health Networks working closely with integrated older person teams, frailty teams, utilisation of new rehabilitation beds and enhanced home care with a new 5 million hours for 2021.  The intermediate care beds are intended to enable people to avoid going into acute hospitals or when admitted to acute hospitals to enable to go home more quickly following a period of rehabilitation. These repurposed and additional beds will be located within the 9 Community Healthcare Organisations. <\/p><p>This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. <\/p><p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300154#WRBBBB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":3826,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300154#WRBBBB01000"},{"type":"question","counter":3827,"qnumday":1390,"qnumall":"[33590\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300154#WRBBBB01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if maternity visitation restrictions can be eased to make room for social bubble, social and household exclusive support network; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3828,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300154#WRBBBB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3830,"qnumday":1391,"qnumall":"[33603\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300154#WRBBBB01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a full list of regulations to allow for fines for the breaking of Covid-19 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3831,"content":"<p>My Department is working closely with the Department of Justice to draft and finalise regulations around the introduction of fixed penalty notices.

An important element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree, with the private hospitals on a new arrangement  which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases and separately with ongoing agreed access, in conjunction with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to private hospital services to address the HSE's priority needs in providing both urgent time-critical care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays. <\/p>  <p>  In August the HSE initiated a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address anticipated shortfalls over the next two years.

In some cases, services are delivered directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE). However the majority of organisations providing services for people with a disability are funded by the HSE, on a contract for services basis, underpinned by Section 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004. Service Level Agreements are set out between the HSE and the individual organisations. Section 38 and Section 39 disability service providers have independent boards, who govern the organisations concerned and any deficits accruing are the responsibility of these organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years. Budget 2021 provides for an unprecedented level of investment in disability services, with an investment of &euro;100m for new initiatives in 2021.

Criteria for dispersing this funding is being finalised.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of COVID-19, the HSE has provided significant supports to Section 38 and Section 39 organisations providing disability specialist services. Through the Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs), the HSE is actively engaging with any Section 38 and Section 39 disability service providers who are experiencing financial challenges, including access to cash acceleration, where appropriate, to maintain continuity of service provision where cash flow issues arise.  Organisations receiving funding from the HSE should raise any concerns in relation to financial issues that may have implications for continuity of service provision with the relevant Community Health Care Organisation (CHO) responsible for the service arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has agreed to allocate substantial additional funding to the Health Vote to meet the costs associated with the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Action Plan in response to COVID-19.

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, families, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus.<\/p><p>Measures such as those introduced at level 5 are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect what we know are our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.  The Government is committed to ensuring a balanced and proportionate response to COVID-19 in finding ways to implement public health measures in response to the pandemic in a way that is fair, reasonable and proportionate. <\/p><p>Since the beginning of this crisis, the Government has developed a greater understanding the transmission of COVID-19, gained insight into the people that it poses the greatest risk to, developed testing and tracing protocols, and become part of a worldwide effort to generate vaccines and drug therapies to counter the virus. <\/p><p>We know that COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. We also know that COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  <\/p><p>Therefore the most important way to stop the spread of Covid-19 is for everyone to adhere to the current public health measures, such as good hand hygiene, physical distancing, cough and sneeze etiquette, wearing a face covering, avoiding crowded situations, and not attending work when symptoms appear.  <\/p><p>Throughout the course of the pandemic, testing and contact tracing has been and continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response. The development of a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation has been central to our public health strategy for containing and slowing the spread of COVID-19 since the outset.  <\/p><p>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is another key part of the response,  and the health service responded quickly to a worldwide shortage and developed guaranteed supply lines to ensure adequate PPE was available throughout 2020, along with ensuring the stock levels were increased for the future.<\/p><p>As new scientific evidence becomes available, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE continues to publish and update guidance documents for managing potential cases of COVID-19 in both healthcare and non-healthcare settings, which are available at the following link:<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As I am sure you can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the decisions necessary to protect everybody living in Ireland from its effects is constantly evolving.

Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty. Waiting list data collated by the NTPF is one indicator of the level of demand for hospital services, including ophthalmology appointments and cataract procedures. The NTPF have advised my Department that at the end of September there were 5,013 patients waiting for a cataract procedure across more than 10 central sites. The attached spreadsheet provides detailed information on the sites that currently hold a cataract waiting list, as well as the number of patients waiting for the procedure by time-band. <\/p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2017, with the number of patients awaiting a procedure down 68% since July 2017. At the end of September 2020 there were 1,380 patients waiting over 9 months compared to July 2017, when there were 4,371 waiting over 9 months.<\/p><p>My Department continues to work with the HSE and NTPF to monitor waiting times for scheduled care and identify areas where access to services can be improved. In this context it is important to recognise that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic this year. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer most routine scheduled care activity in March, April, and May of this year. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and urgent time-critical work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. <\/p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.<\/p><p>Cataract Waiters by Hospital <table>    <tr>       <th>Sum of Amount<\/th>       <th>Column Labels<\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Row Labels<\/td>       <td>0-9 Months<\/td>       <td>9-15 Months<\/td>       <td>15-18 Months<\/td>       <td>18+ Months<\/td>       <td>Grand Total<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway University Hospitals<\/td>       <td>472<\/td>       <td>76<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>548<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Letterkenny University Hospital<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>27<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mater Misericordiae University Hospital<\/td>       <td>1118<\/td>       <td>231<\/td>       <td>24<\/td>       <td>30<\/td>       <td>1403<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Nenagh Hospital<\/td>       <td>94<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>101<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital<\/td>       <td>1026<\/td>       <td>103<\/td>       <td>23<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>1159<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo University Hospital<\/td>       <td>338<\/td>       <td>294<\/td>       <td>74<\/td>       <td>30<\/td>       <td>736<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Small Volume Hospitals<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>       <td>38<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital<\/td>       <td>108<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>121<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>St. Vincent's University Hospital<\/td>       <td>165<\/td>       <td>38<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>215<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Limerick<\/td>       <td>164<\/td>       <td>112<\/td>       <td>22<\/td>       <td>30<\/td>       <td>328<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Waterford<\/td>       <td>131<\/td>       <td>95<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>       <td>93<\/td>       <td>337<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total<\/td>       <td>3633<\/td>       <td>987<\/td>       <td>185<\/td>       <td>208<\/td>       <td>5013<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300157#WREEEE05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Eating Disorders","counter":4022,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300157#WREEEE05300"},{"type":"question","counter":4023,"qnumday":1457,"qnumall":"[33802\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300157#WREEEE05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which services are readily available for children suffering from eating disorders nationally;

In particular, I fully acknowledge that community pharmacy has played a pivotal role in responding to the health needs of the public during the COVID-19 crisis. <\/p><p>It is recognised that community pharmacists have ensured the continued availability of a professional, accessible service for the public and have successfully managed to alleviate the worries and concerns of the population around continuity of medicine supply in the face of great uncertainty. This has been a period of unprecedented difficulty for the country and pharmacists have been at the forefront of the response.<\/p><p>The existing GMS pharmacy contract dates from 1996 and I accept that it is substantially outdated. It has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years including the increasing emphasis on maximising the proportion of people&rsquo;s healthcare needs met in primary care, interdisciplinary collaboration and the skillset that pharmacists have by virtue of their education and training. Patient safety and value-for-money considerations have also assumed increasing importance. <\/p><p>Accordingly, the programme for Government contains a commitment to commence talks with pharmacists on a new contract which will enhance their role in the delivery of healthcare in the community. <\/p><p>The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion, should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes.  <\/p><p>My Department officials and the HSE initiated work earlier this year to prepare for engagement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on contractual reform. However, the disruption and reprioritisation arising from the Covid-19 pandemic meant that this work could not be progressed in a meaningful way. It is anticipated that talks will commence in 2021.<\/p><p>In the context of Covid-19, there has been regular engagement with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU)throughout the past number of months and a significant number of contingency measures have been put in place under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Amendment Regulations, 2020, intended to relieve the pressures on community pharmacies and General Practitioners. There has also been recent engagement with the IPU on pharmacists&rsquo; participation in the extended flu vaccination programme. <\/p><p>The HSE has established a contingency planning working group with the IPU and Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures. The Group&rsquo;s primary role is to examine the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency. <\/p><p>This working group also represents an opportunity to discuss the strategic direction of the profession which will be valuable in the context of contractual reform in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300158#WRFFFF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":4033,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300158#WRFFFF01000"},{"type":"question","counter":4034,"qnumday":1461,"qnumall":"[33847\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300158#WRFFFF01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of data protection breaches identified within his Department in 2019","asker":"1466","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":4035,"content":"<p>There were two personal data breaches reported within my Department in 2019.  <\/p><p>The breaches were dealt with in accordance with the GDPR and the Department of Health Breach Management Policy. <\/p><p>Following risk assessments, the breaches were not notified to the Data Protection Commission.

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. <\/p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical.

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. Given the volumes required, these operate as batch tests and hence take a number of hours depending on the platform and the volume being processed.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE uses rapid tests in key clinical settings, such as in our hospitals for emergency and surgical care.  These are rapid PCR tests which give results in short timeframes, for example less than an hour. As part of the HSE&rsquo;s testing and tracing plan, it is trying to increase the number of these available as there is significant international demand and supply challenges. These tests only work in very small numbers so are not appropriate for large scale community testing.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the rapid non-PCR Covid tests reported in the media, which purport to offer a test result in minutes (for example antigen tests) lack the sensitivity and specificity required for healthcare.

The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  <\/p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges. <\/p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019\/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.

The Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020, commenced on 6th October 2020 made provision for the publication, personal information in relation to forestry licence applications, including submissions received.

Officials of my Department are liaising with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on the FLV project.

The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.<\/p>  <p>  There are also delays associated with the appeals process. The Deputy will be aware of the recent enactment of the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2020, which amends the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2010.  While no formal analysis of the potential for job losses has taken place, I know from engagement with stakeholders and from the submissions received during the public consultation on the Act that the current difficulties could have serious impact on jobs in the sector.  The Government gave commitments to reform the planning and appeals processes as set out in the Programme for Government and this Act is the result of this commitment.<\/p>  <p>  I have moved quickly to resource the FAC to realise the provisions as set out in the Act and have appointed 3 Deputy Chairs along with 2 ordinary members.

A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that a combination of a better resourced Forestry Appeals Committee, along with our systematic approach to the licensing backlog, will result in an increase in the number of licences issued to allow for planting and felling. This approach is already yielding results, with the highest volume of felling licences this year issued in October at some 750,000 m3.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to tackling the issues facing us and will put all efforts into maintaining a steady flow of licences to the sector.

My Department has adapted the conditions under which marts must operate since April, to reflect the various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid, and to allow marts to continue to operate.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.  I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of Covid, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  On 19th October, the Taoiseach announced that the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with COVID-19 for a period of 6 weeks, starting midnight on Wednesday, the 21st  .  The Taoiseach has called on us all to work together to suppress the virus, and to reopen as much of our society and economy as possible when it is safe to do so.  The core responsibility of this Government is to protect lives and to protect public health, while also protecting livelihoods and supporting the wider economy and society.<\/p>  <p>  Protecting the agrifood sector and people in rural communities is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s direction, on 20th   October, that all marts may continue, but to conduct sales using online platforms only. My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines. There are no plans at present to allow in-person attendance of buyers at sales at livestock marts, while Level 5 is in force. Buyers may make arrangements to view the stock available for sale by appointment with mart management.<\/p>  <p>  Marts have been using online mart sales systems since April. From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months. Currently, the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are operating through online platforms.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise.<\/p>  <p>  This is undoubtedly a challenging time.  My Department is closely monitoring the situation and will plan for a return to physical marts in line with public health guidelines when it is safe to do so. We are seeing some positive aspects of online sales at marts.<\/p>  <p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions. On Saturday 24th   October, the online sales companies reported to my officials that, at one stage, more than 40,000 people were logged into online mart sales. <\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of Level 5, during the first five days on which marts were in operation using online sales (the Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday), cattle throughput in marts came to 36,034 head &ndash; this compares to 42,918 head in the corresponding five day period in 2019. This means that, despite the undoubted disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 84% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts involved.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to mention the wide range of supports for businesses which the Government has put in place to help them through Covid.

The multi-functional benefits of forestry are well known including increased removal of carbon from our atmosphere, creation of more habitats rich in biodiversity and better water quality. This support is provided through generous grants and premiums under the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 which has made available over &euro;100m each year for the past 6 years for forestry development including afforestation. I was very pleased also to secure an allocation of &euro;103m in the budget for 2021 to continue these supports. This programme is due to end this year and arrangements are being put in place by my Department to ensure the continuation of these supports beyond 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Planting in 2020 will fall short of the target of 8,000 hectares set out under the Climate Action Plan. Achieving this level of planting in the years ahead will be challenging and will require shared action from farmers, private sector, public bodies and the community at large. I will shortly be commencing discussions for the next National Forestry Programme and one of my key aims will be to re-engage farmers in the programme. Planting of trees can help drive improved economic and environmental sustainability on Irish farms and I very much intend that farmers have more ownership of the next programme. The model for Ireland has to be more farm forestry. <\/p>  <p>  It is likely that we will need alternative sources of planting outside of private land if we are to deliver 8,000 hectares, which is why Coillte's proposed collaboration with Bord na Mona to plant their land over the next three years is very welcome. I am hopeful that other public bodies will follow suit and will be looking for support from my colleagues in Government, local authorities and others to help us achieve our national target. Just recently, my Department launched a new afforestation scheme aimed specifically at public bodies called the \"Creation of Woodlands on Public Lands' scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is to encourage Public Bodies to establish new native woodlands on suitable bare land. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are the first public body to secure approval for the establishment of a native forest under this scheme<\/p>  <p>  Businesses too can play their part.  A new Woodland Environmental Fund (WEF) provides an opportunity for businesses to contribute to the establishment of new native woodlands.  I am pleased to say that there is significant appetite amongst the business community to take part in this initiative thereby helping to meet the Climate Action Plan target. So far An Post, Accenture, KBI Global Investments, Microsoft, Aldi, Lidl and Applegreen have all committed to the WEF, resulting in the planting of almost 250,000 native trees across the country. Many other businesses have been in contact with my Department with a view to taking part, so we expect a pipeline of investment from the business community to develop in the new year. The amount of native woodlands planted as a percentage of total planting has reached record levels as a result of this scheme with 446 hectares planted so far this year. At the beginning of the forestry programme, native woodlands made up just 2% of total planting and the proportion now is 22%. <\/p>  <p>  Forests are excellent at sequestering carbon dioxide however depending on the species some trees will remove carbon at different rates. Broadleaves and conifers sequester roughly the same carbon dioxide; the maximum value is approximately 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare but this is achieved in 75 years for spruce, compared to 180 years for oak.  However, carbon sequestration does vary from year to year depending on  management and soil type. The afforestation scheme provides support for 12 different planting types in order that anybody considering panting has maximum flexibility and choice for different species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300162#WRKKKK05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Herd Data","counter":4277,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300162#WRKKKK05300"},{"type":"question","counter":4278,"qnumday":1547,"qnumall":"[33811\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300162#WRKKKK05400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the national beef herd has increased or decreased in the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4279,"content":"<p>The CSO's June Livestock Survey includes the information below for the years 2015-2019:<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>000 head<\/th>       <th><div>2015<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>2016<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>2017<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>2018<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>2019<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>*2020<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total cattle<\/td>       <td><div>6,964<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>7,221<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>7,364<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>7,348<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>    7209<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>7314<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>- of which:   Dairy cows<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,296<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,398<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,433<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,481<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>     1505<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1568<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>-of which: Other cows<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,076<\/div><\/td>       <td><div> 1,104<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,081<\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,048<\/div><\/td>       <td>1000<\/td>       <td><div>983<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Note that the figures for 2020 are provisional estimates. <\/p><p>This year the total cattle numbers increased by 105,800 (+1.5%) to 7,314,400. <\/p><p>The number of other cows dropped by 16,500 (-1.6%), while the number of <i>dairy cows<\/i>was up by 62,900 (+4.2%).<\/p><p>More detailed data from the CSO's June and December Livestock Surveys each year is available at the following links: <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300162#WRKKKK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":4282,"qnumday":1548,"qnumall":"[33812\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300163#WRLLLL00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the numbers in the national dairy herd have altered in the past ten years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4283,"content":"<p>Data on the national herd are published twice yearly by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on the basis of two categories; dairy and other cows.

We are seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in terms of both quota share and access to UK waters. From the outset of the negotiations, Ireland and our EU partners have been clear on our level of ambition in this area and on the fact that progress on an overall trade deal is linked to progress on fisheries. This is reflected in the EU negotiation mandate and the draft EU legal text. This Government fully supports the EU negotiating mandate to maintain quota shares and current access going forward.<\/p>  <p>  Since taking office, I have held meetings with both Michel Barnier and the Fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius by video link. I have made it clear to both Mr Barnier and the Commissioner that we are placing our full reliance on them to deliver on the agreed EU negotiation mandate that sets down clearly the EU objective to &ldquo;uphold existing reciprocal access conditions, quota shares and traditional activity of the Union fleet.\" <\/p>  <p>  I have also met with representatives of the Irish fishing industry on 12th October, where I listened carefully to the clearly articulated challenges facing the fishing industry in the context of Brexit. I made clear that I will be pressing for a fisheries agreement with the UK that upholds both existing quota shares and existing reciprocal access to UK waters. I will continue to press for the maintenance of the linkage of fisheries to the overall economic partnership agreement as this will be central to a successful agreement.  I assured the industry representatives of my commitment and that of the Government to work towards a fisheries agreement with the UK that protects their interests and ensures a long-term future for our coastal communities dependant on fisheries<\/p>  <p>  In the event that a Fisheries Agreement between the UK and the EU is not put in place by the end of 2020 (the EU has specified that such an agreement must be agreed in the overall context of future partnership), the key issues for the Irish fishing sector are the potential loss of access for Irish and other EU vessels to the UK fishing zone, the need to ensure ongoing protection of fish stocks in the waters around Ireland from a subsequent increase in fishing activity and potential supports for the seafood sector to meet the challenges they may face.  It is important to be aware that, if a fisheries agreement is not agreed, the EU and Ireland could also face a loss of quota share. In this situation, it will be necessary for a co-ordinated European response to ensure a proportionate and equitable use of mitigation measures for the EU fishing fleet, overseen by the EU Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the threat of a UK departure without a Withdrawal agreement, the EU Member States prepared an EU Brexit Contingency plan that was published on the 10th April 2019.  This highlighted fisheries as one of the most immediately critical issues facing the EU in a no-deal Brexit.   In the event of a Fisheries Agreement is not agreed, we could immediately face the situation of the UK deciding to deny EU fishing vessels from EU waters in 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  I am preparing for all scenarios, while strongly supporting the negotiation of a Fisheries agreement in line with the negotiating mandate. I will be seeking additional EU funds to support mitigation measures if they become necessary.  In that regard, the &euro;5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund agreed as part of the EU budget for the next seven years recognises that if a future relationship agreement is not in place, it will be essential to provide financial support to counter unforeseen and adverse consequences in Member States and sectors that are worst affected and this would clearly apply to the fisheries sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300164#WRMMMM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tuberculosis Incidence","counter":4333,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300164#WRMMMM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":4334,"qnumday":1567,"qnumall":"[33929\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300164#WRMMMM00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of herds which have TB restrictions placed on them; if his Department can remove restrictions on herds more quickly after testing negative subsequently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1622","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4335,"content":"<p>As of 25th October 2020, the number of Herds with TB restrictions placed on them is 2,873.

I would like to commend the representative organisations for this good and necessary cooperation.  I would like to commend also the marts themselves, and farmers around the country, for the resilience they have shown in the face of this pandemic, and the speed with which they have adapted to the new circumstances.  <\/p><p>My Department has adapted the conditions under which marts must operate since April, to reflect the various measures introduced by the Government to stop the spread of Covid19 and to allow marts to continue to operate. <\/p><p>From April to June 8<sup>th<\/sup>, marts operated without public attendance at sales rings, with marts able to operate transactions online or facilitate the brokering of sales, including the weighing and viewing of stock and the safe processing of financial transactions for buyers and sellers.

Currently the vast majority of marts have online systems in place and are  operating through online platforms.  Some remaining marts are in the process of installing online systems.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise. <\/p><p>Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.

This means that, despite the undoubted immediate disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 84% of the figures for that period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts and service providers involved. Buyers may still view animals in person by prior appointment with the relevant mart.<\/p><p>These figures are testament to the hard work and commitment of marts to keep operating in this difficult period.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines.

Findings highlighted weaknesses in the current control environment.  The financial management and governance of the company were identified as requiring immediate action.  There had also been some contact  in relation to the matter by individuals within WAP to both my Department and Waterford City and County Council, however no protected disclosures were made.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, Pobal and Waterford City and County Council have met regularly since January to discuss the audit findings and to agree solutions.  The overall priority has been to ensure the continued delivery of programmes such as the Social Inclusion Community Activation Programme (SICAP) and that supports and services to disadvantaged individuals and communities continue to be delivered, particularly in the context of COVID-19, while also ensuring that the findings of the audit process are addressed as quickly as possible.   As part of this process, WAP were required to submit a detailed proposal setting out the actions and timelines for addressing the audit findings and the associated costs. <\/p>  <p>  The plan submitted indicated an acceptance by WAP of the audit findings and a willingness and openness to address the issues arising.   The local authority, Pobal and DRCD acknowledged  the continuing work being undertaken by WAP and in particular their ongoing work through SICAP and their contribution to the local efforts to address the unprecedented level of need arising from the COVID-19 crisis. <\/p>  <p>  It was also agreed to work with and support the WAP Board of Directors in building on their efforts to date to address governance weaknesses.  As part of the collaborative approach to date, an external company has been engaged to work with WAP to put in place a more sustainable governance structure to ensure the continued delivery of social inclusion programmes in Waterford.  The cost of this external support is &euro;25,168.<\/p>  <p>  On the separate matter of monies being reclaimed by Waterford LCDC (who manage the SICAP contract locally), on foot of a Pobal audit, it was established that WAP spent some of their 2015 SICAP allocation outside programme rules.  This resulted in a financial correction being imposed on WAP.  SICAP programme rules must be strictly applied and complied with, particularly given that the programme is part funded by the EU through the European Social Fund.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300164#WRMMMM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":4360,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300164#WRMMMM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":4361,"qnumday":1580,"qnumall":"[32520\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110300164#WRMMMM03900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1481 of 8 September 2020, the status of an appeal by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":4362,"content":"<p>My Department is aware of the challenges facing community and voluntary organisations and is committed to working closely with the sector in managing through these, recognising that it will require a whole of Government approach.<\/p><p>The Community and Voluntary Sector Covid-19 Stability Fund was intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups currently delivering critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19.
