I have received apologies from the Chairman, Deputy Stanley, and from Deputies Verona Murphy and Colm Burke.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Today is the second day of a two-day engagement with officials from the Department of Justice.  Officials from the Irish Prison Service are also in attendance today to assist us in examining the following: from the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation account for 2019, Vote 21 &ndash; Prisons, and from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts of the public service 2019, Chapter 7 &ndash; catering and ancillary services in prisons.<\/p> <p>  With regard to public health guidelines, we are joined in person by Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Accounting Officer for Vote 21 - Prisons, Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general of the Irish Prison Service - it is all very female today - and Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation in the Irish Prison Service.<\/p> <p>  We are also joined remotely by Mr. Don Culliton, director of human resources in the Irish Prison Service; Mr. Derek Caldbeck, director of finance and estates in the Irish Prison Service; Mr. Doncha O&rsquo;Sullivan, assistant secretary at the Department of Justice; and Mr. Liam Gleeson, from the justice Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  I welcome all the witnesses to the meeting and I thank them and the staff in the Department of Justice for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Witnesses, however, are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Vice Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory with regard to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and frankly, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard, and that when members are leaving and are taking their seats that they sanitise their area.  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#A00500","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of Justice but is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21.  While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the Prison Service is headed operationally by its director general.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 21 - Prisons records gross expenditure of &euro;358 million.  More than two thirds of the expenditure, totalling &euro;255 million, relates to pay.  The remainder is spread across a range of areas, including maintenance and improvements to the prison estate, equipment purchase, education and services for prisoners and other operating costs.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the account.  However, I drew attention in my report on the audit to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts operating in 2019.<\/p> <p>  I will turn now to the report on catering and ancillary services in prisons.  Catering in prisons is a significant operation involving the preparation and provision of meals every day to an average of nearly 4,000 prisoners at 12 locations across the State.  A number of related services also operating within prisons are not funded by the Irish Prison Service.  These include mess committees operating staff catering services and prison shops whose profits are transferred to a separate fund for the benefit of prisoners.  The report examined the controls over all of those services.<\/p> <p>  With regard to catering, our focus was on controls over food purchases and food stocks.  The Irish Prison Service has devised a 28-day menu plan which is used in all prisons.  In 2019, the Irish Prison Service incurred expenditure of &euro;8.2 million on catering purchases.  We found that the cost of providing prisoner meals ranged from a low of &euro;4.54 per prisoner per day in Wheatfield Prison to a high of &euro;7.27 in Portlaoise Prison, a variance of 60%.<\/p> <p>  A review of items charged to prisoner education and training budgets noted some non-standard high value food items repeatedly purchased in one prison.  These items were not called for in the standard prisons menu plan.  I understand the governor of the prison in question has been investigating the circumstances surrounding that expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The scope of the examination also included a review of the operation of voluntary mess committees in most prisons, which co-ordinate the running of canteen facilities for prison staff.  The committees use kitchen facilities provided in prison premises free of charge.  The food is prepared under a training regime for prisoners.  The committees can purchase food from approved suppliers at prices agreed under Irish Prison Service contracts.  The prices charged for staff meals are set by the committees with the aim of recouping the costs of the inputs.<\/p> <p>  The relationship between the Prison Service and the mess committees is not covered by a written agreement.  While the Irish Prison Service has issued some governance guidance to the committees, it did not seek formal assurances that the guidance was being followed.  Overall, we found that the Irish Prison Service did not have adequate processes in place to ensure there is no unintended subsidisation of food costs for the staff committees.<\/p> <p>  Each prison operates a shop facilitating the purchase by prisoners of a range of items, including confectionary, cigarettes, soft drinks and toiletries.<\/p><p>With a small number of exceptions, stock items are procured from an approved central supplier at wholesale prices.  Payment for shop sales is deducted electronically from funds held in the respective prisoners' personal money accounts, which are managed by the Prison Service.  Until April 2019, staff were also allowed to make cash purchases from the shops, which resulted in cash handling and additional control needs.  In 2019, gross profits of just over &euro;1 million were generated from sales of nearly &euro;7 million in the shops across all prisons.  Gross profit margins ranged from 8% in the Midlands Prison to 21% in Castlerea Prison.<\/p><p> The examination raised a number of issues in respect of the operation of the prison shops, including weaknesses in controls over stock and cash purchases and delays in the submission of accounts and bank reconciliations.  Profits from shop sales in each prison are transferred to dedicated funds, known as prisoner assist programme funds.  These are intended to be used only for the benefit of prisoners.  Our examination found some examples where expenditure from the funds was not in accordance with procedures set out by the Prison Service.  This included a number of payments for the benefit of staff and some payments related to the operation of the prison that should instead have been charged to the Vote.<\/p><p> I made a number of recommendations for improvements in controls, all of which have been accepted by the Prison Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>In advance of inviting Ms McPhillips and Ms McCaffrey to make their opening statements, I wish to agree the speaking rota.

I propose to keep my opening remarks brief and then hand over to the director general of the Prison Service, Ms McCaffrey.<\/p> <p>  The Prison Service is a key component of the criminal justice system and its voted expenditure is directed towards one strategic programme: provision of safe, secure, humane and rehabilitative custody for people sent to prison.  The gross expenditure under the Vote in 2019 was &euro;357.9 million, of which 71% related to payroll costs, 22% related to non-pay current expenditure and 7%, or &euro;26.6 million, was capital related.  The Prison Service operates 12 prisons.  There were 8,939 committals to prisons, with a daily average of 3,971 prisoners in custody, during 2019.  In total, there were 3,405 full-time equivalent staff in the Irish Prison Service, IPS, at the end of 2019.<\/p> <p>  The IPS is an executive office of the Department of Justice and operates within policy parameters established by the Minister as well as within statute, such as the prison rules.  The Secretary General of the day is the Accounting Officer for the Vote and the director general and her team, including prison governors, manage the day-to-day operation of the 12 prisons around the country and the IPS's headquarters in Longford.  The governance relationship between the Department and the IPS is underpinned by an oversight agreement between us in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The current agreement runs from 2020 to 2022, with provision for review and amendment annually as required.  It sets out the respective roles and responsibilities of both parties, along with the key corporate governance compliance and reporting obligations of the IPS.  It also provides for a minimum of four formal governance meetings per year, which are chaired by the assistant secretary with responsibility for governance of criminal justice bodies.<\/p> <p>  The difficulties of managing Covid-19 in institutional settings throughout the country have been particularly challenging.  This has been accentuated in the high-risk, closed environment of our prisons.  A significant amount of work has been carried out by the IPS to address this challenge.  The measures taken have been informed and guided by the advice provided by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and consistent with the prison-specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the WHO in March and the human rights guidance issued by the Council of Europe.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that, similar to other areas of Irish society, this has been a difficult and worrying time for prison staff, offenders and their families.  Great efforts have been made to limit and curtail the spread of the virus in the prisons, including close co-operation with our health service colleagues on outbreak control and the establishment of a robust contact tracing model, which has been acknowledged by the WHO as best practice for prisons worldwide.  I am proud of the work the IPS team has done and it and the prisoners themselves are to be commended on the manner in which the challenge of Covid-19 has been managed to date.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Ms McCaffrey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh McPhillips"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to meet it today.  As Ms McPhillips stated, 2020 has been a challenging year for our service, but I am proud to say that it is a challenge that has been embraced by our staff and those in our care.  We have worked together to chart our way through this pandemic successfully.  Critical to our success has been our experience in dealing with previous outbreaks of infectious diseases in prisons, including tuberculosis.  We have used those lessons to build robust infection control structures at national and local levels.  This work forms a small part of a broader agenda of enhanced risk management within our service.<\/p> <p>  Deputies will be aware of the recent report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, following its visit to Ireland in 2019.  I welcome the CPT's acknowledgement of the ongoing positive steps that were taken by our service since its 2014 visit.  The IPS has been on a journey of transformation, and this transformational journey touches all facets of our organisation, including security, prison regimes, governance, risk management and financial control.<\/p> <p>  In September, the Comptroller and Auditor General published the report on the accounts of the public service, which included a chapter on catering and ancillary services in our prisons.  I thank him for this important and valuable piece of work.  The report made a number of recommendations, and I wish to mention some of the actions we are taking in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The provision of high-quality, nutritious food for prisoners is an essential operation within our prisons on a daily basis.  The total annual catering cost for prisoners in 2019 was &euro;8.5 million.  The average daily cost of food per prisoner has changed little in recent years from &euro;5.41 in 2016 to &euro;5.66 in 2019.  This differs little from costs incurred ten years earlier in 2009 when the average cost for per prisoner per day was &euro;5.67.  Prison demographics, such as age, addiction levels, fitness, poverty and homelessness, can influence quantities consumed by people in custody.<\/p> <p>  The IPS has introduced a range of measures to strengthen and enhance the oversight of food procurement and supply.  In 2019, in order to strengthen controls, I reintroduced a catering supervisory grade with direct responsibility for food ordering, stock control, compliance and prisoner training in all closed prisons.  The service is also developing a new procurement requisitioning system, which will go live in early 2021 and will deliver a better segregation of duties in ordering, delivery and payment.  Further enhancements, including the introduction of food usage reports and more detailed expenditure reports, have also been introduced on a monthly basis and are being monitored by our headquarters.  These actions will greatly enhance the oversight and monitoring of catering and food usage in each location.<\/p> <p>  Regarding voluntary mess committees, we have recently completed a governance review of their operation and are implementing stronger governance arrangements, which includes the signing of an annual service agreement.  This agreement sets out clear arrangements, including the provision of an annual statement of compliance and the preparation and submission of annual audited accounts.<\/p> <p>  The report has made a number of recommendations on the operation of prison tuck shops, including the updating of shop accounting systems, and work is ongoing in this regard.  A tender for a new inventory management system, which will integrate with our financial and reporting systems, will be published before the end of this year.  The new system will automate stock management processes, thereby delivering better stock controls and providing management information to allow for better analysis of stock purchases.<\/p> <p>  The report made recommendations about the operation of the prisoner assist programme funds.  I wish to advise the committee that, earlier this year, I decided to eliminate this programme and replace it with a centrally managed Vote-funded programme for prisoner initiatives.  This will eliminate the need to run prison shops on a profit-making basis and allow the introduction of a new pricing system, which will see all non-tobacco products sold at almost-cost price.  This will benefit prisoners and their families greatly and eliminate the need to increase the prisoner gratuity payment, which has not been increased for a significant time.  Separately, profits from the sale of tobacco-related products will continue to provide funding for a new prisoner hardship fund, which will be managed by governors and administered through the prisoner account management system.<\/p> <p>  The Secretary General and I will be happy to take whatever questions committee members may have on the 2019 appropriation accounts and the chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses.

We have seen the coverage of this story in the press in recent weeks.  It is a huge amount of money to have so little information about in terms of receipts.  I see the Prison Service brought back the supervisory grade and that is to be commended but we are lagging in terms of change.<\/p> <p>  The knee-jerk reaction to these issues in the media will be for people to see things such as prisoners ordering steak and prosciutto and for it to be quite divisive.  I will not do that.  One of the points I want to make before going to the questions is that training people in catering is useful and has been a success in the Prison Service.  Particularly in the workforce in Ireland, we need catering staff and it is a constant lack in our workforce.  Therefore, I commend the Prison Service for focusing on it.  I do not think anybody wants to see money being spent on items such as steak and prosciutto but within reason it should be supported.  One of the points I want to make is that I hope these processes and a new focus on procurement do not begin a race to the bottom and cost-cutting in areas that would affect the training because it is very important that it is supported.<\/p> <p>  One of my questions is on the new procurement and requisitioning system.  Where is the progress on this?  We have been given a number of details on how it would look.  One of the issues in dealing with the level of supplies the Prison Service will be looking at is local purchasing processes and issues such as community wealth building.  Within these new procurement measures, has the Prison Service considered issues such as community wealth building and local buying?  There is a large prison in my constituency of Dublin Central and it is embedded in the community.  It does have a huge impact on the local community.  Has this been considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#F02100","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Approximately 95% of the food purchased, particularly for the tuck shops, comes from a central supply in place through an Office of Government Procurement contract.  Some purchasing does take place locally for approximately 5% of all of the items bought for the tuck shop, such as newspapers, fresh fruit, birthday cards and such items.  We are bound by procurement rules and we do go to tender on those contracts and draw from an approved supplier list.  With regard to the new purchase requisitioning system, effectively what happens at present is that food is ordered locally.  The new system will mean the order is generated locally but it will be approved centrally before that order is placed.  The order will also be from an approved catalogue.  The Deputy pointed to issues in the D&oacute;chas Centre, which constitutes one 20th of our overall catering budget so we need to keep it in context.  There will be much tighter arrangements on buying from approved product lists and people will not have the ability to buy off-contract items without approval from headquarters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#F02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I want to flag that the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is introducing new green procurement and it might be something to consider in future with regard to local support for local food.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#F02300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>If the Deputy has time I will ask Mr. Black to come in on the training aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#F02400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

I was at the convention centre earlier because the Minister for Justice was before the D&aacute;il.  I am sorry for not being here for our guests' presentation.<\/p> <p>  I wish to quickly raise three issues.  The old prison in Cork has been closed and a brand new one built.  It was a very good project and well delivered.  What is the plan for the old prison?  Are plans already in place there?<\/p> <p>  I also raise the matter of healthcare costs in prisons.  I understand that quite a number of people in prison have hepatitis C.  I understand that there is a healthcare programme over 12 weeks that can leave prisoners completely clear of hepatitis C if they stick to it.  I understand the programme has now been introduced in Cork.  The product involved is also manufactured in Cork.  Are we doing enough for the healthcare of prisoners?  Some people are in prison for six months, 12 months or three years.  A 12-week programme of constant treatment can resolve an issue for them forever.<\/p> <p>  I will also touch on a matter relating to compensation and legal costs for claims.  The figures for 2018 and 2019 are set out in the report.  There were 94 claims by prison staff.  I am not sure when those claims were made.  Were they actually made in 2019 or were they finalised in that year?  There were 26 claims for criminal injuries compensation, and 175 claims arising out of injuries and other actions involving prisoners.  There were 40 claims from members of the public.  We are only given the number of claims per year in this report because it deals with the financial aspect.  Will our guests give us an idea of what numbers, on average, we are having in claims per annum from prison officers, prisoners and members of the public?  Over the next few years, are we going to have an increase in the level of compensation in this area?  Our guests might give us some details on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#H01700","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>If it is okay with the Deputy, I will take that last item first.

I do not have figures for the claims that have been made, but we will certainly send them to the committee before the end of the day.<\/p> <p>  I should say that we have quite a good engagement with the State Claims Agency, which is responsible for managing slips, trips and falls in personal injury claims.  It is also responsible for managing claims relating to slopping out.  We are doing extensive work with the agency to identify the reasons behind those claims and understand why issues are arising, and then to take the appropriate action to ensure they do not occur again.  I mentioned in my opening statement that we have had some historical claims relating to tuberculosis.  There were 99 claims relating to an outbreak in Cloverhill and 44 relating to an outbreak in Shelton Abbey.  As a result of that, we have done extensive work on infection control so that we are now in a position to keep our prisons effectively free of Covid-19.  We learn from claims and analyse their causes.

Perhaps this time around a final, single report from that office will achieve what the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service cannot.  As I said, this has been going on for years.  We are back here each year raising the same issues.  Successive Comptrollers and Auditors General have flagged up the same irregularities.  Therefore, for once and for all I would like the committee to support the recommendation that we write to the Minister requesting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#L00800","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I suggest we bring in the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has quite a bit of oversight in respect of changes and the deficiencies.

The milk issue bears out the point I have raised.  I was accused by the previous Secretary General of not having tested things in advance.  We only raise issues if people raise them with us.  The milk issue proves that it could happen, and indeed did happen in at least one instance.  Some years ago, I raised multiple instances of cross-subsidisation between prison stores and mess stores.  We have new controls now, but we have no accounts.  After our meeting in 2019, we got a list of balances of accounts and nothing more.<\/p><p> The memorandum issued by the Irish Prison Officers Association, IPOA, seeking approval for the establishment of messes states that 40% of staff spend &euro;10.61 per day.  I will quote the IPOA's figures.  The State provides &euro;1.4 million of subsidies for staff, equipment, heat, light, etc., and the system works very well.  If &euro;10.61 was spent per day by 470 staff members, a substantial amount of money would be raised every day throughout the eight prisons.  If we multiply that by 365 and then by seven we arrive at a figure of several millions.  I note that these were all cash transactions.  I join Deputy Munster in suggesting that we get an external investigator to look through those seven years' figures to ensure the milk issue was a once-off.  I hope that would be supported by the Irish Prison Service.  In case the IPOA is watching, I want to make it absolutely clear that I am totally in favour of the appropriate supports for hard-working prison officers.  Their job is a very difficult one.  There is probably an argument for them to be fed and watered free of charge given the dangers of their job.  It is not about those facilities.  It is about the appropriate oversight of many millions of euro of subsidy during that seven-year period, for which there are effectively no records. <\/p><p> Yesterday, I raised the issue of protected disclosures and the terms of reference of external investigations.

I am delighted and honoured to have been appointed Chairman.  I welcome all members of the third Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Petitions.  The committee's first task is to review its terms of reference and report to the D&aacute;il and Seanad within three months.  The committee has three main roles.  First, all petitions submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas stand referred to the committee.  Second, the committee may decide to examine matters of general public concern or interest or issues of public policy and third, the committee may consider reports of the Ombudsman.<\/p> <p>  The petitions committee has a unique role in the Parliament.  People have direct access to the Parliament using an informal process, people have a right to reply and petitions can act as a safety valve or fire alarm when reviewing public policy.  I look forward to working with all members in the genuine spirit of partnership and co-operation as we review the terms of reference and consider petitions.  We all have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in our lives, and how we conduct the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas has been altered in ways we could not have envisaged when the year began.  I trust that all members will work with me and will ensure that the committee works effectively and safely during these testing times.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is the election of a Vice Chairman but the protocol to date has been to fix a date for the election at the second meeting.

For this committee to continue in its work, public or private, those comments need to be clarified.  They were publicly made, and made very recently.  They are not comments from the past that someone has dug up.  You are not denying you made comments on this matter yesterday in a public forum.
