I have received apologies from the Chairman, Deputy Stanley, and from Deputies Verona Murphy and Colm Burke.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Today is the second day of a two-day engagement with officials from the Department of Justice.  Officials from the Irish Prison Service are also in attendance today to assist us in examining the following: from the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation account for 2019, Vote 21 &ndash; Prisons, and from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts of the public service 2019, Chapter 7 &ndash; catering and ancillary services in prisons.<\/p> <p>  With regard to public health guidelines, we are joined in person by Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Accounting Officer for Vote 21 - Prisons, Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general of the Irish Prison Service - it is all very female today - and Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation in the Irish Prison Service.<\/p> <p>  We are also joined remotely by Mr. Don Culliton, director of human resources in the Irish Prison Service; Mr. Derek Caldbeck, director of finance and estates in the Irish Prison Service; Mr. Doncha O&rsquo;Sullivan, assistant secretary at the Department of Justice; and Mr. Liam Gleeson, from the justice Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  I welcome all the witnesses to the meeting and I thank them and the staff in the Department of Justice for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Witnesses, however, are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Vice Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory with regard to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and frankly, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard, and that when members are leaving and are taking their seats that they sanitise their area.  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#A00500","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of Justice but is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21.  While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the Prison Service is headed operationally by its director general.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 21 - Prisons records gross expenditure of &euro;358 million.  More than two thirds of the expenditure, totalling &euro;255 million, relates to pay.  The remainder is spread across a range of areas, including maintenance and improvements to the prison estate, equipment purchase, education and services for prisoners and other operating costs.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the account.  However, I drew attention in my report on the audit to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts operating in 2019.<\/p> <p>  I will turn now to the report on catering and ancillary services in prisons.  Catering in prisons is a significant operation involving the preparation and provision of meals every day to an average of nearly 4,000 prisoners at 12 locations across the State.  A number of related services also operating within prisons are not funded by the Irish Prison Service.  These include mess committees operating staff catering services and prison shops whose profits are transferred to a separate fund for the benefit of prisoners.  The report examined the controls over all of those services.<\/p> <p>  With regard to catering, our focus was on controls over food purchases and food stocks.  The Irish Prison Service has devised a 28-day menu plan which is used in all prisons.  In 2019, the Irish Prison Service incurred expenditure of &euro;8.2 million on catering purchases.  We found that the cost of providing prisoner meals ranged from a low of &euro;4.54 per prisoner per day in Wheatfield Prison to a high of &euro;7.27 in Portlaoise Prison, a variance of 60%.<\/p> <p>  A review of items charged to prisoner education and training budgets noted some non-standard high value food items repeatedly purchased in one prison.  These items were not called for in the standard prisons menu plan.  I understand the governor of the prison in question has been investigating the circumstances surrounding that expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The scope of the examination also included a review of the operation of voluntary mess committees in most prisons, which co-ordinate the running of canteen facilities for prison staff.  The committees use kitchen facilities provided in prison premises free of charge.  The food is prepared under a training regime for prisoners.  The committees can purchase food from approved suppliers at prices agreed under Irish Prison Service contracts.  The prices charged for staff meals are set by the committees with the aim of recouping the costs of the inputs.<\/p> <p>  The relationship between the Prison Service and the mess committees is not covered by a written agreement.  While the Irish Prison Service has issued some governance guidance to the committees, it did not seek formal assurances that the guidance was being followed.  Overall, we found that the Irish Prison Service did not have adequate processes in place to ensure there is no unintended subsidisation of food costs for the staff committees.<\/p> <p>  Each prison operates a shop facilitating the purchase by prisoners of a range of items, including confectionary, cigarettes, soft drinks and toiletries.<\/p><p>With a small number of exceptions, stock items are procured from an approved central supplier at wholesale prices.  Payment for shop sales is deducted electronically from funds held in the respective prisoners' personal money accounts, which are managed by the Prison Service.  Until April 2019, staff were also allowed to make cash purchases from the shops, which resulted in cash handling and additional control needs.  In 2019, gross profits of just over &euro;1 million were generated from sales of nearly &euro;7 million in the shops across all prisons.  Gross profit margins ranged from 8% in the Midlands Prison to 21% in Castlerea Prison.<\/p><p> The examination raised a number of issues in respect of the operation of the prison shops, including weaknesses in controls over stock and cash purchases and delays in the submission of accounts and bank reconciliations.  Profits from shop sales in each prison are transferred to dedicated funds, known as prisoner assist programme funds.  These are intended to be used only for the benefit of prisoners.  Our examination found some examples where expenditure from the funds was not in accordance with procedures set out by the Prison Service.  This included a number of payments for the benefit of staff and some payments related to the operation of the prison that should instead have been charged to the Vote.<\/p><p> I made a number of recommendations for improvements in controls, all of which have been accepted by the Prison Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>In advance of inviting Ms McPhillips and Ms McCaffrey to make their opening statements, I wish to agree the speaking rota.

I propose to keep my opening remarks brief and then hand over to the director general of the Prison Service, Ms McCaffrey.<\/p> <p>  The Prison Service is a key component of the criminal justice system and its voted expenditure is directed towards one strategic programme: provision of safe, secure, humane and rehabilitative custody for people sent to prison.  The gross expenditure under the Vote in 2019 was &euro;357.9 million, of which 71% related to payroll costs, 22% related to non-pay current expenditure and 7%, or &euro;26.6 million, was capital related.  The Prison Service operates 12 prisons.  There were 8,939 committals to prisons, with a daily average of 3,971 prisoners in custody, during 2019.  In total, there were 3,405 full-time equivalent staff in the Irish Prison Service, IPS, at the end of 2019.<\/p> <p>  The IPS is an executive office of the Department of Justice and operates within policy parameters established by the Minister as well as within statute, such as the prison rules.  The Secretary General of the day is the Accounting Officer for the Vote and the director general and her team, including prison governors, manage the day-to-day operation of the 12 prisons around the country and the IPS's headquarters in Longford.  The governance relationship between the Department and the IPS is underpinned by an oversight agreement between us in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The current agreement runs from 2020 to 2022, with provision for review and amendment annually as required.  It sets out the respective roles and responsibilities of both parties, along with the key corporate governance compliance and reporting obligations of the IPS.  It also provides for a minimum of four formal governance meetings per year, which are chaired by the assistant secretary with responsibility for governance of criminal justice bodies.<\/p> <p>  The difficulties of managing Covid-19 in institutional settings throughout the country have been particularly challenging.  This has been accentuated in the high-risk, closed environment of our prisons.  A significant amount of work has been carried out by the IPS to address this challenge.  The measures taken have been informed and guided by the advice provided by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and consistent with the prison-specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the WHO in March and the human rights guidance issued by the Council of Europe.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that, similar to other areas of Irish society, this has been a difficult and worrying time for prison staff, offenders and their families.  Great efforts have been made to limit and curtail the spread of the virus in the prisons, including close co-operation with our health service colleagues on outbreak control and the establishment of a robust contact tracing model, which has been acknowledged by the WHO as best practice for prisons worldwide.  I am proud of the work the IPS team has done and it and the prisoners themselves are to be commended on the manner in which the challenge of Covid-19 has been managed to date.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Ms McCaffrey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh McPhillips"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to meet it today.  As Ms McPhillips stated, 2020 has been a challenging year for our service, but I am proud to say that it is a challenge that has been embraced by our staff and those in our care.  We have worked together to chart our way through this pandemic successfully.  Critical to our success has been our experience in dealing with previous outbreaks of infectious diseases in prisons, including tuberculosis.  We have used those lessons to build robust infection control structures at national and local levels.  This work forms a small part of a broader agenda of enhanced risk management within our service.<\/p> <p>  Deputies will be aware of the recent report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, following its visit to Ireland in 2019.  I welcome the CPT's acknowledgement of the ongoing positive steps that were taken by our service since its 2014 visit.  The IPS has been on a journey of transformation, and this transformational journey touches all facets of our organisation, including security, prison regimes, governance, risk management and financial control.<\/p> <p>  In September, the Comptroller and Auditor General published the report on the accounts of the public service, which included a chapter on catering and ancillary services in our prisons.  I thank him for this important and valuable piece of work.  The report made a number of recommendations, and I wish to mention some of the actions we are taking in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The provision of high-quality, nutritious food for prisoners is an essential operation within our prisons on a daily basis.  The total annual catering cost for prisoners in 2019 was &euro;8.5 million.  The average daily cost of food per prisoner has changed little in recent years from &euro;5.41 in 2016 to &euro;5.66 in 2019.  This differs little from costs incurred ten years earlier in 2009 when the average cost for per prisoner per day was &euro;5.67.  Prison demographics, such as age, addiction levels, fitness, poverty and homelessness, can influence quantities consumed by people in custody.<\/p> <p>  The IPS has introduced a range of measures to strengthen and enhance the oversight of food procurement and supply.  In 2019, in order to strengthen controls, I reintroduced a catering supervisory grade with direct responsibility for food ordering, stock control, compliance and prisoner training in all closed prisons.  The service is also developing a new procurement requisitioning system, which will go live in early 2021 and will deliver a better segregation of duties in ordering, delivery and payment.  Further enhancements, including the introduction of food usage reports and more detailed expenditure reports, have also been introduced on a monthly basis and are being monitored by our headquarters.  These actions will greatly enhance the oversight and monitoring of catering and food usage in each location.<\/p> <p>  Regarding voluntary mess committees, we have recently completed a governance review of their operation and are implementing stronger governance arrangements, which includes the signing of an annual service agreement.  This agreement sets out clear arrangements, including the provision of an annual statement of compliance and the preparation and submission of annual audited accounts.<\/p> <p>  The report has made a number of recommendations on the operation of prison tuck shops, including the updating of shop accounting systems, and work is ongoing in this regard.  A tender for a new inventory management system, which will integrate with our financial and reporting systems, will be published before the end of this year.  The new system will automate stock management processes, thereby delivering better stock controls and providing management information to allow for better analysis of stock purchases.<\/p> <p>  The report made recommendations about the operation of the prisoner assist programme funds.  I wish to advise the committee that, earlier this year, I decided to eliminate this programme and replace it with a centrally managed Vote-funded programme for prisoner initiatives.  This will eliminate the need to run prison shops on a profit-making basis and allow the introduction of a new pricing system, which will see all non-tobacco products sold at almost-cost price.  This will benefit prisoners and their families greatly and eliminate the need to increase the prisoner gratuity payment, which has not been increased for a significant time.  Separately, profits from the sale of tobacco-related products will continue to provide funding for a new prisoner hardship fund, which will be managed by governors and administered through the prisoner account management system.<\/p> <p>  The Secretary General and I will be happy to take whatever questions committee members may have on the 2019 appropriation accounts and the chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses.

We have seen the coverage of this story in the press in recent weeks.  It is a huge amount of money to have so little information about in terms of receipts.  I see the Prison Service brought back the supervisory grade and that is to be commended but we are lagging in terms of change.<\/p> <p>  The knee-jerk reaction to these issues in the media will be for people to see things such as prisoners ordering steak and prosciutto and for it to be quite divisive.  I will not do that.  One of the points I want to make before going to the questions is that training people in catering is useful and has been a success in the Prison Service.  Particularly in the workforce in Ireland, we need catering staff and it is a constant lack in our workforce.  Therefore, I commend the Prison Service for focusing on it.  I do not think anybody wants to see money being spent on items such as steak and prosciutto but within reason it should be supported.  One of the points I want to make is that I hope these processes and a new focus on procurement do not begin a race to the bottom and cost-cutting in areas that would affect the training because it is very important that it is supported.<\/p> <p>  One of my questions is on the new procurement and requisitioning system.  Where is the progress on this?  We have been given a number of details on how it would look.  One of the issues in dealing with the level of supplies the Prison Service will be looking at is local purchasing processes and issues such as community wealth building.  Within these new procurement measures, has the Prison Service considered issues such as community wealth building and local buying?  There is a large prison in my constituency of Dublin Central and it is embedded in the community.  It does have a huge impact on the local community.  Has this been considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#F02100","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Approximately 95% of the food purchased, particularly for the tuck shops, comes from a central supply in place through an Office of Government Procurement contract.  Some purchasing does take place locally for approximately 5% of all of the items bought for the tuck shop, such as newspapers, fresh fruit, birthday cards and such items.  We are bound by procurement rules and we do go to tender on those contracts and draw from an approved supplier list.  With regard to the new purchase requisitioning system, effectively what happens at present is that food is ordered locally.  The new system will mean the order is generated locally but it will be approved centrally before that order is placed.  The order will also be from an approved catalogue.  The Deputy pointed to issues in the D&oacute;chas Centre, which constitutes one 20th of our overall catering budget so we need to keep it in context.  There will be much tighter arrangements on buying from approved product lists and people will not have the ability to buy off-contract items without approval from headquarters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#F02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I want to flag that the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is introducing new green procurement and it might be something to consider in future with regard to local support for local food.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#F02300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>If the Deputy has time I will ask Mr. Black to come in on the training aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#F02400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

I was at the convention centre earlier because the Minister for Justice was before the D&aacute;il.  I am sorry for not being here for our guests' presentation.<\/p> <p>  I wish to quickly raise three issues.  The old prison in Cork has been closed and a brand new one built.  It was a very good project and well delivered.  What is the plan for the old prison?  Are plans already in place there?<\/p> <p>  I also raise the matter of healthcare costs in prisons.  I understand that quite a number of people in prison have hepatitis C.  I understand that there is a healthcare programme over 12 weeks that can leave prisoners completely clear of hepatitis C if they stick to it.  I understand the programme has now been introduced in Cork.  The product involved is also manufactured in Cork.  Are we doing enough for the healthcare of prisoners?  Some people are in prison for six months, 12 months or three years.  A 12-week programme of constant treatment can resolve an issue for them forever.<\/p> <p>  I will also touch on a matter relating to compensation and legal costs for claims.  The figures for 2018 and 2019 are set out in the report.  There were 94 claims by prison staff.  I am not sure when those claims were made.  Were they actually made in 2019 or were they finalised in that year?  There were 26 claims for criminal injuries compensation, and 175 claims arising out of injuries and other actions involving prisoners.  There were 40 claims from members of the public.  We are only given the number of claims per year in this report because it deals with the financial aspect.  Will our guests give us an idea of what numbers, on average, we are having in claims per annum from prison officers, prisoners and members of the public?  Over the next few years, are we going to have an increase in the level of compensation in this area?  Our guests might give us some details on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#H01700","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607599800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>If it is okay with the Deputy, I will take that last item first.

I do not have figures for the claims that have been made, but we will certainly send them to the committee before the end of the day.<\/p> <p>  I should say that we have quite a good engagement with the State Claims Agency, which is responsible for managing slips, trips and falls in personal injury claims.  It is also responsible for managing claims relating to slopping out.  We are doing extensive work with the agency to identify the reasons behind those claims and understand why issues are arising, and then to take the appropriate action to ensure they do not occur again.  I mentioned in my opening statement that we have had some historical claims relating to tuberculosis.  There were 99 claims relating to an outbreak in Cloverhill and 44 relating to an outbreak in Shelton Abbey.  As a result of that, we have done extensive work on infection control so that we are now in a position to keep our prisons effectively free of Covid-19.  We learn from claims and analyse their causes.

Perhaps this time around a final, single report from that office will achieve what the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service cannot.  As I said, this has been going on for years.  We are back here each year raising the same issues.  Successive Comptrollers and Auditors General have flagged up the same irregularities.  Therefore, for once and for all I would like the committee to support the recommendation that we write to the Minister requesting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121000002#L00800","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1607599800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I suggest we bring in the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has quite a bit of oversight in respect of changes and the deficiencies.

The milk issue bears out the point I have raised.  I was accused by the previous Secretary General of not having tested things in advance.  We only raise issues if people raise them with us.  The milk issue proves that it could happen, and indeed did happen in at least one instance.  Some years ago, I raised multiple instances of cross-subsidisation between prison stores and mess stores.  We have new controls now, but we have no accounts.  After our meeting in 2019, we got a list of balances of accounts and nothing more.<\/p><p> The memorandum issued by the Irish Prison Officers Association, IPOA, seeking approval for the establishment of messes states that 40% of staff spend &euro;10.61 per day.  I will quote the IPOA's figures.  The State provides &euro;1.4 million of subsidies for staff, equipment, heat, light, etc., and the system works very well.  If &euro;10.61 was spent per day by 470 staff members, a substantial amount of money would be raised every day throughout the eight prisons.  If we multiply that by 365 and then by seven we arrive at a figure of several millions.  I note that these were all cash transactions.  I join Deputy Munster in suggesting that we get an external investigator to look through those seven years' figures to ensure the milk issue was a once-off.  I hope that would be supported by the Irish Prison Service.  In case the IPOA is watching, I want to make it absolutely clear that I am totally in favour of the appropriate supports for hard-working prison officers.  Their job is a very difficult one.  There is probably an argument for them to be fed and watered free of charge given the dangers of their job.  It is not about those facilities.  It is about the appropriate oversight of many millions of euro of subsidy during that seven-year period, for which there are effectively no records. <\/p><p> Yesterday, I raised the issue of protected disclosures and the terms of reference of external investigations.

I am delighted and honoured to have been appointed Chairman.  I welcome all members of the third Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Petitions.  The committee's first task is to review its terms of reference and report to the D&aacute;il and Seanad within three months.  The committee has three main roles.  First, all petitions submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas stand referred to the committee.  Second, the committee may decide to examine matters of general public concern or interest or issues of public policy and third, the committee may consider reports of the Ombudsman.<\/p> <p>  The petitions committee has a unique role in the Parliament.  People have direct access to the Parliament using an informal process, people have a right to reply and petitions can act as a safety valve or fire alarm when reviewing public policy.  I look forward to working with all members in the genuine spirit of partnership and co-operation as we review the terms of reference and consider petitions.  We all have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in our lives, and how we conduct the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas has been altered in ways we could not have envisaged when the year began.  I trust that all members will work with me and will ensure that the committee works effectively and safely during these testing times.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is the election of a Vice Chairman but the protocol to date has been to fix a date for the election at the second meeting.

SOLAS has responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating FET in Ireland.  Through the 16 ETBs and other providers the FET system offers access to a wide range of learning opportunities and supports in every corner of the country, regardless of an individual's background or formal education level, and a learning pathway to take individuals as far as they want to go.  It currently serves a base of around 200,000 learners every year.<\/p> <p>  The year 2020 has been unprecedented and challenging for FET.  Our ways of working and ways of accessing and engaging in learning have fundamentally changed during the course of the year and it seems increasingly likely that they will results in a permanent legacy and impact even if the threat of Covid diminishes over time.  The initial changes happened virtually overnight when the first lockdown was announced in March, closing all FET facilities with immediate effect.  <\/p> <p>  The core aim across SOLAS and the ETBs was to ensure learners were protected and that they could continue to access learning and support.  This meant making online opportunities available during the period when FET facilities were closed, with swift and effective modifications to learning delivery and alternative assessment approaches put in place in accordance with quality standards.<\/p><p>The core aim across SOLAS and the ETBs was to ensure the learner was protected and they could continue to access learning and support.  This meant making online opportunities available during the period when FET facilities were closed, with swift and effective modifications to learning delivery and alternative assessment approaches put in place in accordance with quality standards; opening up eCollege, our FET online learning portal, and offering digital and other online courses free of charge to any learners who wished to avail of them; supporting the development of skills initiatives by ETBs to meet Covid-related challenges in areas like infection control and remote working; and strong continued engagement with vulnerable learners through regular telephone contact, issuing of learner packs and access to devices.  Adult guidance services also remained open via online and telephone access.<\/p><p> On funding was front-loaded to ETBs and other FET providers to sustain operations through the initial period of lockdown.  FET learners due to complete courses were guaranteed their allowances for the duration of the closure period.  As FET facilities began to reopen, additional funding of &euro;5 million was allocated to support compliance with public health requirements and &euro;5 million to facilitate access to technology by learners.<\/p><p> We have liaised on an ongoing basis with ETBs regarding their funding position and indications are that allocations have been sufficient.  Savings may even occur due to the lockdown period for FET facilities.  An &euro;8 million fund for ETBs and community education providers has also been launched in the final quarter of the year to mitigate educational disadvantage as a result of Covid.  This has all helped to support a robust strategy for the reopening of and admission to FET facilities.  Implementation guidelines were produced by Education and Training Boards Ireland in consultation with key stakeholders and they set out measures to reopen and safely deliver teaching and learning activities.  This included managing and minimising the risk of Covid in FET settings and controlling outbreaks should they occur.  In common with higher education, there was a focus on facilitating lab-based and practical learning, which cannot be delivered effectively on line, including apprenticeships.  However, there was also acknowledged meant that small-group learning in areas such as adult and community education, literacy and numeracy and youth reach could proceed on-site, given the needs of those learners.  <\/p><p> While the restrictions throughout the year have had an impact on ETB capacity to deliver FET, overall admissions across courses have remained strong and are approaching 2019 levels, while varying across different types of provision.  The moves to online flexible learning opportunities facilitated a ramp-up of workforce upskilling under Skills to Advance.  PLC admissions have held up strongly in many parts of the country, while eCollege has drawn many new learners into FET.  However, participation on apprenticeship and practical skills courses has declined due to the closure of training facilities for a period and limited capacity on reopening.<\/p><p> The crisis also created a moment of opportunity for FET.  At the beginning of 2020, we were on the cusp of launching our new five-year strategy for the system, Transforming Learning, which set out an ambitious reform agenda for the system.  FET can offer opportunities to many people with many different needs but it is currently too complex and has too many programmes.  We need to simplify pathways to ensure all learners understand they can progress within FET and into exciting jobs or higher education.  We need to make FET easier to access with clear and multiple entry points for all types of learners and learning delivered in more flexible ways, making full use of technology.  There must be a more consistent learner experience with the same levels of support and guidance on offer, regardless of course and location.  We must build a more powerful identity, developing consolidated larger scale FET colleges of the future which can help change the hearts and minds of the communities they serve. <\/p><p>The strategy is built across three pillars: building skills, fostering inclusion and facilitating pathways.  It also identifies some key enabling themes: modernisation of staffing and structures, digital transformation, a learner-centred approach and focused capital development.  Of course, there is an immediate imperative for FET to lead the upskilling response as part of the recovery and we are rolling out a skills to compete initiative to ensure those left unemployed are able to find a pathway back to sustainable work.  Under the July stimulus, we are also co-ordinating an apprenticeship incentive scheme for employers and rolling out an upskilling programme in support of the national retrofitting plan.<\/p><p> I hope this provides a brief overview of the response of the FET system to Covid-19 and the critical reform agenda it is now pursuing.  I thank the committee members for their time and look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607558400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>On behalf of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, I thank the Chair and the joint committee members for the opportunity to contribute.<\/p> <p>  CDETB has a very broad range of services including second level schools, youth services and Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, as well as delivering a large and extensive FET provision.  We run full-time courses in our FET colleges and centres and a varied range of part-time courses through those centres and also through our adult and community education services.  <\/p> <p>  When the virus hit in late February and early March, we had to move very rapidly from on-site to online delivery.  We were faced with the challenge of communicating, educating and training in a very different way.  We moved to remote delivery through email, text and phone, and to Zoom, Teams, Webex or other platforms for group communication.<\/p> <p>  The big staff challenges were availability of devices and the need to rapidly upskill in online teaching.  Initially, teachers, tutors and instructors generally used their own devices, which in many instances were shared with other family members.  Students were operating on various devices and many were merely working on their mobile phones.  Over the first few months, the ETB was only able to loan a small number of devices to very needy students.<\/p> <p>  We had to ensure that we continued to deliver education and training programmes, assessments were held, standards and quality maintained and as many students as possible could obtain their qualifications.  We worked with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and made an early decision to move from examinations to assignments where possible.  <\/p> <p>  Our student body is very diverse at FET level.  We have full-time students at levels 5 and 6 and we also have more hard-to-reach students involved in literacy and other programmes.  The learner ability to work online therefore differed greatly.  We were fortunate that teachers were already involved in technically enhanced learning and many were also already using different platforms, such as Moodle, in their teaching.  We are very happy that by late May almost all our students had gained their awards.  However, there was a difficulty in skills-based training in the apprenticeship area as remote instruction and assessment were problematic.<\/p> <p>  As we approached summer and planned for September, we concentrated on staff professional development in online teaching.  We were also involved in recruiting online and in preparing schools, colleges and centres for reopening.  Fortunately, we received grants towards minor building works, the purchase of personal protective equipment and the purchase of devices for learners.    One of the new challenges for September and October was establishing a relationship with students as we expected to be back online within a few weeks.  We were fortunate in that we were able to have person-to-person contact at the beginning of the academic year, which was positive in terms of inducting students.  Because of 2 m distancing, they did not attend every day in the normal way but they had a chance to meet each other and their teachers and tutors.  Now, at level 5, we are still seeing some students, especially those involved in practical courses or in small group activity, which is necessary to mitigate disadvantage. <\/p> <p>  We have advanced dramatically in the past eight or nine months and our use of IT in the virtual classroom or in the face-to-face classroom has been transformed.  We now have to interrogate what has happened.  We have to pick up the pieces but we also have to build on the massive advances we have made as educators.  We documented what happened from March to June in a report entitled, Informing the Future, which we are now analysing.<\/p> <p>  We are upskilling people in FET and the skills needed are constantly changing.  We are undergoing another transformation of our society.  The world of work is changing dramatically and we, as educators, have to be able to adapt and respond quickly and effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Hanney"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

The area of employer support must be examined.  There is a new action plan for apprenticeships being developed and that would be one of the core areas of focus.  It is obviously the responsibility of our parent Department, but we are closely feeding into that.  There should be more parity of esteem in terms of how employers are supported between the craft apprenticeships and some of the new apprenticeships.  At present, off-the-job training for the craft apprenticeships is fully funded by the State.  That is not the case for the new apprenticeships.  That is an area that must be looked at in the new apprenticeship action plan.<\/p> <p>  The incentive scheme has made a difference.  We were a little behind earlier in the year, approximately 40% year on year, because we could not open the training centres and run the apprenticeship programmes.  The gap is down to 20% because we are catching up and ramping up now.  The new apprenticeship registrations are now on a par with last year after catching up, but we need more action and fairness in terms of how we deal with employers.  We have made good progress in recent years, from approximately 3,000 employers taking on apprenticeships to more than 6,000, but there is a long way to go.

During the initial period of lockdown, higher education was closed for the same period.  We reopened apprenticeships in September and all the practical and laboratory-based courses that further education and training, FET, offers were up and running, but I take the Deputy's point.  We fed information into the Department, as has the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on additional capital investment, essentially to expand the capacity for apprenticeship provision during this period in which we need to catch up, but we also must expand.  That is not the only answer.  We must look at how parts of apprenticeships can be delivered online.  I do not believe it all necessarily has to be in the workshop setting.  We also must use competency assessments, where appropriate, to verify the skills of the apprentices and allow them to progress.   That is the way to do it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607558400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>To return to the first question, many of the 2,016 plus apprenticeships, the new ones such as an auctioneering apprenticeship which we started in the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, built on the relationships the education and training boards, ETBs, already had with employers.  We have extensive relationships with employers.  That is happening as well.

Mr. Brownlee attended the WorkEqual event and we appreciate that he was involved in that a month or so ago.  I recall meeting him through that.<\/p> <p>  I was on the board of the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board as a councillor for a year.  I was very surprised as a councillor and a person.  I worked in third level but I had no idea of all that ETBs do until I sat on that board and realised the width and breadth of what they do.  Funding for FET is &euro;800 million, if I understand it correctly, and there are 25,000 courses.  There is a great deal of funding going into the sector.  I remember I had many questions at the time about communication.  Obviously, people are busy doing everything, but communication is key to ensuring people are aware of what is available and especially of what the sector is doing.<\/p> <p>  My question is on communication in SOLAS and the different areas in the ETBs.  How much has been dedicated to communication to ensure engagement with career guidance counsellors in secondary schools to tell them about the courses that are available and to deal with the factor that university is not the only option and that there are other options?  There is also the issue of industry liaison with ETBs to ensure there is an immediate response to industry.  We have lost jobs in my constituency.  We were lucky recently to win jobs in Castlerea and in the medtech sector, but I come from an area where Bord na M&oacute;na just transition and retrofitting are happening.  Where is the tie-in?  I do not know the retrofitting courses that are available.  People are trying to upskill very fast, but it takes a year or two years to complete the courses.  Who are the industry liaisons in each of the ETBs and how active are they?<\/p> <p>  I will conclude with that, but I compliment the witnesses on the eCollege being opened.

How we communicate it has been a big focus for SOLAS over recent years and certainly since I became CEO in September 2019.  We have done a significant amount of work with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, the National Parents Council and the Irish Second-Level Students' Union to try to build awareness of FET and apprenticeship opportunities.  I believe we are getting a higher profile and people are starting to have those conversations when discussing post-second level choices, but there is a long way to go and it requires concerted investment.  We have to change the hearts and minds of parents, their children and the guidance counsellors.  The guidance counsellors are registered teachers and they probably come from a higher education background and pathway.  We must show them what is on offer in further education and training and apprenticeship.<\/p> <p>  There is also a job of work to be done with the schools.  We talk a great deal about school league tables and all the focus is on the CAO.  We must do more work to develop vocational options and pathways in schools, whether that is giving an apprenticeship taster in transition year programmes or delivering FET modules as part of the senior cycle, which should be a big issue to consider as the senior cycle is reviewed.  It would expose students to those vocational and technical experiences.  Some of the single-sex schools do not have the teaching capability to offer the types of technical and vocational options needed to expose a wider base of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Would the witnesses consider an ETB liaison person to deal with secondary schools in particular regions?

I would like to hear the perspectives of our witnesses on how effectively we can do that.<\/p><p> As has been said, 17.9% of the adult population is functionally illiterate.  How can educators be agents of change in that regard?   I am interested in Ms Hanney's comment on how one-to-one teaching is going to be much more advantageous in that.  There will be issues overcoming Covid related restrictions in that respect.  <\/p><p> On the issue of how Covid has affected the ability of the ETBs to deliver their services, the digital divide was mentioned.  I have spoken to a number of second level principals, who spoke about the lack of knowledge on the part of policymakers of the digital divide.  It is not about access to broadband; it is about access to devices that can be utilised.  A principal told me that 60% of her student body could only access the work through their smartphones.  <\/p><p> I have some more general questions.  What have we learned from this period?  As is often said, a good crisis should not be wasted.  I worry that we will move beyond this crisis, feel that we have survived this period and look to the future, hoping that things will go back to exactly where they were previously.  We all have a responsibility to learn from the deficiencies that have been exposed by this health crisis.  Lessons were learned from the financial crisis a number of years ago, and structures were put in place.  I hope the same will happen across education.<\/p><p> The issue of funding has been mentioned by the witnesses and I take those comments on board.  Do they believe there is something deeper, more profound and more structural that the education system can react to in learning from what Covid has exposed?  If so, what would that be?  We are all collectively trying to empower everybody in this country to maximise their capabilities, and the services provided by the organisations represented here today are key to that.  I have a profound worry that, as with the financial crash, there is a feeling that things would be great if we could only get back to the good times.  However, for many people working in education and society, and for those I have mentioned with lower literacy levels, things were not so great before.  What can we learn from this experience to ensure that if we ever face this issue again, we will be in a much better position to survive it, and so that the education sector can thrive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#D02200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607558400,"counter":528,"content":"<p>On the issue of literacy, people with literacy difficulties are very often hard to reach.

We also reach people through English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, courses.  During the crisis, this was probably an area in which it was more difficult to reach people.  That highlights how important it is that people have access to some forms of digital literacy.  There is the issue of training people.  As the Deputy said, it is not just about the devices; it is also about people being able to use the devices.  That is one of the challenges in our modern society.<\/p> <p>  On what we learned during the crisis, we learned that it is surprising what people can do when they have to do it.  Teachers were telephoning and emailing people. Often they were just telephoning people, talking to them and talking them through their crises.  Those with literacy difficulties often have other difficulties and coming back to deal with those difficulties is quite a challenge for them.  We learned a great deal during the crisis.  We advanced in our own digital literacy as educators and we learned that we can do much more online than we thought could do.

The findings of that research were very interesting.  We found that there is absolutely no replacement for face-to-face learning and people definitely want that.  We also found that even people working at the lowest levels on the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, are interested in doing part of their courses online.

People will have five or six jobs in their lifetime, and nobody will go into a job and stay there for the rest of their life.  Industry has been telling us that we need to facilitate people to develop a range of skills, including good communication skills - both written and oral - and digital skills, and also transferable or transversal skills like decision-making and problem-solving.  We have been trying to build the development and acquisition of those skills into our courses.  The FET colleges are very well placed to do that because we operate in very small learner groups.

As the Deputy alluded to, the key to this development is employers.  There cannot be an apprentice without an employer who is willing to take on that apprentice.  The number of employers engaging in the scheme has gone from 3,000 to over 6,000 in the last few years, but we need to go much further.  It needs to be part of the normal business practice across a much wider range of employers.  We need greater parity of esteem in respect of funding the off-the-job costs for new apprenticeships as well as the craft apprenticeships.  Funding for these costs is available for the craft apprenticeships at the moment.  We need to look at incentivisation schemes.<\/p> <p>  On how the incentive scheme works, it works very simply, which is part of the beauty of the concept.  Essentially, the scheme provides an employer with &euro;2,000 for taking on an apprentice and if the apprentice is kept on for a year, the employer gets a further &euro;1,000.

One, as we said earlier, is that we are trying to get additional capacity in our training centres so we can take on additional numbers.  We must keep to social distancing requirements and so on, which is a constraint.  The second aspect is that we are trying to move some of the apprenticeships' curriculums online.

We are introducing competency-based assessments to allow them to progress at a faster rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brownlee.

This is to mitigate disadvantage, and there are some students who want to come into the buildings because they do not have the facilities at home.  Our different colleges are addressing that in different ways, depending on their student body and the size of rooms.  If a room is bigger, one can fit more people in.  In most of our colleges we are trying to have face-to-face contact with students at some stage, perhaps once a week.

It is much appreciated.  My first question is for the City of Dublin Education and Training Board and for Education and Training Boards Ireland.  The ETBs are responsible for youth work and it seems to me that the pandemic has been especially challenging for young people.  Social outlets are closed down and even the schools were closed down for extended periods.  Part-time employment opportunities are not available.  It is really profound.  At the same time that was happening a lot of youth work had to be restricted.  To be fair, this has recently scaled up significantly and I am aware that ambitious plans for expansion at the Cork ETB have continued.  Will the witnesses comment on the challenges presenting in the youth work sector?  I believe it is very important at this time.<\/p> <p>  My next question for SOLAS and the ETBs is around the back to education allowance.  In my experience, the payment is restrictive because it requires the person to have been unemployed for a certain period of time.  This requirement prevents people on low incomes, in short-term unemployment or in underemployment from accessing training courses and apprenticeships or from choosing a new trade.  I would like to have a comment on that.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for SOLAS on a point I brought up with the Minister, Deputy Harris, recently.  The picture is quite varied but there are some publicly funded bodies that have not really engaged as they should in terms of taking on apprentices.  I will not get into naming any of them, but while some universities and public bodies take on apprentices to develop skills, there are others that do not.  I believe the local authorities have improved a bit in that regard.  There is huge scope there now and especially as employment within local authorities and public bodies expands.<\/p> <p>  I hope that Mr. Brownlee of SOLAS will not mind me being a little parochial, and I brought up this point with the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins also.  Some years ago the painting facilities in Cork were closed and one cannot now do a painters' apprenticeship in Cork.  Anecdotally, I am aware there is demand.  I was stopped not terribly long ago by a man in Blackpool Shopping Centre whose daughter wanted to do a painting apprenticeship and who was not keen on travelling to Dublin for it.  This also affects Kerry, Waterford and the surrounding areas.  It is not just about the traditional painting skills; there are also the decorative painting skills for restoration, heritage and marbling and gilding.  It also has implications for people who might want to work in building sets for the theatre and film industry.  We will always need painters.  It is a durable trade and adaptable for a wide range of arenas.  Will Mr. Brownlee go back and engage with the Cork ETB and with the people who had previously provided the courses to see if they can be re-established in Cork?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#F01100","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607558400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I will take question on youth services.  Yes, we fund youth services in the city of Dublin.  It has been very challenging for youth services because in the first lockdown the youth services were making every effort they could to try to keep in contact with young people.  Again, a lot of the contact was on phones, but they are now going back to delivering a service that is more like what they delivered before.  It is, however, quite curtailed.<\/p><p> Another aspect of the youth services involves training young people in how to deal with a crisis, wearing their masks and so on, so it plays a very important part.  We have also been linking our second level schools with the youth services in order that they can work together.  We ran an infection prevention and control course through one of our colleges, Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;de, and we offered that to our youth service personnel to allow them to upskill in that area.<\/p><p> On the back to education allowance, we do not have a say as to who gets it.  There are other options.  If people cannot get the allowance, we steer them towards courses on the vocational training opportunities scheme, other grants that may be available, for example, SUSI grants, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Hanney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607558400,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the back-to-education initiative.  The Deputy makes a fair point.  We are evaluating the initiative at the moment in conjunction with Indecon, which is carrying out an independent evaluation.  It is important that we feed in those types of views.  We are finding that it is a problem at present with the PUP because there is a massive base of, hopefully short-term, unemployed people who might benefit from reskilling and upskilling.  Ensuring that they are eligible for focused, longer-term or maybe even full-time education and training is an issue we need to look at in the context of the back-to-education initiative.<\/p> <p>  I agree with regard to trying to open up apprenticeships to a much wider base of public sector bodies.  There is mention of that in the consultation document in the context of the development of the action plan on apprenticeships.  We have worked with different parts of the public sector to try to embed it but I totally agree with the Deputy and we will ramp up our work on that.  We will engage with Cork ETB on the painting apprenticeship.  There is a real issue with the wet trades.  The appeal of a four-year apprenticeship programme in those types of trades seems to have diminished, maybe because they are not as regulated as some of the other areas like electrical apprenticeships, and so painters can almost move into more informal training arrangements for their staff.  There is definitely an issue around the wet trades.  I will raise it with Cork ETB but we do need to do something, perhaps around the future length of apprenticeships or how we deliver them to try to make inroads into trades like painting and decorating in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I will make a brief point and I do not require a response to it.

As a qualified youth worker, I believe youth work is a different form of education and it can give young people the tools to keep themselves and others around them safe.  During this pandemic, young people have been getting much of the blame for spreading the virus so I echo the point about how important it is to educate our young people.  I came through the ETB system and I am a graduate of Ballyfermot College of Higher Education.  I studied pre-nursing and absolutely loved it.  As a Traveller woman, it gave me that sense of belonging.  In Ballyfermot college there were people who were deaf or visually impaired and who had extra supports like note-takers and interpreters.  This is the most important question I have.  We are talking about literacy skills and people who cannot even get access to the college because of their literacy skills but there are also people in college who are blind or deaf and who need that intense learning support while in the class.  As a student who came through it I know what it is like and it is the loveliest atmosphere in the world.  How are those adults and young people getting through the system in the middle of this pandemic?<\/p> <p>  People using their mobile phones was mentioned.  Has the ETB spoken to students who have been using their mobile phones over the past number of weeks and months?  What was that impact for those young people?  We also spoke about the digital divide.  What kind of an impact has that had on students?  A few weeks ago, young people in the ETB in Donegal did not have access to do their courses online and were not allowed to do them online.  I am bringing that issue up here today.  It is a requirement that universities do their courses online but it is not even an option in some cases for students in the ETB.  What measures need to be put in place so that people can have the option to do online learning within the ETB?<\/p> <p>  Our ETBs and further education institutions should be treated with equal respect to our universities.  From my own personal experience, I know how valuable they are in society, and for young Traveller men especially because they create apprenticeships.  I have worked around the table with the ETB.  I give the witnesses credit for the work they have done to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#G00500","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607558400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>The Senator mentioned young people.  Young people are afraid.  They are not all out partying.

We are funded to help people who have disabilities, who use sign language, etc.  During Covid, some people with disabilities were affected more than others, depending on what their disabilities were.  It was probably not as serious for those with physical disabilities, as long as they were not sight-related or something.  They had different experiences but in all our colleges and centres we would have kept up very close contact by phone and so on with them.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about young people using their phones.  They are used to using their phones but we discovered that they did not know how to do a lot of things on their phones and we had to teach them that as well.  There is a digital divide in society for young people and also older people, particularly for our community in adult education.  Older people suffer very much in that area as well because they do not use IT at work.  We are dealing with those people as well.

I do not necessarily want to repeat what has been said, but I wish to focus on two matters.  The question of literacy has been mentioned.  Last year, I met Ms Helen Ryan of the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA.  I was shocked by some of the statistics on literacy that she presented to us.  For example, Ireland is ranked 17th out of 24 countries for literacy and 18th for numeracy.  One in six adults has problems reading and understanding everyday items such as bus timetables and medical prescriptions.  Without doubt, low literacy rates cost and strong literacy rates pay.  The cost of low literacy levels to the individual, communities and society is significant.  We should see this as a priority.  Literacy promotes equality.  When I speak about literacy and numeracy, I also mean digital literacy.  Recent months - it has been nearly a year now that I think about it - have proven that.<\/p> <p>  I would be interested in knowing the witnesses' thoughts on how we can help narrow the gap.  Their organisations are in a unique position to work with bodies like NALA.  In terms of social exclusion and inequality, this is the main issue.  I was a primary school teacher in a disadvantaged area many years ago and ensuring literacy was the main element I tried to get right.  That 18% of adults are lacking literacy skills is shocking in a country that prides itself on its education.  I would be interested in knowing what support we could provide.<\/p> <p>  It is not surprising that fewer people have opted for apprentices in recent months, but it is a concern because the numbers were low beforehand.  This was due to a lack of parity of esteem between university learning and earn-as-you-learn apprenticeships.  Two years ago, only 2% of people taking up apprenticeships were women.  Last year, that increased to 4%.  How do we address that?<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about the return to campuses.  My nephew started in the University of Limerick this year.  He was lucky that his course required him to be on campus for part of it.  Students could engage with one another in the learning curve, albeit in limited ways.  Two young guys in the flat beneath his are doing the same course and they find that working together in a group is beneficial and helpful, even when much of the work is done online.  Trying to allow a return is important.<\/p> <p>  My final point is one I make whenever I have the opportunity.  It relates to people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, accessing further and higher education.  It is important and we need to do everything possible to ensure everyone has that opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#H00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to give the witnesses an opportunity to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#H00500","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>That is it from me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020121000002#H00600","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607558400,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I will lead with the questions regarding the approach at national level.  There is work to be done under the ten-year strategy on literacy and numeracy, including digital literacy.  That the Senator mentioned NALA was important.  It does fantastic work and made available a large amount of online and telephone resources during the summer to keep people engaged.  The ETBs also do fantastic work, but none of this will solve the literacy problem.  As part of the new strategy, we need a cross-government, cross-society and cross-economy approach that involves libraries, healthcare, childcare, local authorities and digital broadband.  Such an approach has been missing.<\/p> <p>  For apprenticeships, parity of esteem is critical.  We need to take three actions, the first of which is embedding vocational pathways in second level schools.  This means transition year taster programmes and modules from further education and training, FET, colleges being part of the senior cycle.  Obviously, there is a great deal of work to be done in terms of guidance and convincing parents.  We need to examine the CAO decision point and the question of how to get apprenticeships and FET on the table when parents are talking to their kids about options, given that the CAO process is wholly focused on going to a university or institute of technology.<\/p> <p>  Access for people with intellectual disabilities is an important priority.

We have had many contributors from the education side in recent weeks, but it strikes me that we are getting into particularly important territory with the witnesses' presence today.  We are discussing an area where issues of disadvantage most arise and the importance of practical skill-based education.  These are the areas where on-site education is crucial and online education can be much more challenging.<\/p> <p>  I will first ask an overview-type question.  What are the lessons of this time for the post-pandemic world?  We see the importance of online education, but is it not fair to say that we are also seeing its limitations in a significant way?  Are the limitations of online education likely to stay with us?  Are there bridges that we just cannot cross?  I have often stated that the concept of blended learning has been something of a pill-sweetening phrase because it masks the reality that, in many cases, there is no on-site learning at all in colleges and that the experience has limitations.  I would be grateful to get the witnesses' overview thoughts on this matter.<\/p><p>On the subject of apprenticeships, I am conscious that when I worked in the former Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, which is now part of TU Dublin, I saw the great contribution of apprenticeship within the college.  I refer to the remarks of Deputy Nolan.  I remember being in County Kerry and meeting journeymen from Europe.  They were young, newly qualified apprentices wearing very elaborate costumes.  They were spending several years going around having completed their training.  The practice goes back to medieval times.  It struck me that there was a pride in their craft and their trade which was reflected in that tradition.  Although I am very much among those who welcome the advent of technological universities, is there something missing in the way we approach and regard apprenticeships?  Has the tendency to move to degrees and the university label for everything caused a problem that needs to be addressed?  Sin ceist eile.  <\/p><p> To return to the issue of online learning and on the subject of SOLAS and the FET online learning portal, is there potential in that?  Are there things that have been learned through it from which other participants or the Department of Education itself can benefit?

We stressed from day one that during restrictions, even level 5 restrictions, disadvantaged students must still be allowed come in to some extent in order to be supported in small, socially distanced groups and that practical skills training still has to be delivered on site.  We got support for that approach.  It is really important.  It taught us that even with those types of offerings, there are opportunities to blend on-site learning with smaller, bite-size portions of online learning.  That is part of the overall learning on this issue.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether lessons have been learned for the wider education sector.  I think the real opportunity here is to get away from the idea that education is something one does between the ages of 17 and 21 and it takes one into a job and one never needs to worry about it again.  We need to use much more online flexible provision to make lifelong learning something with which people engage throughout their lifetimes and careers.  We will need to continually upskill and reskill to meet the needs of the future world of work.  That is the change and the opportunity we now have, partly as a result of Covid.  We have seen what is possible.  As the Senator noted, not everything is possible, but if we can break what we offer down into more accessible, bite-size chunks and offer it through models such as e-college, we will be able to get to everyone and create the kind of society and economy that we wish to have.  That is the real lesson there.  I do not believe that 67% of school-leavers going into higher education is the right balance for any kind of modern economy.  We need more of those people to choose to go into apprenticeship and further education and training.

In the first part, we are very pleased to meet H.E. George Zurabashvilli, ambassador of the Republic of Georgia, to discuss the occupation of regions of Georgia and the EU accession process.  He is very welcome.  This is the first time Mr. Zurabashvilli has attended in his capacity as ambassador.  On previous occasions on which we met and on which he was present, it was in his capacity as senior official or charg&eacute; d'affaires.  Today, he comes fully fledged as ambassador of the Republic of Georgia.  In that regard, he is most welcome.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will hear an opening statement from the ambassador before proceeding to questions and answers with members of the committee, some of whom are present with us in the committee room and some of whom we expect to join us on Zoom or Teams.  I am in the hands of members as to how we proceed.  I am very keen that everybody will have the opportunity to ask questions.  What we could do is allocate five minutes to each member or just proceed as we have in the past, but asking members to address questions.  We will see how we get along.<\/p> <p>  Before proceeding to the business of the meeting, I remind members that mobile phones should be switched off completely or put on aeroplane mode for the duration of the meeting because they are likely to cause interference with the recording equipment in our rooms, even when in silent mode.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or body outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action taken based on what they say at the meeting.  However, it is expected that nobody will abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure it is in no way abused.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed by me to discontinue such discourse.  It is imperative that these directions be complied with, which I know they will be.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador and his official are very welcome.

It is a great honour and privilege to be invited to this historic building, Leinster House, by the respected committee to represent my country and to brief members on the challenges Georgia has and the ongoing Russian occupation, and also to share the progress Georgia has been successfully achieving towards further European Union integration, as well as to mark out the excellent bilateral relations between our countries.  I am conscious that this is the first opportunity I have had to address members since the respected committee was selected.  Moreover, since Ireland has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations, I would sincerely like to congratulate it.<br\/><br\/>Georgia&rsquo;s stated aspirations to European and Euro-Atlantic integration, as well as its rigid democratic and economic growth, have further solidified Russia&rsquo;s aggression against a sovereign neighbour, with the main intention being to keep Georgia under its direct political influence and domination.  It is important to emphasise that the conflict in the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions of Georgia is not an internal rebellion or a civil war, but a co-ordinated attack fomented, planned and carried out by the Russian Federation.  Russia&rsquo;s military forces and units and Russian citizens directly participate in the military operations, using Russian military equipment.  The plans to storm and occupy Georgian regions were drawn up and approved in Moscow.  Faced with well-trained and well-equipped military units of Russia, Georgia lost <i>de facto<\/i>control over the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions.  As a result of Russian military aggression, illegal proxy regimes were created by Russia in both the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions of Georgia.<br\/><br\/>Throughout almost 30 years of the Russia&ndash;Georgia conflict from 1991 to the current day, the ethnic Georgian population has been subjected to atrocities, including mass murder, torture, rape and pillage.  The Georgian nation has suffered through three massive waves of ethnic cleansing in both the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions of Georgia, which has resulted in 500,000 internally displaced persons, IDPs, and refugees, for which the Russian Federation is responsible.  During the August 2008 war, Russia conducted a large-scale military attack against sovereign Georgia on land, at sea, by air and via cyberspace.  As a result, Russia has additionally occupied 125 villages and has burnt out, destroyed and flattened the houses of 35,000 Georgians in order to preclude any return of the expelled population, trying to change the traces of history and pretending Georgians never lived here.  Those few who have escaped atrocities and have remained in the Tskhinvali and Abkhazia regions are constantly subject to massive human rights violations.<br\/><br\/>In April 2011, the Russian occupation forces started the installation of barbed wire fences and other artificial obstacles along the occupation line in the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions of Georgia.  This process of borderisation has further intensified and actively continues now.  The length of barbed wire fences and barriers along the occupation line in the occupied Abkhazia region exceeds 49 km, and in the Tskhinvali region it exceeds 52 km.  As a result, the local population is cut off from agricultural and grazing lands, potable and irrigation water systems, and churches and cemeteries.  Residing on different sides of the occupation line, more than 800 families are denied contact with each other.  Those few ethnic Georgians who are left beyond the occupation line are deprived of fundamental human rights, including free movement, civil rights, property rights, education rights in the native Georgian language, health services and so on.<\/p><p>The native Georgians are forced to take Russian passports or register as foreigners.  They are forced to change Georgian names and surnames.  Almost all original Georgian toponymic names of cities, villages and streets are also changed.  We witness frequent cases of illegal kidnapping, detention, torture and murder of those who live along the occupation line.  The brutality of such actions is beyond human nature.<\/p><p> Russian occupation forces continuously move the occupation line deeper into the country, seizing thousands of acres of Georgian lands, advancing closer to the vitally important east-west highway, grabbing territories where crucial pipelines carry oil and gas to the EU markets.  The creeping occupation brings fear to the local population, destruction to the economy and undermines security.  Currently, 20% of Georgian territory is occupied by the Russians.<\/p><p> The Russian Federation refuses to fulfil its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement that was mediated by the European Union under the French Presidency.  The six-point agreement envisages the non-use of force, which Georgia has signed unilaterally as Russia declines to meet this obligation.  Georgia calls for withdrawal of the Russian troops from our territories as stated in the same agreement.  Instead, Russia has built two illegal military bases in both occupied regions where more than 10,000 Russian military and security personnel are stationed.  In addition, Russia maintains 2,600 KGB or FSB agents and border guards to control the occupation line and adjacent territories.  The Russian illegal military bases are well equipped with modern military hardware, including tanks, artillery, military drones and ballistic missiles with the capability of wearing conventional and nuclear warheads.  Russia&rsquo;s Black Sea naval fleet is in constant movement in the Abkhaz section of Georgia&rsquo;s territorial waters, while military planes of Russia&rsquo;s air force constantly violate the airspace of both regions.  The permanent military drills conducted by Russia on the occupied territories constitutes further threat to local and regional security.<\/p><p> We remember well the visit to Georgia in November 2008 by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and now Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  We remain immensely grateful to the Irish Government and the European Union for launching the European Union monitoring mission, the non-military observers&rsquo; mission, with eight Irish serving on the ground in Georgia, observing the occupation line.  However, again, the Russian Federation breached the ceasefire agreement mediated by the EU and does not allow the EU monitoring mission to cross the occupation line to carry out its mandate fully.  Even worse, a few months ago the occupation regime kidnapped and detained one of the international observers.<\/p><p> Russia is continuing to violate the basic principles of international law through the legitimisation of forced territorial and demographic changes through occupation and ethnic cleansing and recognising the so-called independence of the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions of Georgia.  Furthermore, through political and financial pressure, Russia forces others to do so, as Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru and, most recently, the Assad regime in Syria did.<\/p><p> The Russian Federation continues the illegal process of de facto annexation of these regions through signing so-called treaties on alliance and integration with the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali occupation regimes, thus fully incorporating Georgia's occupied regions into Russia's military, political, economic, social and legal systems.  A few weeks ago, the Russian President announced the creation of a common socioeconomic and defence space with the occupied Abkhazia region of Georgia.<\/p><p> Through these destabilizing steps, in an attempt to change sovereign borders in Europe, the Russian Federation poses a serious threat to peace and security on the European Continent.  It is of crucial necessity that the international community does not turn a blind eye to the alarming processes the Russian Federation is carrying out through de facto annexation of Georgia's occupied territories and projecting power in the wider Black Sea region and the southern Caucasus.<\/p><p> Georgia remains firmly committed to the peaceful resolution of the conflict and de-escalation of tensions with Russia based on respect of Georgia&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it has undertaken concrete steps by adopting A Step to a Better Future, the peaceful integration programme for both regions.<\/p><p> The response of the European Union as a guarantor of the ceasefire agreement needs to be stronger, more decisive and resolute in defending the principles of respecting the agreement, and it needs to call on Russia to implement its obligations under the EU-mediated 2008 ceasefire agreement, cease its illegal steps towards de facto annexation of Georgia&rsquo;s occupied territories and withdraw its military forces from Georgian soil.<\/p><p> We appeal to our international partners and allies to demonstrate a firm stance, make strong public statements and take actions in the respective capitals to give due assessment to the illegal developments I have mentioned.  The European Union and the international community should make Russia accountable to international law, because in the modern world the rule of law must govern and justice must prevail.<\/p><p> We are grateful to the Irish Government and to the Oireachtas for supporting Georgia&rsquo;s territorial integrity, for co-sponsoring multiple UN resolutions on the safe and dignified return of internally displaced persons to their true homes, and for the motions passed in Oireachtas, as I anticipate seeing other resolutions on Georgia&rsquo;s territorial integrity and EU membership as a reiteration of Ireland's continued support.<\/p><p> Today, in speaking to the committee and in speaking to Ireland as a friendly nation, a fully fledged EU member state and a newly elected non-permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations, I remain confident that the occupation Georgia faces and the crimes against humanity that Georgians suffer because of the devastating policy of the Russian Federation will be strongly condemned, efficiently tackled and the actions towards de-occupation will be executed.  We are not living in a perfect world but definitely we together can make it more human, more secure and better protected.<\/p><p> In parallel, the country is progressing well towards European Union integration.  Strong leadership of the Government based on the nation&rsquo;s destiny towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration, which is firmly reflected in our constitution, will achieve our success.  The Georgian Government has declared it will submit an EU membership application by 2024.<\/p><p> European values are exactly what determine Georgia's European path.  We Georgians share exactly the same values as the EU does and our shared past is an integral part of our shared future.  Therefore, we are confident that only by embracing political and economic interdependence can we both progress and develop further.<\/p><p> Dreams do not work unless we do.  In terms of the eastern partnership, we have signed an association agreement with the European Union that opens a new chapter in Georgia's relations with the EU.  In this direction, our next goal is to join the Single Market, the single euro payment area and the single telecommunications space, and incorporate into educational domains, the transportation network and many more.<\/p><p> Since the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement signed with the European Union, the EU has become the major trade partner for Georgia, with a 12% increase in our trade balance sheet.  Georgia invites Irish businesses to enjoy our favourable location, which is a gateway from Europe to Asia, as we provide free market access to a population market of more than 2 billion through free trade with China, including Hong Kong, central Asia and all neighbouring countries.<\/p><p> Avoidance of double taxation is another strong incentive for Irish companies.  The competitive advantage of Georgia is based on the rule of law, with a liberal market economy and well-regulated property rights, an easy, friendly and corruption-free business environment and a skilled and cheap labour force.  The phenomenal progress Georgia has achieved in the past decade comes through the elementary tax code system designed by the Government to ease business conditions.  Georgia is ranked seventh in the world in the World Bank ease of doing business index and it is ranked fifth on economic freedom by the Fraser Institute.<\/p><p> Georgia possesses huge potential in green hydropower generation.  We are studying closely the project to construct a novel Black Sea underwater electricity transmission line to supply the EU with much-needed green energy.<\/p><p>In a world of digitisation, Internet cables stretching along the seabed are among the top priorities, as the Black Sea has turned out to be a sea of connectivity.<\/p><p> Georgia contributes to global security and participates in all counterterrorism operations led by the United States and in various EU peacekeeping missions.  Although EU membership is not currently on the table, it is our goal that Georgia will become a member of the European Union.  We call on the EU to further shape co-operation with Georgia as a potential candidate country.  Being defined as a potential candidate country will be a sign of great support to Georgia's democracy and will certainly further consolidate Georgia's democratic and economic reforms.<\/p><p> Nowadays, the increasing bilateral relations require reciprocation by the Irish Government to open an Irish embassy in Tbilisi, which will definitely contribute to the Irish global footprint policy.  It will also benefit Ireland as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, open new horizons for Irish businesses and contribute to our bilateral relations.<\/p><p> Our friendship is strong and firm, while the relations are sincere, reliable and trusting.  We commit insofar as we can to support Ireland in whatever it needs and whenever it asks, on the international arena and in all multilateral formats of our competence.  We remain more connected, more interactive and more relevant than ever before.<\/p><p> I thank members of the committee and invite them to ask any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It is pleasant to be here among friends.  To respond to Deputy Clarke, I, too, recall our Zoom call, in which we had a substantial discussion.  Regarding the creeping border and the creeping annexation and occupation that Russia is conducting as we speak, it is grabbing more and more land.  The problem is that Russia is not only not withdrawing troops from Georgian soil but adding more and more.  With the creeping annexation, Russia is instilling more fear in the local population and, of course, it results in more torture and murder.  We have a strong aspiration to become a NATO member, with the support of 76% of the Georgian population.  According to surveys, Georgians very much support European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.<\/p> <p>  We see NATO not only as a good defender for ourselves but also as a way to approximate our standards to NATO standards.  Our military already co-operates well with NATO headquarters.  As I noted, we participated in almost all US-led and NATO-led counterterrorism operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  There are some examples of countries that have become NATO members later having problems, such as Germany, but that should not be a problem for us.  We strongly believe this is the right direction for the further progress of the country.  NATO concerns not only military; it is a strong democracy with many other requirements to secure membership, which we are fulfilling quite well and on which we are making progress.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady is absolutely correct to say resolutions sometimes do not work, but what else do we have?  They are a tool to be vocal and to make Russia accountable to international law.  We are talking about being accountable to international law and to fulfilling obligations once a country has signed a resolution.  We very much look forward to hearing the voice of Ireland, as a future non-permanent member, on the UN Security Council.<\/p><p>We very much look forward to and hope there will be many initiations coming out from Ireland on Georgia's behalf to support us in the United Nations.<\/p><p> Our bilateral relations are quite strong.  I would like to see business and economy develop further.  This is the most important element that can cement any strong political relations we already have.  We would love to see more Irish businesses and more investments from Ireland go to Georgia.  Again, we are offering our soil, our land and our markets for Irish businesses.  We hope they will take up this idea and enjoy doing business in or with Georgia.<\/p><p> It is always nice to have sports events like rugby and soccer.  We will have many other enjoyable matches and games ahead.  We are doing quite well but we are still not members of the Six Nations.  We are struggling to become the seventh member.  We were here several times at the Aviva Stadium and we were too polite to win.  I hope our skills will get better.  Rugby and soccer are very popular in Georgia.  All my friends are great fans.  It is similar to here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

What are the ambassador's views on that?<\/p> <p>  With the port in Batumi, there are opportunities for import and export right across the globe.<\/p> <p>  When I was in Batumi, there were several questions about Georgia meeting the rule of law for accession to the European Union, particularly to stamp out corruption of any sort.

In both cases, Mr. Zurabashvili is not the first ambassador to tell this committee about resolutions from the United Nations.

Education is one of the main aspects about which any nation has to care.  We are part of the Erasmus+ programme and one of the most active countries in it.  If one goes to the statistics, more than 5,000 Georgians students enjoy the Erasmus+ programme.  Some Georgians also travel to Ireland for the good education provided here.  We are also part of other educational programmes of the European Union.  As part of our next goal as an associate country of the European Union, we very much look forward to becoming part of the educational domains of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  The Georgian language is a source of great pride for us.  At the same time, it is a bit local.  We have to study other languages.  The other language is English.  It is obligatory from the first grade in school.  That is why the young generation is fluent in the English language.  They realise that if one wants to achieve something globally, one has to speak and know English well.<\/p> <p>  The reforms that the Georgian Government is fulfilling will take time and are painful for the population.  We understand that to have a bright future, one, sometimes, must struggle today.  We are proud of the anti-corruption measures that we are doing quite well.  For instance, according to the corruption percentage index of 2019, Transparency International ranked Georgia 44 among 180 countries.  It should not be forgotten that 30 years ago Georgia was part of the Soviet Union which was totally based on corruption.  It is a huge progress for us.  At the same time, we are listed as No. 1 in the absence of corruption category in Eastern Europe and Central Asia in the Rule of Law Index 2020 surveyed by the World Justice Project.  We are doing well.  There are many other things that need to be tackled but we are on the right path.<\/p> <p>  Regarding UN resolutions, the Senator is correct that they do not bring results.  We do not know any other terms beside the resolutions, however.<\/p><p>At the same time, those resolutions are very helpful.  They bring results.  Whenever the resolutions are straightforward, vocal and firm, they will definitely bring results.  I am grateful to the Oireachtas for the several resolutions that have been passed in Leinster House.  I anticipate more and more because this is the only job we can do together here.<\/p><p> Deputy Brady asked a question on the economy.  The Georgian economy was not doing badly before the pandemic.  The country's GDP growth before the pandemic was 5%, which is a good figure for us or for any country.  Our economy is not as big or wealthy as Ireland's but it is very diversified, which keeps us resilient to the turmoil that happens in the world economy.  Everybody suffers in a pandemic and the Georgian economy has suffered a lot.  We will probably have negative growth by the end of this year.  I cannot yet give any figure but we do not anticipate anything good.  However, I saw yesterday in the Georgian press that the National Bank of Georgia is predicting growth of approximately 4.5% in 2021.  If that happens, it will be a very successful year for us, after the pandemic.  Of course, it depends on the epidemiological situation and the vaccination process and not only in Georgia because we are interconnected with our immediate neighbourhood and with the whole world.  We hope the vaccination process will progress well so as to allow the interlinked economies to take another breath and jump forward.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanton mentioned hydropower and hydroelectricity.  Georgia is a mountainous country and our permanent glaciers mean we have streams and rivers full of water.  We use hydropower plants for 85% of our power generation so we can say that almost all electricity generation is green in Georgia.  We import whatever we need but our own generation is hydropower.  In the summer, we export electricity to neighbouring countries.  We have constructed a high-voltage grid to connect us with Turkey for the importation and exportation of electricity.  We have others with Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.  We are thinking about constructing an underwater electricity cable link to the European Union to enable us to export green energy to the EU.  The Black Sea has become the sea of connectivity.  The Black Sea is not as big as it used to be in old times.  Its length is about 1,100 km.  It is not that long and can be crossed in a two-hour flight.  It is very much possible and we are considering this opportunity.  <\/p><p> I think I missed one of the topics that were raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"H.

According to the most recent census, there are 3.8 million Georgians living in Georgia.  Emigration is a global process that occurs everywhere.  Georgians have been travelling since the borders opened after the collapse of the USSR.  That is when Georgian emigration started.  There was some previously when the Bolsheviks captured and occupied Georgia.  When the Iron Curtain was in place, we were not allowed to travel abroad.  The most recent wave of Georgian emigration started 30 years ago.  People are travelling for a better life and better salaries.  The economy leads their decision.  At the same time, Georgians are family-based people.  We always anticipate that one day we will return.  I think the Irish will not be surprised to hear this given that 70 million people of Irish extraction live abroad and 5.5 million people live in the country.<\/p> <p>  We realise that sometimes undocumented immigration brings problems to the host countries.  We implement many activities and have invented new mechanisms to prevent illegal or undocumented travel.  We have had some success.  European Union statistics show a huge decline in the number of people who have travelled undocumented.  That is part of life but, at the same time, we are doing the best we can and we co-operate closely with Europol, Eurojust and Frontex to prevent and avoid illegal travel.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Berry asked a question on Georgia's application to join the EU in 2024.  That is what we have declared.  How long it will take to become a member, God knows.  It is a long process.  At the same time, we are not chasing the process.  We are saying EU membership would be good for Georgia.  Whenever it happens, it happens.  It will be whenever the EU is ready to open its borders to new members and enlargement.  Ireland supports the enlargement process but there are different ideas.  We are not pushing anybody.  We are doing our homework and when the time comes, we will be ready.<\/p> <p>  On cyberattacks, we suffer from such attacks.  It was not only in 2008 because since that time there have been several attacks coming from Russia.  We had close co-operation with the law enforcement bodies of our ally countries, such as the UK and the US.  This helps us to identify the source of these attacks.  We know what happened and when it happened.  We are not the only country to have suffered cyberattacks from Russia.

The ambassador does an excellent job representing his country and I thank him for his presentation. <\/p><p> I wear two hats as I am the convenor of the Oireachtas Georgian Friendship Group and a member of this committee.  Therefore, I believe we should wholeheartedly support the ambassador's call for the Irish Government to open an embassy in Tbilisi in Georgia.  I agree an embassy would be an important step in the expansion of the Irish global footprint.  Indeed, perhaps we could use the experience of the Chairman and his good offices to assist us in expediting that objective, as soon as possible.<\/p><p> On annexation by Russia, the ambassador mentioned that 20% of the Georgian territory is occupied and in the region of 125 villages are occupied.  Can he elaborate on what he meant by the term \"continuous annexation\"?  He mentioned it in reply to a question by Deputy Brady but I am interested to hear more about the issue. <\/p><p> I am very impressed by the figures on the Georgian economy over the last number of years.  Like Senator Craughwell, I was fortunate to visit Georgia so I can attest to the fact that it is a very progressive country and I take this opportunity to wish Georgia well in its application to join the European Union.  <\/p><p> In terms of something that Deputy Berry mentioned, as part of the visit to Georgia the delegation visited the EU monitoring group.  I am glad to say that the Irish are very well represented in that group by members of the Defence Forces and it is something that we can be proud of.  Does the mission still exist and continue the good work that it did a number of years ago?<\/p><p> The ambassador mentioned the avoidance of double taxation in Georgia and the huge opportunities that presents for companies.  We are primarily interested in Irish companies establishing there as they would have access to a market worth over &euro;2 billion.  Ireland, as a country, should seriously consider that market and maybe another committee might also pursue this issue.

Are there lessons to be learned from the failure of EU institutions to intervene in the conflict as we take our seat at the European Council?

I have had the privilege of meeting him on at least one occasion, casually on another occasion and we have had very good conversations here in LH 2000.  Unlike Deputy Brady, I have not yet managed to get to the embassy but it is something that I would like to do.  In my case, I tend to commute a lot so it is not easy for me to visit embassies in the evenings.  I agree with Senator Wilson that the ambassador is very well known in here.<\/p> <p>  Ireland, with the EU, supports Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Senator Wilson may have been the catalyst but there was a motion passed in the Seanad in 2018 giving further expression to that and we have been against the aggression.  Earlier I perused the briefing notes, the ambassador's presentation and the chronicle of displaced persons, of torture and of arrests, which made very grim reading.  That can never be taken off the table and we must never lose sight of the human rights issues in the region.<\/p> <p>  In July 2016, agreement was reached on a deep and comprehensive free trade area with the EU, which is good.  I would personally be a great supporter of Georgia's movement towards accession to the EU.  I say to the Chairman of this committee and colleagues here that we have a duty within the EU to support and give voice to accession.  Indeed, as other colleagues have said earlier, we must support Georgia in its new capacity in the UN.  I note that the EU has contributed &euro;410 million to Georgia between 2014 and 2016, which I support.  I wish Georgia well with accession.<\/p> <p>  I join with colleagues in expressing support for the position of Georgia because we are greatly distressed by the civil rights abuses and horrible effects of aggression in the region. Thankfully, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and the Overseas Development Institute, ODI, have reported that the recent elections in Georgia were a great success in terms of process, on which I congratulate the ambassador.<\/p> <p>  I ask the ambassador to please enlighten us about the continuing boycott of parliament by the opposition in Georgia.  Naturally, the boycott is a concern for the ambassador but it is a concern for us too.  What steps are being taken to resolve the matter?  I have a lot of personal involvement in Albania, on behalf of the Council of Europe, so I know that there is always an onus on the majority or governing party to make an effort to accommodate the opposition and bring them onboard.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the six-point peace plan.  Senator Wilson asked questions along these lines but I want to hear about the continuing day-to-day breaches of the peace plan.  I was shocked when I heard the ambassador say that the conflict has displaced 150,000 people. <\/p> <p>  The points that the ambassador made about foreign direct investment were well made.  While Ireland does not have a lot of input in that area it is important that such investment happens and that good signals are sent out.  The ambassador also made an interesting point about getting green energy to Europe, which is an issue that could become relevant.<\/p> <p>  I come from an area that also informed the questions asked by Senator Wilson because he said that it is important that agriculture and dairy products go to Georgia.  Certainly the region where I live and where I come from have a very developed food processing sector.  Has much been done to link up with the very large food processing firms in counties Cavan and Monaghan like Lakeland Dairies and Glanbia?  Perhaps the ambassador might speak specifically about the issue.<\/p> <p>  I strongly support Georgia's accession to the EU because therein lies the solution to a lot of its problems.<\/p><p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to raise those issues.

There are many signed treaties on alliance and integration of the Russia Federation with the illegal regimes in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali.  A few weeks ago, another extremely dangerous step was taken taken with the recent programme on the creation of common, social and economic space between the Russian Federation and the occupied Abkhazia region of Georgia, which will serve as a drastic turning point in the <i>de facto<\/i>annexation.  On the one hand we are talking about occupation and on the other annexation of those regions.  This is happening gradually through different treaties, all of them illegal.  At the same time, this is how Russia is acting towards the annexation of both these regions.<br\/><br\/>I will be brief regarding Georgia's relations with our neighbours.  I have already spoken about Russia.  We have an excellent relationship with all neighbours, including Azerbijan, Armenia and Turkey.

I also thank the Chairman for his warm words for Hanukkah, which connects exactly to my first point.<\/p> <p>  Before we turn to contemporary geopolitics, I would like to refer to today's date, which happens to mark the commencement of the Jewish festival of Chanukah.  This evening, Jews all around the world are celebrating the lighting of the first candle, of eight, of Hanukkah.  This holiday commemorates the successful rebellion of the Jews in the land of Israel against the Seleucid Empire.  That Jewish struggle, from 167 B.C. to 160 B.C., resulted in the re-dedication of the Temple on Temple Mount, marking the opening of yet another chapter of Jewish sovereignty in what is now Israel, with Jerusalem as its capital.<\/p> <p>  On a personal level, as ambassador of the modern State of Israel, this holiday bears special significance as it highlights the historical continuity of the Jewish people in our land, the age-old bond with Jerusalem and, indeed, the direct line that connects today's Jewish state, which I represent, to that Jewish state of more than 2,000 years ago.  This history is well documented in biblical, archeological and historical sources.  Moreover, on a more personal level, my family home is in the city of Modiin, which is built near and named after ancient Modiin, the very place where that rebellion started.<\/p> <p>  Throughout history, the Middle East has witnessed the rise and fall of local powers, as well as of foreign occupiers.  Jewish sovereignty flourished, and then declined.  Our independence was followed by occupation, destruction and exile, foreign rule, and again, by a national revival with the rise of Zionism and the establishment of the modern state of Israel.<\/p> <p>  If we move from the wider historical perspective to the concrete issues facing us currently, in order to give a concise overview of the various subjects that are currently on the agenda of Israeli decision makers, I chose to focus today on the following: the Abraham accords, the Iranian threat, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Palestinian issue, and Covid-19, which affects us all, and its impact on Israel's international development co-operation.<\/p> <p>  The Abraham accords, which refer to the historic peace agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, represent a strategic paradigm shift in the Middle East.  A growing number of Arab states recognise that Israel is not an enemy, but rather a valuable partner for prosperity and a strategic ally in dealing with common challenges.  The agreements signed between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and, hopefully, soon with other countries, are aimed at tackling the real core issues in the Middle East; both the threats and the opportunities.  The agreements consolidate the co-operation of moderate countries confronting the extremists' axis of Iran and its proxies.  The alignment of goodwill, knowledge and resources in areas such as trade, food security, renewable energy, high-tech, innovation, research and development, transportation, water treatment, public health and fighting Covid-19, carry huge long-term benefits to our peoples and to the entire region.  I believe one issue of tremendous importance to all states in the Middle East is climate change, which also has a direct geopolitical impact on the Middle East which is not often discussed.  If we can find ways to co-operate together to combat the effects of climate change, it could mitigate some of the negative impacts on our region.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that these agreements do not come at the expense of the Palestinian issue.  Rather, they provide an opportunity for a renewal of the peace process in a more supportive environment.  We call upon all countries to support those agreements and the new atmosphere they have created, and to encourage other parties, including the Palestinians, to join and take an active part in this new momentum for peace and co-operation.<\/p> <p>  The Iranian regime continues to constitute the biggest threat to the region and through its nuclear programme, combined with the ongoing development of ballistic capabilities, as well as the arming of its terrorist proxies, also far beyond the Middle East.  The Ayatollah's regime continues to pursue its goal of becoming a nuclear military power while at the same time it continues its efforts to destabilise the region, both directly and through its proxies.<\/p> <p>  Recently, the secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, confirmed, once again, that Iran continues to enrich and store uranium in enrichment levels and quantities far exceeding its international obligations.  The secretary general also confirmed that Iran has failed to provide reliable answers to the IAEA concerns relating to its nuclear activities.  The Iranian regime continues with its policy of deceit while pushing forward its efforts to become a nuclear threat.  In the past, firm sanctions proved the only efficient means to force a change in Iranian policy - including bringing it to the negotiation table.  A strong sanctions regime, led by the United States, is required in order to thwart that nuclear threat.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, Iran continues its efforts to destabilise the region in order to establish its influence through a northern \"Shi'ite arch\", which members can see on their screens, from Iran through Iraq to Syria and to Lebanon and the eastern Mediterranean, and through a southern arm in Yemen and to the Gaza Strip.<\/p> <p>  At all times, even during its economic crisis, Iran has continued to spend huge sums of money to arm and support militias and terrorist groups in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen and elsewhere.  An effective ban on selling arms to Iran should be applied to limit its destructive policy.<\/p> <p>  The Iranian regime is using Syria as another front against Israel.  Israel will not accept this and will continue to do whatever is necessary to thwart this strategic threat.  A total roll-back of Iranian forces and militias, including Hezbollah, from Syria is essential.<\/p> <p>  In Lebanon, the Hezbollah terror organisation, financed and backed by Iran, continues its project of upgrading its arsenal of rockets, making them much more accurate.  This precision project is considered a major threat by Israel.  Hezbollah continues to place its military facilities in the heart of civilian areas in Beirut and store rockets and weapons in villages and private houses in south Lebanon.<\/p><p>Hezbollah continues to place its military facilities in the heart of civilian areas in Beirut and store rockets and weapons in villages and private houses in south Lebanon.  These are lethal ticking bombs in the midst of the Lebanese civilian population, who are being cynically exploited as human shields by Hezbollah.  In addition, Hezbollah attack tunnels, crossing into Israel, have been discovered by the Israeli Defence Forces in recent months.  This act of aggression was initiated from within south Lebanon, sometimes close to United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, positions.  Israel sees the Lebanese Government as responsible for any hostilities initiated from within its territory.  Israel&rsquo;s position is also that UNIFIL must boost its operations to fulfil its mandate in full. <\/p><p> The whole of Hezbollah should be declared a terrorist organisation without erroneously differentiating a political wing from a military one.  The list of countries that have declared all of Hezbollah a terrorist organisation now includes 19 countries including Israel, the US, the UK, Germany and also the Arab League.<\/p><p> On a more positive note, recently, Israel and Lebanon started negotiations, with American involvement, with the aim to reach an agreement on their maritime border.  Such agreement will contribute to stability in the region and will support an economic recovery of Lebanon.<\/p><p> I will now move on to the Palestinian issue.  I will start with our view of the reality, and we will discuss the current implications later.  The strong Jewish connection to the land of Israel, with Jerusalem at its heart, is deeply rooted in over 3,000 years of well documented history.  Members can see images on their screens of different historical periods, archaeological findings relevant to those periods and images of the festival of Chanukah, which begins today.  These 3,000 years of the history of Israel include periods of independence, occupation by foreign powers, exiles and national revivals.  At all times, Jerusalem has been the national, spiritual, cultural and religious centre of the Jewish people and always served as its capital during periods of full or partial sovereignty.<\/p><p> This brings us to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  There is no denying that the Palestinians are there, and that they have their claims and their ideology.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is more than 100 years old.  Historically, Palestinian leaders have followed a policy of repeatedly rejecting opportunities to achieve peace, some of which are shown in the maps on the screens.  These missed opportunities brought tragedy and suffering upon both the Palestinian people and others, including the Israelis.  If members so wish, I will relate this point to the map that is now appearing on their screens.  Israelis and Palestinians are destined to live side by side.  We hope the Palestinian leadership learns from its historic mistakes first, but not only, for the sake of its own people.  We call on the Palestinians to join the new positive momentum of peace and co-operation created by the Abraham accords.  We call on them to come to the negotiation table and start a direct, bilateral serious negotiation without any preconditions.  We call upon the friends of the Palestinians to encourage them to do so.<\/p><p> Like the vast majority of countries around the world, Covid-19 has posed many challenges in Israel.  The very best of Israel&rsquo;s start-up nation has come to the forefront with medics, scientists, innovators and entrepreneurs dedicating their efforts towards developing vaccines, tests and treatments for Covid-19, as well as other measures to deal with the societal impact of the virus.<\/p><p> This pandemic knows no borders.  It has also emphasised the importance of Israeli-Palestinian co-operation.  The UN Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace, Nikolay Mladenov, has hailed this co-operation as \"exemplary\".  Since March, Israel has done its utmost to assist the Palestinians in measures to deal with Covid-19 by facilitating the supply of thousands of donated test kits and large volumes of PPE, guiding Palestinian healthcare staff in coping with Covid-19 and facilitating other aid activities.  Israel also carried out a public health campaign in Arabic to advise Palestinians in coping with the pandemic.  Israeli hospitals have been and continue to be a model for coexistence as Jewish, Muslim and Christian healthcare staff work together to achieve the best outcomes for their patients.<\/p><p> On a broader level, MASHAV, Israel's agency for international development co-operation, has continued to share its expertise in development technologies and techniques with partners around the world, but with a specific emphasis on Covid-19.  The agency was founded in 1958 when the state of Israel had just marked its tenth anniversary of independence.  It was one of the first government aid agencies in the world.  Since the beginning, its focus has been on the sharing of expertise, which has helped Israel to develop rapidly since 1948.  This is achieved through training people from the developing world in areas such as agriculture, healthcare, food security and women&rsquo;s empowerment.  This training is done in person in Israel and abroad, and MASHAV also works on international partnerships and consultancies.  In recent years, MASHAV has flown approximately 2,500 trainees from developing countries to Israel for training on an annual basis, as well as conducting some 300 short-term consultancies and on-the-spot courses in developing host countries each year.<\/p><p> Since the onset of the pandemic, MASHAV has adapted its activities to providing training for thousands of participants from developing countries through webinars.  Among other activities, MASHAV hosted an online conference for women leaders, in which Amina Mohamed, the Deputy Secretary General of the UN, participated, alongside senior participants from the WHO and Israel.  Practical on-the-ground humanitarian assistance has been provided in more than 120 cases, mainly in the least developed countries as well as in low-middle and upper-middle income countries.  Israel has been assisting with public health, supplying PPE, providing computers for the elderly and young people to access remote learning and assisting microenterprises, as well as providing assistance through food programmes.  MASHAV is evidence of one of the founding principles of the Israeli state, which is our duty to empower individuals and communities in need by sharing our knowledge and expertise.<\/p><p> The Middle East is a complex region, as is each and every issue I have given an overview of in this presentation.  In order to understand it, and certainly in order to have a constructive contribution, one must be aware of the complexities, the challenges and the opportunities that our changing reality holds.  Israel sees peace with its neighbours, including the Palestinians, as a vital interest.  We hope the new momentum for peace will soon include the Palestinians as well as the rest of the moderate Arab world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It is the first time I have met him and have had the opportunity to put important questions to him.  The issue in Palestine and the conflict with Israel is one of ongoing concern for everyone.  Most people would like to see a peaceful outcome to the conflict based on a two-state solution.  As I see it, one of the biggest impediments to that is the ongoing expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank.  We know that over the summer, in the run-up to the Israeli elections, plans to further annex the West Bank by another 30% were announced.<\/p><p>While all that is happening, it makes a peaceful outcome very difficult to achieve.  I have some questions on that.<\/p><p> Some of the facts are interesting, and these are from the director of the Map Association and Jewish Settlement Specialist, which was closed down by Israel.  There are 252 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and ten Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem.  There are 640,000 Jewish settlers in the region and 220,000 of them are in East Jerusalem.  In 1988, when Palestine's independence document was proclaimed, the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank was 66,500.  There was then a major ramping up of illegal settlers in the West Bank.  In 1993, when the Oslo Accords were signed, there were 116,000 settlers.  When the Camp David summit took place in the US in 2000, the number of illegal settlers had increased to 184,000.  By 2014, when talks were held to resolve the conflict, the number of West Bank settlers had surged to 371,000.  As I said, there are now over 640,000 illegal settlers in the West Bank.<\/p><p> My first question relates to the recognised borders set by the UN in 1967.  What is the position of Israel on those borders?  It is a massive reduction of the traditional land of the Palestinians at only 22% of what was their traditional land.  I seek the ambassador's perspective on that.  Since 1947, there was a cleansing of Palestinian land with over 700,000 native Palestinian people forced from their land and into exile in refugee camps across the region.  The Nakba, as it is called, and the right to return for those Palestinians is another issue of contention.  First, it is an issue of contention as to whether the Nakba happened at all.  Some Israelis refuse even to use the word.  What is the position regarding the right to return for those who were forced from their lands?<\/p><p> I also have a question about the ongoing land, sea and air blockade of Gaza and what is seen as the collective punishment of the people of Gaza, which is illegal under international law.  I wish to get the ambassador's perspective.  Does he consider it just to collectively punish the people of Gaza?  Does he think, like the international community, of the human impact it is having on the people in Gaza in trying to survive?  Does he see it as illegal, like the vast majority of the international community?<\/p><p> I will turn to the section about the Iranian regime and the paragraph in which the ambassador stated that \"Recently, the secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, confirmed, once again, that Iran continues to enrich and store uranium ....\".  He went on to say that the secretary general also confirmed that Iran has failed to provide reliable answers to the IAEA concerns relating to its nuclear activities.  I note that, but there is a great deal of ambiguity about Israel's nuclear activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#J00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to intervene but I must ask the Deputy to pose questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#K00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I am going to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#K00300","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":617,"content":"<p>We are running out of time and every member wants to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#K00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>It is widely reported that Israel is the only country in the Middle East to have nuclear warheads, estimated at between 80 and 100.  I ask the ambassador to comment on that.  Will Israel puts its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards and join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons?<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to the human rights abuses of minors or children in Palestine.  Last week, a 13-year-old named Ali Abu Alia was shot and killed in the West Bank.  In the previous two weeks, four other Palestinian children were shot and severely injured.  They were aged between 15 and 16 years and were shot in the chest, eye and head.  They are undergoing treatment.  Unfortunately, such incidents are not isolated.  I am not trying to create a hierarchy of victims or victimhood in all this, but I wish to ask specifically about the abuses of children.  Children enjoy special protection under international law, but consider the number of Palestinian minors in detention in Israel using the Israeli military detention system.  In any year there are 500 to 700 children who are arrested and go through the military detention system.  Since 2000, over 10,000 Palestinian have gone through that system and were incarcerated.  There is much international criticism, and rightly so.  What is the thinking there and can the ambassador justify the abuse of minors in this situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#K00500","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador and thank him for his comprehensive presentation.

Will he outline how Israel proposes to support the Palestinian people as we go through a vaccination programme?  Will it take a proactive role in that and in providing the vaccines and the facilities?  We know that very specialised facilities are required for the vaccine.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the recent accord with Bahrain.  It is the beginning of the peace we would all like to see in the Middle East.<\/p> <p>  I note the ambassador's comments on Iran.

We have not heard that story and I would be interested to hear something about that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of terrorists and their political wing, if we have learned nothing else in Ireland, we have learned that at some stage one has to speak to the political wing of terrorist groups in order to find peace.

I thank him for facilitating a meeting with me recently in which we had a very genuine and straight discussion.  I found the meeting very worthwhile and I will raise some of the issues I raised then again today.  By way of very quick background, we in this country are acutely aware of the sufferings of the Jewish people historically, and we are also completely in favour of a two-state peace solution.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Chairman, who is a distinguished former Minister for Foreign Affairs, have both sought a two-state solution in the region.  That is what we want.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the recent curbs.  I also welcome the postponement of the annexation.  However, I must ask about plans in October for 5,000 new settlement homes on the West Bank.  Does Israel propose to go ahead with those?  If so, does the ambassador not agree with the contention that those homes would be in areas that would go to Palestine in the event of a two-state solution and that that presents a threat to the peace process?<\/p> <p>  I also wish to ask about the 1,257 housing units in the east Jerusalem neighbourhood of Givat Hamatos, and the proposed construction of the houses on 15 November and tenders being sought for them.  The same question arises in regard to them.  Does that present the threat of closure of access to Jerusalem from Bethlehem?  The ambassador will appreciate that our culture is among the reasons we have always had a great interest in Israel.  I welcome our trading balances.  In this country we are concerned about the religious sites in the context of those settlements.  I also wish to ask about the demolitions and confiscations in those regions and about the situation in Gaza.<\/p> <p>  We ask these questions as friends.  There is no point in having an inane, silly discussion here where we welcome the ambassador and make facile comments.  As a friendly nation we need to put these points to the ambassador and to ask him again for a further commitment to the peace process and how he sees it evolving.  Does he accept the contention that the continuation of the settlements ultimately threatens the peace process?  I see this as an exercise in goodwill.  I welcome the talks between Israel and Lebanon and the efforts to reach agreement.  Any attempt to achieve peace and any incremental peace is welcome.  We just want peace in the Middle East.  We are friends of Israel but we also want to know that we will get two states and that we do not discriminate or dehumanise anyone in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#L00100","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Reilly.

It is regrettable that this is our first interaction after my being here for more than two years.  I thank him for his comments.  I will make some general statements that I hope will begin to answer the questions about Jerusalem, the status of the 1967 lines and the issue of settlements.  I will touch upon it on the basis of the main ideas.<br\/><br\/>As members saw in my presentation, the connection of the Jewish people is to the whole of what we call Israel today.  This is where the Jewish people were born, thrived and have their historical, cultural and religious roots.  This part of the land members can see on the 1949 to 1967 map, which we now call the West Bank, was formed as a consequence of the war of extermination that was forced on us by the Arab world and the Palestinians, a war that was waged against UN General Assembly Resolution 181 on the partition, the borders, which can be seen on the second map on the left.  The Arab world and the Palestinians went to war to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state at the time because it also involved the creation of the Jewish state.  That was one of the most important historical sins of Palestinian leadership.  It was one of the major ones.  The lines delineating the West Bank were forged in the Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan in 1949.  I will read from the agreement how they were drawn and the logic behind them.<\/p> <blockquote> \tNo provision of this Agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims and positions of either Party hereto in the ultimate peaceful settlement of the Palestine question, the provisions of this Agreement being dictated exclusively by military considerations.<br \/><br \/>and<br \/><br \/>The Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of this Agreement are agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto. <\/blockquote> <p>This is the agreement that drew what we call today the 1967 lines.  This is the agreement that defines, for the first time in history, this piece of land that is now called the West Bank.  It was never a border.  It was an armistice line and I just outlined the logic behind it and its aim.  The United Nations called for the partition of the land between Israelis and Palestinians.  There is no question but the Israelis and Palestinians have to find a way to live side by side, be it this way or another.  Nobody is going anywhere.  Final borders were never drawn in history.  This is in contrast to borders in other cultures that are recognised as international borders.  The green line between the West Bank and Israel was never meant to be a border.<\/p><p>In this light, one can also see the settlements of Jews going back and continuing with renewed efforts what we started in the 19th century of Jews re-establishing themselves in their historical land.  This is not to exclude them again.  Some political compromise will have to be found between Israelis and Palestinians.  There is, however, no historic division of the land.  There never was and was never meant to be in the lines of 1949.  That applies even more to Jerusalem.<\/p><p> As I mentioned in my opening words, we are celebrating Hanukkah today.  Hanukkah celebrates the dedication of the Jewish temple on Temple Mount in the old city of Jerusalem more than 2,000 years ago.  Nobody is in a position to tell Jews this is not their place, with all due respect.  Again, this does not exclude or prevent Palestinians to put forward their claims when they come to the negotiating table.  It does not prevent them from doing so.  This is not a precondition to anything.  We call on Palestinians to come to the table without any preconditions.  We have strong positions, some of which I just mentioned.  They have equally strong positions on their side.  I showed the committee where our positions are coming from.  The only way to go forward with that is to sit together at the table and try to find a solution to one of the most complicated conflicts in the world today.  It is one with historical, religious, national and deep layers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#L00700","nonspeaker":"H.E.

As a newly elected Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy in the last election, I have had no correspondence from the Israeli Embassy.  Perhaps, if the ambassador is open to it, I will give him my email address at the end of this session.  I will certainly take him up on an invitation to meet outside of this setting.<\/p> <p>  It will probably come as no surprise to the ambassador that before any ambassador comes in, the members of the committee are provided with a comprehensive country note.  This is simply because ambassadors are not afforded the time to speak about every aspect of what goes on in the country they are here to represent.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise with the ambassador one issue, specifically, that caught my eye.  The note says that Israel is a highly developed and technologically advanced economy in terms of software, medical technologies and pharmaceuticals.  The next point, however, goes on to say that wages are low.  The next goes on to say that the education system has not been well invested in over the past number of years.  Is this accurate?  If so, why is that the case?  I have no issue with providing the ambassador with this but it states major investment and policy changes will be needed to even maintain current levels of achievement with regard to the education sector in Israel.  I find that perplexing, to be honest.  I would not have presumed this was an issue for the country the ambassador represents.<\/p> <p>  Finally, as others have referred to, while here previously, the Palestinian ambassador made a statement about Israel using occupied lands in a method to bypass its environmental laws, causing untold hardship for farmers due to the diversion of water.  Is this statement also something the ambassador would agree with?  If this is happening and Palestinians are buying back water at a premium, I believe we will all agree that access to water is a fundamental human right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#M00800","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Clarke for being so succinct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020121000002#M00900","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1607558400,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I wish the ambassador and the Jewish community in Ireland and throughout the world a happy Hanukkah.

One fundamental human right is the access to water.  Throughout the Middle East and, particularly, in Palestine at the minute, there is a water crisis and water shortages.  I note that Palestinians get less than 15% of the total yield of aquifers, leaving 85% of water controlled by Israel.<\/p> <p>  Does the ambassador believe Israel has more of a responsibility to help develop water access and more water equality in the Middle East, particularly as it pertains to the Palestinian community?

There were 850,000 Jewish refugees from Arab states.  Nobody speaks about them.  Most of them found their home in Israel.  They were not confined to refugee camps because we do not see our brothers as refugees.
