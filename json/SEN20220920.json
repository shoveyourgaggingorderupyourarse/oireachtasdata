It is now being raised as a Commencement matter at a time when I feel we are about to have a much wider discussion on the need for an increased Garda presence in our communities.<\/p> <p>The widely shared horrific scenes of gangs of joyriding thugs in a housing estate in Cherry Orchard have shocked many, but for many others, it is an all-too-familiar sight and shock has long since given way to resignation.  Ordinary law-abiding citizens in certain parts of this country are terrorised day in, day out by low-life criminal hooligans who have no respect for their communities, the people in them or the law.  It would seem that there are some areas that have been declared unofficial no-go zones even by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Faced with the challenges of policing these areas, the decision has been made not to police them at all or just barely.<\/p> <p>The role of garda&iacute; as guardians of the peace should not be limited by post code.  Every effort must be made by the Government to ensure that the force is adequately manned, trained and equipped to carry out this role.  Every street of the capital would be made much safer if there was a pair of garda&iacute; marching down the street every 30 to 40 minutes.  Certain streets do not need this.  Others probably need more.  If we had as many patrol cars out cracking down on violent crime as we did rounding up non-Covid-compliant persons, this would be a much safer country.<\/p> <p>This summer, the residents of Laytown were subjected to a vicious brawl that saw golf clubs and baseball bats being used as weapons.  It came less than a month after a mass protest in Bettystown over the lack of a Garda station for what is one of the country's busiest coastal areas.  Laytown Garda station is not even close to being fully manned.  Most of the area is served by the station in Ashbourne, a full 33 km away.  If that station is busy, an emergency call can be taken by the Garda station in Kildare town, almost 100 km away.  This is unacceptable in a developed country like Ireland and it is a kick in the face for the people of the area, who deserve a minimum standard of policing.  Either we need a brand new 24-7 Garda station in the area or a Minister needs to speak to the Garda Commissioner and ensure that Laytown Garda station is transformed into a 24-hour active service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#B00400","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank the Senator for raising this important matter and requesting that the Minister establish a new Garda station to serve the areas of Laytown and Bettystown.<\/p> <p>The Senator will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is, by law, responsible for the management and administration of Garda business and for determining the deployment of garda&iacute; throughout the State.

The Government will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recruiting Garda members and Garda staff through the upcoming budget and over the coming years.  A key pillar of the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, is building stronger and safer communities.  Prioritising visible policing in rural communities will ensure community policing is at the forefront of our police service and is an integral strand of our social contract with the public.<\/p><p>I understand that the Laytown district, consisting of Laytown and Duleek subdistricts, was created in 2008 arising from the county boundary realignment project emanating from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which saw the introduction of joint policing committees.  Laytown Garda station operates on a paired system with Duleek Garda station.  This enables a  24-7 service to be provided between two subdistricts.  I also understand that additional support is provided, as required, from district headquarters at Ashbourne Garda station, which is operational on a 24-7 basis.  In addition, there is a marked patrol car to respond to calls 24-7 and when numbers allow, there is a second patrol car utilised as a second responding vehicle.<\/p><p>I am aware that the Garda Commissioner visited Laytown Garda station on 20 July this year where he met local Garda management and members of the station party.  Matters of facilities, resourcing and criminality, including public order and the boundary between the Meath and Louth divisions, were discussed at this meeting.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are draft plans to enhance the policing service provided from Laytown Garda station and to examine options to upgrade the station.

The people of the Ashbourne area and Laytown-Bettystown coastal area deserve a 24-hour station.<\/p> <p>The area in which the current Laytown Garda station is situated is the middle of a housing estate.  There is no way it can upgrade that facility there.  In 2009, Fianna F&aacute;il announced it was going to build a brand new Garda station over there.  That never materialised either.  There have been many promises along the way for the people of the coast.  That area has grown substantially over the past five to ten years.  Duleek has also grown substantially, but particularly the east coast of County Meath from Southgate right across to Julianstown.  It needs a full-time Garda station.  I would not be here asking for it if it was not something we need.  We have a Garda station in Duleek that is manned part time.  It is not a full-time station; it is a part-time station.  The needs of the coast are far greater, however.  The time it takes members of the Garda in Ashbourne to get to a case on the coast can sometimes be up to one hour.  The Minister of State's response mentioned visible policing in rural areas; it does not happen.  It did not happen yesterday in Cherry Orchard and it is certainly not happening in County Meath.

I wish to discuss the issue of CCTV.  We all know CCTV is an invaluable tool in deterring people from engaging in offences and public disorder.  It is also a valuable tool when a crime is committed or when public disorder occurs.  It enhances and enables the investigative process and can assist in the identification of perpetrators.  In fact, a 2013 study by the UK College of Policing found that an estimated 16 out of every 100 crimes were prevented through the use of CCTV.  Specifically on vehicular crime, for every 100 crimes, an average of 26 crimes were prevented.  Inhabitants of many towns could point to instances and certain areas in their towns that have become no-go areas, especially at night.  CCTV has the ability to provide major assistance to all crime prevention measures being undertaken across all sectors of society.<\/p> <p>People are sick and tired of assaults and antisocial behaviour, including littering.  The benefit of CCTV systems, particularly in urban areas, is immeasurable.  In that respect, the community CCTV scheme is an excellent initiative but, unfortunately, the implementation of the scheme leaves an awful lot to be desired.  It is, and has been for a number of years, the source of significant frustration in towns such as Monaghan, where the application process first began in 2017.  This scheme should have ensured that towns like Monaghan and many others elsewhere had their CCTV systems up and running long ago.  Communities and the Garda want it.  We all have a responsibility to bring in whatever measures are possible to assist garda&iacute; to do their jobs.<\/p> <p>There was an impasse for some time with regard to the issue of data control.  In the meantime, assaults and burglaries have continued throughout the country.  This impasse cannot be allowed to continue when people are at risk of assault on our streets.  Many schemes were approved for funding, including &euro;25,000 for Monaghan town in June 2020.  Unfortunately, it has yet to get off the ground.  I am aware that the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na digital recording Bill 2021 was approved by the Government and published on 29 April 2021.  We are waiting for that legislation to pass through both Houses.  At the time, the Minister also outlined that it was planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current CCTV scheme to bring it into line with the proposals in this new legislation.<\/p> <p>In summary, we are saying that there are no doubts about the benefits of CCTV.  That much we all agree on, but the lack of progress in bringing schemes like this to fruition is very frustrating.  I am hopeful that the Minister of State will give some indication of progress in this regard.  Have the obstacles regarding data control now been overcome?  When can we look forward to these schemes being rolled out?  People have been waiting too long for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#D00300","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the very important matter of community CCTV, in particular as it relates to Monaghan town and Carrickmacross, County Monaghan.

I understand that the application process in respect of Monaghan town and Carrickmacross is still ongoing.<\/p><p>As the Senator may be aware, community-based CCTV is currently governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006, Sl 289\/2006.  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must be approved by the local joint policing committee; have a data protection impact assessment prepared; have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must act as a joint data controller with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and a joint data controller agreement must be put in place; and have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have been in place since 2006.  Agreement was reached on a revised CCTV scheme, which has been included in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Recording Devices) Bill 2022.  The Bill was approved by Government on 21 June 2022 and published on 4 August.  This Bill will provide a new statutory basis for community-based CCTV schemes going forward and will be fully compliant with data protection law.  Under the new legislation, only local authorities or Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na members can be authorised by the Garda Commissioner to operate community CCTV schemes.  There is a provision to contract other organisations to operate the CCTV on behalf of the local authority or the Garda.  I want to acknowledge the important contribution made by local community groups across the country to local CCTV schemes.  Community groups will continue to play their part in CCTV schemes via the establishment of the local community safety partnerships, which will be rolled out under the policing, security and community safety Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#D00400","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

Just as the Government's community safety policy recognises that community safety is a whole-of-government responsibility and not solely a concern for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Department of Justice, the strength of the CCTV schemes nationwide results from the collaboration at community level, with garda&iacute;, local authorities and community groups all playing their part to create an effective and robust CCTV scheme.

I submitted it following representations from a group of independent teachers who operate under the name \"fair post-primary redeployment for teachers\".  The group currently has 300 members nationwide, all of whom feel there is no way out of the situation they face.<\/p> <p>I am sure it is a source of great celebration when teachers become permanent or are awarded a contract of indefinite duration, CID, and become permanent employees in their school but if, for whatever reason, they wish to move school or county, their choices are limited.  In many cases, they would lose their permanency.  Teachers who work for education and training boards, ETBs, for example, the Galway and Roscommon ETB or the Laois and Offaly ETB, can be redeployed but only within the specific ETB which limits the amount of options available.  As I understand it, nurses, garda&iacute;, primary school teachers and most public servants have the option of redeployment which is all the more frustrating for post-primary teachers who wish to move.  <\/p> <p>There is a post-primary voluntary redeployment scheme, applications for which must be made by February each year and decisions have to be made quite quickly.  Some decisions will be made before vacancies are announced and before teachers have made the decision to retire or move on.  Under the scheme, redeployment must be completed by the end of May each year so for the Department to complete a redeployment, schools have to be made aware of any vacancies - most likely retirements - by the end of May, which is a problem.<\/p> <p>Teachers feel there is no way out if they want to work closer to home.  I know of one woman in County Galway who teachers in County Cork.  She just got married to a guy from Galway and they live in Galway.  They have a mortgage and this is putting pressure on their marriage.  Another member of the aforementioned group lives with his young wife and family in County Galway and travels to County Meath each day to work.  They have to pay a mortgage so he cannot just give up a job in the hope that he will be made permanent in a new school.  Again, this is putting the relationship under pressure.<\/p> <p>A motion was passed at the Teacher's Union of Ireland, TUI, congress calling on the executive council of the union to negotiate with the Department of Education and other employers to establish a national voluntary redeployment panel and to ensure that those teachers who wish to relocate would keep their permanent or CID status.  The motion called on the Department and other employers in the post-primary education sector to devise an appropriate online portal through which teachers seeking voluntary redeployment could enter their details to seek a direct swap with a matching teacher seeking a reverse relocation.  Teachers believe that the establishment of such a scheme is essential for the well-being of teachers who may have to travel for hours daily to and from work.  A guy living in Galway who works in Offaly travels 160 km per day.  If he were to get a position within 10 km of his home that would mean 140 km less driving every day, not to mention 140 km worth of emissions.  If the teacher who swaps with him does the same, then 280 km worth of carbon emissions would be saved per day.  In a standard school year that equates to 46,480 km less driving for those two teachers, greatly enhancing their quality of life.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It makes sense on paper.

It is lovely to see the students in the Seanad.  I passed them as I was walking down the corridor from the D&aacute;il.  They are welcome, as are their teachers.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  This affords me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to teaching redeployment schemes currently operating in post-primary schools.  Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by the Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and available on the Department website.  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for each individual school authority.  The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and the quality of teaching and learning are, in the first instance, a matter for the school management authorities.<\/p> <p>The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers to schools where vacancies exist.  Such a scenario may occur where enrolment drops in a school.  This scheme includes provision for a teacher in a surplus school who wants to volunteer to redeploy from that school to another location, subject to the agreement of school management.  This provision can be facilitated as a means of avoiding a compulsory redeployment.  Ensuring efficiency in the annual redeployment processes is significant in terms of managing the overall teacher numbers.<\/p> <p>Following discussions between the relevant stakeholders, a voluntary redeployment scheme has operated on a pilot basis in specific regions in recent years.  Permanent teachers employed in these regions are given an opportunity to volunteer for a transfer to other areas in the country if such a transfer would create a vacancy that would facilitate the redeployment of a surplus permanent teacher in the region.  To date, the pilot voluntary redeployment scheme has operated in 24 counties.  The scheme assists the Department to achieve its objective of redeploying all the surplus permanent teachers.  Teachers who applied under the scheme and were not facilitated with a transfer continue to have the option of applying for posts in their preferred location that are advertised in the normal manner.<\/p> <p>Since the introduction of redeployment at post-primary level, more than 800 teachers have been redeployed, ensuring an equitable and fair teacher allocation system to all schools.  The Department is mindful that, in selecting areas of the country for inclusion in the voluntary transfer scheme, it achieves its key purpose, which is to ensure that surplus teachers are successfully redeployed.  Any future considerations around expanding or selecting new locations will be made in the context of the operation of the redeployment scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#G00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.  She said more than 800 teachers have been redeployed.  The figures for 2019 are 126 applications, of which eight were redeployed, while in 2018, 178 applied and 21 were redeployed.  Those are relatively small numbers of successful redeployments.  If teachers are willing to transfer, both have permanent contracts and teach the same subjects and no one is being coerced or forced, I do not understand why that cannot be done.  If someone is living in Galway and wants to move to Cork while someone in Cork wants to move to Galway and they can be accommodated without losing their permanent status, a scheme needs to be developed that will allow that to happen.  I ask for positive engagement from the Department of the Minister, Deputy Foley, following the TUI motion at congress.

The matter I raise is the issue of the monkeypox vaccine, the lack of supply of vaccines and of a programme of vaccination, and the disappointing lack of communication with the gay community.  It is causing huge anxiety.  I appreciate that this is not the Minister of State's area of responsibility but I thank her for being here today.<\/p> <p>The issue of the supply of vaccines is a challenge not just for Ireland but for the wider world.  If we look across the world to parts of Europe, our near neighbours, and to North America, we see that vaccination programmes have been rolled out quite successfully.  I ask the Government, the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC, to put in place now - in the autumn of 2022 - a comprehensive vaccination programme.  I hope the Government will acknowledge that the vaccination programme is necessary but is incomplete.  At the moment we have an initiative targeted at a small cohort of men in the gay community.  It is not expansive enough and it does not cover the wider community but it needs to do so.<\/p> <p>In tandem, the messaging from the Government, the HSE and NIAC has been very disappointing.  It has been uncertain.  The whole issue of the vaccination programme and the messaging has been slow and uncertain.  We need to have a promotional campaign and messaging for the MSM community.  I say this as a member of the gay community.  I am conscious that many people may think monkeypox is a sexually transmitted infection, STI, which it is not.  It is much more than that.<\/p> <p>For many of us, it seems that we are going back to the 1980s, when we had another epidemic called HIV, and the way we were treated then.  I do not want that to happen now and to have a situation where we have people pigeonholed or victimised.  We need a whole-of-government approach in which clarity and accessibility are pivotal and part of what the Government does for the gay community.  I accept the Minister of State's bona fides have always been extraordinary.  I know she will go back to the Minister for Health following my genuine attempt to have a comprehensive vaccine roll-out.  It feels as though the gay community has been forgotten about again by the Government.<\/p> <p>I wish to ask about access to the vaccine.  I am aware that Ireland is part of the EU-wide approach to the vaccine.  Where stands Ireland now with regard to vaccine supply?  What is the status of our order?  What is the approach  of the Government and the HSE to a post-availability increase in supply of the vaccine in the context of the target audience?  Who will be allowed to get the vaccine?  When can it happen?  Have we a roadmap?  As other countries have done with the intradermal route in terms of administration of the vaccine, have we put in place an operation to change the issuing of the vaccine so we can administer more doses to more people?  It really is about defining where we are going to be in ten weeks or in ten days as opposed to where we are now, which is a very disappointing place.<\/p> <p>I look forward to the Minister of State's reply and thank her for being here.  This is a matter of extreme importance.  We cannot go back to where we were in the 1980s.  It is about ensuring we have a whole-of-government approach to the provision of the vaccine and to supply at a European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#H00300","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Buttimer for giving me the opportunity to speak to this issue and provide an update on the monkeypox vaccination programme.  I acknowledge his genuine contribution on this matter.  I believe I might have some information that might not be in the public domain.<\/p> <p>Since the notification of the first case of monkeypox in Europe, Ireland has moved quickly to respond to the disease outbreak.  The Department of Health and the HSE have implemented a broad range of public health measures to control the outbreak and continue to engage and raise awareness in respect of the disease.  I take on board what Senator Buttimer said, namely, that the message is disappointing and that there is a lack of communication.  He feels a promotional campaign is required.<\/p> <p>Following the World Health Organization's declaration of a public health emergency of international concern, a strategic advisory group, chaired by the interim Chief Medical Officer was convened to provide oversight and advice on the surveillance and management of monkeypox at national level, as well as the ongoing strategy to contain the outbreak.  The work of the multidisciplinary group builds on the significant work already undertaken by the HSE and the ongoing work of the HSE's national crisis management team.<\/p> <p>To date, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has been notified of 173 confirmed cases of monkeypox in Ireland.  Anyone, regardless of their sexuality, can get monkeypox if they are in close physical contact with a case.  However, the epidemiological picture to date in Ireland remains similar to that seen in other countries where cases are predominantly in the gay and bisexual men who have sex with men, gbMSM, community.  To help prevent and reduce infections in gbMSM community, the Department of Health and the HSE have implemented a proactive communications programme.  As Senator Buttimer will be aware, at this time, supplies of monkeypox vaccines in Ireland and in the EU are limited.  Ireland, along with other EU countries, is actively exploring options to increase our medium to long-term supply of vaccines.  The Department of Health and the HSE have been working closely with the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, HERA, to secure additional vaccine doses.  The first supply of vaccines procured by HERA and donated to member states has been received by Ireland.  HERA has provided a boost to member states' vaccination programmes by announcing that it has secured an additional 170,000 doses from the manufacturer with delivery available before the end of the year.  This brings the total number of vaccines secured for member states to more than 330,000 doses.<\/p> <p>The vaccination programme in Ireland is based on advice from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.  The vaccine is currently being offered to close contacts after a risk assessment and to some healthcare workers who may be at risk of exposure through their work.  Following updated NIAC advice, the vaccination programme is being expanded on a phased basis to vaccinate those at high risk of infection before they are exposed to the virus.  The HSE estimates that approximately 6,000 people may be at heightened risk of monkeypox infection.  The first phase of the vaccine programme, which is under way, is offering the vaccine to 600 people.  A proposed second phase, using the new intradermal method of administration, is expected to allow for vaccination of 40% to 50% of the estimated number in need.  The HSE is finalising a range of operational issues before beginning the second phase of the vaccine roll-out.<\/p> <p>I have listened intently to Senator Buttimer's genuine contribution.  I will bring his comments back to the Minister and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#J00100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

The Senator is right about how, when we look at the last two and a half years, the Covid vaccine was rolled out to all communities.  Based on current indications about global supplies of vaccines, Ireland is likely to have increased vaccine supplies later this year and next year.  The aim is to ensure that people at risk are offered a vaccine at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>However, it is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to prevent monkeypox infection.  Since the initial outbreak, significant work has been undertaken to raise awareness about the disease.  There has been extensive public engagement with local community representative groups.

The Minister for Health met the gay and bisexual men who have sex with men, gbMSM, representative groups and the HSE to discuss the outbreak and engagement events continue to be held around the country.

We are expecting not only the ordinary budget but also a cost-of-living package.  I am sure many people will have been speaking to local businesses across the country and will know the pressure they are under.  While we need to help households, families and citizens, we must also assist small businesses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I spoke to one small retailer in Ballinrobe in Mayo.  Their energy bill in August of last year was approximately &euro;17,000 for the year.  This year it is &euro;47,000.  That shows the colossal increases that businesses have sustained in a short period of time.  As was put to me bluntly by this particular business, if something is not done soon, difficult decisions will need to be taken.  I take that to mean that they may not be able to continue trading or to continue to employ people locally which of course would be of huge significance to any small town, right across the country.  I have spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, about this.  Obviously, none of us has any details specifically about next week&rsquo;s budget, but I understand that the Government has committed to a significant package for businesses.  I look forward to the details of that and to that much-needed easing of pressure on small business.<\/p><p>The second issue I would like to raise is dealing with the stress on families, which merits a wider debate in this House when we can facilitate it, perhaps with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, at some point.  I would like to see an increase in or an extension of parents&rsquo; leave and subsequently parents&rsquo; benefit.  It went from five weeks to seven weeks last year.  This was the leave that mum and dad, or either parent, can take up to the first two years of a child's life.  With all the talk about childcare, the cost of childcare and if, as rightly we should, we are putting huge funding into childcare, we also have to focus on facilitating parents to stay at home for longer if they choose to do that and on trying to take a little pressure off families by facilitating mum and dad to get much more extra time in that first year of life, which is needed.  We as a country should be aspiring to a year&rsquo;s leave for mum and a year&rsquo;s leave for dad.  Ultimately, this is about investing in children, about investing in families and about taking the stress off parents.  For many households, both parents are working, they are like two ships passing in the night.  They are seeing their child early in the morning and late at night and it is putting much pressure and strain on families.  One way to alleviate that pressure is to give parents more time off in those early years.  Again, this is something that I have raised directly with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, who I believe is raising it with the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, in the context of next week&rsquo;s budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#N00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I, too, would like to speak about next week&rsquo;s budget.  There are many worthy asks that will affect every family and household in the country.  I have spoken about those in the past and I hope to do so again during the week.<\/p> <p>I will raise a couple of specific cases.  This morning, the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI, held a briefing across the road.  We have spoken in this House before, I think it was on a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, about the worthy asks the alliance has, including the appointment of 20 additional nurse specialists across adult neurology and to fully resource at least four of the seven community neurorehabilitation teams that are required.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, is working actively regarding these issues and is pursuing these issues with the Minister for Health and within the Government.  Neurology waiting lists now stand at over 24,000, which is a 20% increase over five years.  This is a real issue for those families and individuals who are impacted.  Only one fifth of people with Parkinson's disease have access to a nurse specialist and Ireland has less than half the number of recommended specialist nurses for people with multiple sclerosis.  Those are worthy and necessary asks.  I met a young girl from Offaly at the briefing today who has an acquired brain injury and who has to travel to Dublin for private care.  She has been told that her future will be in a nursing home.  I know that extra resources have been put in over the last number of years to ensure that young people's places will not be in a nursing home, but in other settings.  That is important as well.  <\/p> <p>The other area I would like to acknowledge relates to a briefing that was organised by Senator Sherlock this morning on behalf of section 39 workers, which is a long-running saga.  It was organised by our representatives from SIPTU.  These are representatives of organisations who care for some of the most vulnerable across our society.  They have not seen pay increases in over a decade because they are not being paid directly by the State but by the organisations.  It is a worthy cause, and it is necessary that they are supported.  In groups like Ability West in Galway, this is having an impact on recruitment, because people are leaving their organisations to go to the HSE or to section 38 organisations.  These organisations have a high number of vacant positions.  The retention of staff is an issue as is staff morale.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The sustainability of their organisations is impacted by this issue.

That was a tremendous initiative by the AILG to bring forward CPD courses like that for its members and it professionalises the local government members, which is a good thing.<\/p> <p>My two colleagues have spoken on the forthcoming budget and it will be a tough time for Government.

More than 32,000 families have availed of the scheme and are living in their homes.  In my constituency of Wicklow, 1,354 families are living in their homes because of the help to buy scheme.  While the scheme is under review, it is imperative it is maintained in budget 2023.  It might need to be tweaked to get over some of the anomalies but it must be maintained, and I am asking the Leader to have a word with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to ensure the help to buy scheme is maintained in budget 2023.  We all follow the aspiration of owning our own home, and the help to buy scheme has proven to be a critical pathway to homeownership, which must be maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#P00300","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I begin by welcoming the news that a tender has been issued for the Narrow Water Bridge.  Senators will know this is a long-standing commitment by the Irish Government and the Executive in the North.  I know the Taoiseach and several other Ministers joined John O'Dowd, the Infrastructure Minister in the North, at a recent event at Narrow Water.  It has huge potential to transform the whole Carlingford Lough area and the south Down and north Louth areas in terms of tourism and community development and so I welcome that step forward.  <\/p> <p>I would welcome the opportunity to hear from the Minister on promoting all-Ireland tourism in the time ahead, particularly as the Seanad voted recently to oppose a measure.

Before the budget issues begin to dominate, I again call for statements from the Minister for Health on the issue of organ donation and, in particular, for an update on the human tissue Bill.  In the North, we recently passed legislation, appropriately called Daith&iacute;'s Law, named after Daith&iacute; Mac Gabhann, a young boy from Belfast who was born with hyperplastic left heart syndrome.  Daith&iacute; has campaigned vigorously, inspirationally, colourfully, loudly and really positively for a change in law in the North to ensure organ donation is on the basis of a soft opt-out.  This would mean we would all become organ donors unless we specifically sought to opt-out from it.<\/p> <p>To be fair, the heads of Bill and the general scheme of the Bill were published by the previous Minister for Health in 2019, I think.  Substantial time has passed since then and while I fully appreciate the impact of the pandemic, an update would be timely.  There are many wee boys and girls like Daith&iacute; all across Ireland and this list would operate luckily on an all-Ireland basis for all those who are waiting for organ donation.  It would be a welcome opportunity for us to talk about that specifically but to talk about the issue and its importance more generally as well.

We are all talking about the upcoming budget.  I was in with Mental Health Reform earlier, as I am sure others were, on its pre-budget submission and on what it wants to see in the budget.  I spoke to two mental health advocates, Blessing and Justyna, about their personal experiences of mental health while navigating the supports in the system in Ireland.  It will be no surprise when I say it was not a great experience for either of these two people.  It was not just a difficult experience for them due to the mental health supports but it was also difficult because of systemic issues, which potentially led them into a situation of mental health struggles, or the system not supporting them to live a life and be able to recover or go forward.  They were faced with issues around losing their home.  One was already homeless and the other lost their home while in hospital as the landlord threw them out and packed up their stuff.  For one, there was a language barrier and they were misdiagnosed.  They had to try to find someone to translate, to get a different diagnosis and then get back into the system.  There were cultural misunderstandings of their experiences with people saying their parents came here to give them a good life and effectively saying to buck up and get on with it.  There was, therefore, a real misunderstanding of what even led them to be in a mental health situation and how to support them to get out of it.<\/p> <p>Mental Health Reform's asks are not enormous.  They are actually very modest.  When we are talking about millions of euro, it seems silly to talk about things being modest but when we have a surplus of billions, not investing in mental health is such a bad business proposal.  It has long-term, knock-on consequences for not only the individual but also for society.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> If we have to speak in business language, then not investing in mental health services is a bad investment.  Mental Health Reform has called for investment of &euro;10 million for priority groups that tend to have a higher incidence of mental health difficulties, particularly LGBTI+ people, black and minority ethnic communities, the prison population, etc.  It is asking for an investment of &euro;2 million in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Some of our most vulnerable young people are falling between stools and ageing out of the mental health system because they are waiting so long.  That &euro;2 million would not be a large amount of money.  What Mental Health Reform is asking for is small in light of the affirmative and positive impact that it could have on individuals who are struggling with their mental health, on those who care for and support them and on society.  Many people are looked after by volunteers, be they their friends, families or communities, and that is not how it should be.<\/p><p>I was going to speak about another matter, but I will end there.  I encourage people, particularly Senators on the Government side, to consider Mental Health Reform's submission and advocacy.

This VAT rate is about jobs in rural and regional Ireland outside of Dublin.  We know about the gargantuan price increases in hotel rates in Dublin, but Dublin is not Ireland.  I wish to give Members a small insight into a particular hospitality establishment.  For every &euro;1 in food revenue, 45 cent goes on labour, 35 cent goes on food costs and 9.5 cent goes on VAT, with that last potentially increasing.  That is almost 90 cent of the &euro;1 gone.

In addition to poor air quality resulting in premature deaths, there are certain times that those who have respiratory illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and asthma are trapped inside their own homes.  They cannot go outside because of the quality of air in their communities.

This was where Travellers who live on halting sites, including that in the Owendoher Haven in Tallaght, did not receive the electricity credit because they have a single meter point reference number, MPRN, that all the halting bays log into.  In some cases, the local authority did not pass on the &euro;200 credit, while in others it divided it among the number of households on the halting site.

People working outside the HSE still do not know when they are going to access this payment and their employers cannot tell them.  The latest news is that there will have to be a tender for a company to organise how to do this.  There is no solution in sight.  The morale of those I know working in private nursing homes is at rock bottom regarding this.  We are coming out of a crisis, and heading into another crisis, and we have not thanked them for what they did during the Covid pandemic.  It is not just private nursing homes.  It is those people working in hospices and residential care centres.  These are people who never asked for thanks and yet we are withholding this payment.<\/p> <p>We need to think about this properly.  It is not good enough to say we will tender this out to a company.  Solutions are coming from those working in the sectors on how to overcome this.  As an example of how it affects them, they are already dealing with having to attract staff when they do not offer the same terms and conditions as the HSE.  When they leave to go to a HSE service, the HSE facility can secure the payment on their behalf just by getting in touch with the nursing home to ask its staff to fill out a form.  There is a need to meet with the sector to come up with a better solution.<\/p> <p>As we are coming up to the budget, I will mention the tax relief for people working from home who do not get the allowance from their employer.  They get tax relief of 30% on their heat, electricity and broadband, but that is not a refund for that 30%.  When they work it out, the amount is very small.  For 30% of their bill, they can claim tax relief on their taxable income, but that is only 20% or 40%.  It is 30% and then it is 30% off the 20% and 40% of their taxable income.  Again, we can do better.  We are in a cost-of-living crisis.

I want to praise Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, for coming out yesterday and stating that what leads to poorer outcomes for patients is sitting on trolleys in emergency departments.

One of things of which I am always mindful is that the HSE runs a national recruitment campaign for non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, across Asia and India almost annually and yet we have hundreds of vacancies across the disability and mental health sectors but there is no recruitment.

Nearly one year later, there are still people within the health service who have not got it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We cannot explain why they have not got it.  There are people in the health service who have got it twice and we are asking them to give it back.  I have never seen a good news story of rewarding people for their commitment during a time when everybody had to step up being screwed up so royally by the HSE.  That body needs to get its act together and sort the matter out because the people who will be admonished for it are politicians and Ministers, none of whom have any truck here.  They gave the money to the HSE many moons ago and it is not good enough that, as we face into what might be a very hard winter, we have not even rewarded people for their efforts during the last two years.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan spoke about another issue regarding money from the State that was not necessarily managed properly.  While I appreciate there is only one MPRN and therefore only one bill goes into Traveller halting sites, it is not rocket science to find a way around it and it is not acceptable that the &euro;20 million that should have gone to householders has been diverted and spent somewhere else.  I will raise that with the Minister and come back to the Senator with the response.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne asked for a debate on clean air strategy.  I will arrange that as quickly as I can in the first couple of weeks after the budget.<\/p><p>Various colleagues, including Senators Buttimer, Dolan, Hoey, &Oacute; Donnghaile, Casey, Craughwell, Kyne and Chambers, raised the cost of living and next week's budget.  I will send out the schedule tomorrow as soon as it is confirmed, but I hope to have two full days of statements from ourselves in the presence of our two Ministers so they can hear our responses to what is announced next week and, in many cases, our praise for the response from the State.  Any of us with concerns about things not in it or not up to standard can raise them at that stage.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney raised an issue that is probably not just relevant to the videos that went viral on social media last night and are reported in every news outlet today.  This issue is not new to Cherry Orchard.  The glee and entertainment value seen by all of our eyes last night shows this is a far greater problem than has been acknowledged and respected by the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a shame the Senator was not listened to in February because maybe last night the two guards in the car would not have been subjected to the treatment they were subjected by completely lawless individuals.  The people up and down that street who were videoing events, cheering and jeering had no fear, concerning their foul behaviour, of any actions in response from the State.  There was no rule of law in evidence in any of the videos I saw last night.  The Senator suggested that there was only one car available from what she described as a subdivision of Clondalkin, which explains the delay in the car getting there.<\/p><p>To put it alongside another community,  I live in a relatively quiet little town.  Very little happens most of the time, with the exception of one or two odd break-ins, which we have all accepted to be normal.  Three machete-yielding young fellas broke into our Tesco Express last night and within ten minutes two cars and an armed response unit arrived and the three lads were captured.  Compare that response to the response given in Cherry Orchard yesterday.  It is far more than an apology that Drew Harris needs to give.  He needs to provide an action plan to show a proper detailed response in respect of the people who live in Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot, a community that is as hard-working as any other and deserves respect from the policing force and to date has not got it.  I support the Senator in her call for a task force to be established.  I will contact the Minister for Justice this afternoon.<\/p><p>Senator Hoey spoke about Mental Health Reform and the money it seeks, which is small in comparison with the amount we spend on the overall mental health budget.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile welcomed the tender for the Narrow Water bridge project, which will hopefully be among the more successful projects in the Taoiseach's shared island initiative.<\/p><p>Senator Casey asked me to contact the Minister for Finance on retaining the help-to-buy scheme.  I will do that.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell referred to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth.  He also mentioned the AILG members who have just graduated from University College Cork, which is a welcome development.<\/p><p>Senator Kyne asked me to raise the lack of neurological nurses in the system.

Frances Fitzgerald, MEP, is no stranger to this House.  I thank her and Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, MEP, and Barry Andrews, MEP, very much for coming here today to engage with Senators who are coming in and will ask questions.  As the MEPs well know, as legislators, people have other committee work but they will be coming in as the session proceeds.<\/p> <p>I also thank former President, Mary Robinson, for her call to action: for the Seanad to be a leading voice in climate action and climate justice.  We have engaged with MEPs over the past year and a bit, and one of the things we heard back from them is that they want to have themes and to focus on various areas.  It is very appropriate, given Mary Robinson's call to action as a challenge to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the launch of Seanad 100, that we would look at that particular area.  Our MEPs and Europe are taking a leading role in that very important topic.  She wants it to be an everyday topic because it is affecting us every day of the week.  It is affecting countries across the entire world.  People are dying at this very moment because of climate change.  We in Europe - in Ireland in particular - must see what we can do to address the issue.  I came across a quote in regard to it to the effect that people want climate action and climate justice but they do not necessarily want to take action themselves in a way that would change the outcome that we are heading towards if we do not take the action.  The quote: \"The single raindrop never feels responsible for the flood\".  In the same way, we all have a role to play when it comes to climate change.  I thank the MEPs for being here.<\/p> <p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach is our man in Europe.  He takes a leading role in regard to this particular engagement.  I thank all concerned.

It is a great honour to be here today.  It is a great exercise for us to do this.  This is the second occasion on which the Seanad has invited us here.  We will, over the next hour and a half, be able to share with Senators some of the work we are doing on the European framework to try to tackle climate change, but particularly climate justice.  It is apt that the Cathaoirleach mentioned the former President, Mary Robinson, who set up the Climate Justice Fund, which had its headquarters just around the corner from here, and who is a global figure in this space.  Even today, there is in article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in which she expresses her continued frustration at the lack of global action on climate justice.  In that context, it is apt that we are having this conversation.<br\/><br\/>With the energy crisis and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it is natural that climate action has taken something of a back seat from a policy point of view if a person only reads the newspapers.  If that is true, then climate justice has taken an even further back seat than climate action.<br\/><br\/>I work on the International Development Committee of the European Parliament.  We are briefed almost on a weekly basis on the consequences of climate injustice.  This week, for example, I heard about the pastoralists who live in the area of Turkana, which is on the Kenya and South Sudan border.  Of course, they move their livestock around.  They seek pasture and places of water for their livestock but the rains have failed on four successive occasions.  The strong possibility is that the September-October rains are also going to fail, which is an unprecedented fourth failure.  The areas of pasture and areas of water availability are shrinking and the pastoralists are gathering in ever greater numbers in ever smaller concentrations.  This is naturally leading to conflict.  Many of these communities are armed.  There is also a huge increase in disease as a result of these concentrations.  Diseases spread from animals to other herds of animals that are being moved around.  This is the reality.  We read today in Mary Robinson's article that a person dies of hunger every 48 seconds in Africa.  This means that 100 people will die while we have this conversation.  It is not that we want to diminish the concerns we have about how the energy crisis is affecting us and our constituents.  It is not an either-or situation.  What we must be able to do is strive to deal with both at the same time.  I am afraid to say the European Union from time to time forgets about these key issues and about the principles of global solidarity that should be at the heart of the European project.  That is where we are right now.<br\/><br\/>I want to make a few references to the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 package.  This is the flagship legislative programme the European Union has announced.  It has created some conflict between the Oireachtas and the European Parliament and the European Commission, particularly the extension of the emissions trading system, which was announced a year ago.  A reasoned opinion was provided by the Joint Committee on Climate Action, as it was then called, of which some Senators may be members, to complain that the emissions trading system, as proposed by the European Commission and supported by the European Parliament and European Council, is a source of serious concern for this Oireachtas because it breaches the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.  Ireland is already taking major steps around carbon tax and ring-fencing the proceeds of carbon tax for climate action.  The argument is that the European Commission is diminishing the overall impact of that and this is an offence against the principle of subsidiarity.  It is an interesting debate.  The Oireachtas has a point to make here, and it will be interesting to see how the matter is dealt with.<br\/><br\/>I will refer to two things I am dealing with that have an impact on climate action and climate justice.  I am the rapporteur on the International Trade Committee for a legislative file known as the directive on corporate sustainability and due diligence.  Due diligence is the idea that every company that is caught by the proposal will have to check its supply chains and value chains to make sure that it is not offending against human rights concerns and against environmental damage in the operation of those chains.  In other words, those companies must ensure that they are not getting products from places where child labour is in use or that diminish water resources for indigenous populations.  The companies in question have to perform an X-ray on their supply chains, satisfy themselves and their boards as to the position and report on it.  That is the due diligence aspect.  There is also an enforcement aspect whereby any company that fails to carry this exercise out properly could be subject to civil liability.<br\/><br\/>This directive that is coming from the European Union is very interesting.  It will apply to all companies that are caught by it.  A company must have at least 500 employees to fall within the ambit of the directive.  I am arguing as the rapporteur that it should be wider than that.  I am arguing also that the types of environmental damage that should be caught by the legislation should be wider than is currently proposed.  It will be an interesting exercise to carry out.  However, I am also very concerned that the due diligence legislation does not imperil existing supply chains with developing companies.  If I am on a board of directors, for instance, I might just take a risk-averse decision and decide to close off any supply chains I have to developing countries where there are low levels of governance, compliance and respect for human rights.  I might close off all of those supply chains and look for products in other countries that are a little bit less developed.  That is damaging for the developing world.  We do not want to do that.  We want to take every step to avoid that.<br\/><br\/>The other area I wish to talk about very briefly is that of the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  We set up an organisation in the European Parliament last year called the SDG Alliance.  There are 25 MEPs from all different groups in the European Parliament who are members of the SDG Alliance.  We are trying to underline the importance of implementing the SDGs.  On one hand, we have climate action, and that is correct.  That is SDG 13.  All the rest of the SDGs give us climate justice and a just transition.  All the areas around poverty, hunger, education and gender equality that are in the SDGs give us a roadmap to a just transition.  We start with climate action in all the legislative packages we have right now, and the way to get there and to avoid the negative social consequences of climate action are the SDGs.  It is an off-the-shelf roadmap to get to that change we need.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, however, the SDGs, like many other very interesting international frameworks, have slid down the agenda because of Brexit, the pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis.  During the summer, we managed to get through the European Parliament an own-initiative report that attracted great support.  However, I would like to see Ireland play a much more prominent role in the EU and internationally on the SDGs, for example, by putting pressure on the United States.  It is extraordinary to think that only five countries in the world have not done a voluntary national review under the SDGs, namely, Yemen, South Sudan, Haiti, Myanmar and the United States of America, where the UN is located.  We need to use our good offices to put pressure on the Unites States to take seriously the SDGs and multilateralism.<br\/><br\/>I will hand back to the Leas-Chathaoirleach.

It changes in Ireland the way we farm, the way we build, the way we travel and the energy that we consume.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If we do this right it can be a good news story in each one of these sectors but if we prevaricate, postpone or kick the can down the road, we will have much tougher choices to make in the years to come.  <\/p><p>The takeaway message is that early action will be easier than deferring.  This theme came through the state of the Union address to the European Parliament earlier this week by the European Commission President, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, when she said very forcefully that there was a moment during the energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s when, if we had made the change towards renewables, we would not be facing the kind of challenges that we have now.  We have seen very clearly from Putin's murderous invasion of Ukraine that our dependency on fossil fuels is costing us dear and that our dependency on Russian gas in particular has led to real problems in homes and industries across the 27 member states of the European Union.  It is clear that there is a fork in the road.  We can choose the route of finding alternative fossil fuel supplies.  Indeed, European Commission officials are out in Qatar and the Middle East, looking for alternative sources of oil and gas.  While I accept that we do need supplies in the short term, we should be using this moment to choose the other turn in the road, to take the road towards more renewables, more linked-up electricity grids around Europe and more careful management of our energy supplies.  If we do this right, it will be a good news story that will protect consumers and householders from the very high energy prices that we are seeing at the moment.  <\/p><p>President von der Leyen saw this three years ago when she announced the European Green Deal.  We are all in favour of green deals but it now comes down to the actual legislation, the Fit for 55 package, which is around 20 separate pieces of legislation which, if fully implemented, will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2030 by 55% - hence the name Fit for 55.  We are all working on elements and aspects of this legislative package and every day of the week we face challenges and push-back from some of our peers in the European Parliament.  <\/p><p>The package I am working on comprises two laws.  The first one, for which I am the lead negotiator or rapporteur, is the revision of the energy performance of buildings directive.  That is a bit of a mouthful but essentially it is about improving the energy performance of our building stock because 40% of the energy in Europe is used in buildings and 36% of greenhouse gas emissions come from the existing building stock.  We know where we want to be by 2050.  We want every building to have an A energy rating.  Of course, there are exceptions for buildings that are part of our patrimony, for protected structures here in Ireland like the building we are in today.  We are probably not going to take out those windows and put in treble-glazed PVC windows because we have to respect that.  What we need to do is start with those who are living in fuel or energy poverty.  We need to bring those homes up to a much higher energy rating and in doing so we will save vulnerable people money on their fuel bills.  I have seen it happen.  Around the corner from where I live in Stoneybatter, and Senator Fitzpatrick knows this well, the older persons' housing scheme St. Bricin's Park has been brought up to an A energy rating and the transformation in the lives of the people who live there is incredible.  We need to roll this out across local authority housing and social housing, while also encouraging those who own their own homes to make that change.  I am pleased that here in Ireland the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is doing a lot of that work.  <\/p><p>Within the aforementioned legislation I want to see one-stop-shops all around Europe that give people impartial advice.  We are assaulted with advertisements and radio announcements telling us to buy this or that and we need clear, impartial advice.  We also need to rack up the minimum energy performance standards so that over the next 28 years, we get everything up to a really good energy standard.  This is controversial.  Some MEPs and political groupings are saying that the market will sort it out but I do not believe that.  I do not believe that people living in wet, damp, hard-to-heat accommodation on the streets of Dublin or Dubrovnik can deal with these challenges alone.  They need the European Union to help them and they need the legislation that we are working on within the European Parliament.  That is one aspect of my work.  <\/p><p>Another one of the 20 Fit for 55 files relates to greening aviation.  We are introducing what we call sustainable aviation fuels.  It is not easy to green this sector.  We are looking at biofuels and we are also looking at synthetic fuels.  We want to see higher targets for these synthetic fuels which are made using green hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a process called direct air capture.  It is very much in the laboratory and we want to bring that into production.  We are producing tens of thousands of litres of this fuel per year and we need to get this up to tens of millions of litres but we need the legislation that provides the direction of travel.  If we provide the laws then the market will follow.  <\/p><p>At this point, when we face both the climate and biodiversity crises that we have know about for years, and also the crisis of war on European soil and the crisis in energy prices that has resulted from that, there is a temptation to say \"Not now, wait until things calm down a bit\".  However, what we have seen on our screens this summer, with drought all around Europe and record temperatures of 33.1oC here in Dublin and 10oC higher than that in many cities elsewhere in Europe, tells us that the climate is changing.  We need to step up to the mark and we need to protect the vulnerable first.  <\/p><p>There are challenges in this transition and there will be dead ends and technologies that do not deliver.  We have a supply shortage of crucial raw materials, including precious metals, in Europe and we need to step up to the mark in terms of European production of these resources.  We need to have European semi-conductors rather than being dependent on Taiwan for these products.  The shocks through the system over the last two years have shown that we need to have more goods produced in Europe to meet European demand.  <\/p><p>In the past, the road was about building bigger and doing more.  Now we know we need to live within our means and this means we have to question a lot of what we do and move onto a greener path.  If we focus on both a just transition and climate action, we can deliver a huge amount that will help the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for a very inspirational address.

It is a pleasure to meet up with old friends and see many new faces as well.  We are all agreed that this is the defining issue of our time.  There is no question about that.  It has taken a while for everybody to come on board with that but it is definitely accepted now that we are at a particularly defining moment at present regarding climate change.  In a way it becomes easier as we see more and more the impacts of climate change, not just in far distant islands and far distant continents, but here in Ireland and right across Europe.  We have all seen the forest fires, the high temperatures, the flooding and the enormous challenges and that certainly brings it home.<\/p> <p>The recent IPCCC report is a reminder that we have limited time in which to take action to prevent the more devastating impacts of climate change.  The report, based on climate science, reinforces and builds on existing evidence which links extreme weather events to climate change, if ever there was a doubt about it.  We are facing a very difficult few months ahead with Putin's winter, the changes in the availability of energy and the associated costs.  This is making it all the more urgent that we act in a whole variety of ways.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Ms Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We saw from Ursula von der Leyen in the state of the Union address the range of initiatives that we need to take, such as reducing demand, decoupling gas and electricity prices, caps on the energy companies etc.  All of this will be needed.  The Senators will know the goals that we have and I do not need to go over them here.  They include no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, economic growth that is decoupled from resource use, which is an important point, and no person and no place left behind.  The whole question of a just transition, which I will say a little more about, will be incredibly important and is something that we have to focus on.<\/p><p>Both of my colleagues have spoken about the range of change that is needed in every area.  I am on three committees in the European Parliament, namely, the economic committee, development committee in the women's rights committee.  In each of those, we speak about the impact of climate change and the action that needs to be taken from many perspectives, such as the development point of view, as Mr. Andrews has already spoken about, and the impact of climate change on some of the most vulnerable countries in the world.  We know that climate change impacts on women and particularly on vulnerable women.<\/p><p>Economically, enormous demands are being made in every area, for example, financial services, the moves to taxonomy, being stricter and more careful about what we invest in and the enormous transport changes.  We have big transport changes to make here in Ireland.  The timeframes are quite challenging in the context of the pace of change that is needed in transport, if we really want people to move from their cars and to use public transport.  That has to be the goal because it is such an important area.  <\/p><p>The Fit for 55 package is the big area where we have proposals to revise key EU climate and energy legislation, in line with the new 2030 target.  It is interesting to be involved in the discussions, because people vary.  There is argument at present because of Ukraine, because of the energy prices and because the lack of affordable gas and electricity.  Some say that perhaps some of the goals should be moved a bit further.  People are nervous about doing anything like that, because it would mean that they are actually saying, &ldquo;No, we do not want to achieve that&rdquo;.  However, I have heard many colleagues arguing in relation to that, which has been a point of discussion. <\/p><p>Energy poverty is something we will have to look at seriously, given the reliance that we have had on Russian gas imports, such as in Germany.  Certainly, looking at it retrospectively, it seems incredibly short-sighted to have had that overreliance.  My eastern European colleagues would all say this.  Ursula von der Leyen said in her speech last week that we should have listened to our Eastern European colleagues, who were the ones who knew Putin, who knew what he was like and who said that we just cannot trust him.  They were clear on that and they proved to be absolutely right.  <\/p><p>I mentioned the just transition.  I have been involved in a number of the files on the EU just transition fund, which is important legislation.  It has a budget of &euro;17.5 billion, which includes significant funding earmarked for the midlands here.  There is also a public sector loan facility, which is part of local authorities being able to access funding for a just transition in their area.  That is up to &euro;30 billion in public investment to make sure that we have a just climate transition.  As ever, the European Union is providing the funding, but the point will be to access that, to implement it and to make sure that the support is given to those who need it.<\/p><p>We also have the &euro;750 billion recovery fund.  What has been important about that - and I have been pleased to see it here in Ireland with the Government&rsquo;s plans as well - is that at least 37% of the recovery fund must be devoted to climate and biodiversity spending and 20% of it to digitalisation.  The important issues in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il when we have that recovery fund available to us will be to monitor the spending of that and to see how those criteria around using the money for environmental goals for climate and biodiversity play out over the next number of years.  Just transition is a key point because all over Europe we have communities, particularly in eastern Europe, which are still dependent on fossil fuels.  We will have to create alternative opportunities for people in employment in local towns and local villages.  We will have to support the areas of retraining, the refitting of old buildings, the restoration of land and ecosystems, protecting biodiversity and restoring natural habitats.  It is my understanding that there is now a just transition commissioner here in Ireland with the values of a just transition to a climate-neutral Ireland and overseeing that.  That is extremely important.  <\/p><p>These are some of my key points on climate change.

It is a pity that all of the four of them could not be here, but we thank those who are here for being here.  Ms Fitzgerald is a former Senator.  Mr. Andrews is a former councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and was a Deputy there, along with Mr. Cuffe, where I represented the local authority.  It is great to see them all.  I thank them for the work that they are doing on behalf of all of Dublin and indeed all of Ireland.<\/p> <p>We as a country are so small in relation to the entire size of the European Union and we have much to learn from the things that are happening.  There is no point in us trying to reinvent the wheel.  I was in Hamburg recently, where I was looking at the energy consumption.  They are much more affected by the gas being turned off than we are, because we do not get our gas directly from Russia, even though the markets have been affected. <\/p> <p>I know that it is hard within eight minutes to bring up every issue, but  I did not hear too much about the whole area of wind energy, both onshore and particularly offshore wind energy and developing it off our coast.  We have a vast coast, much of which is relatively unpopulated and relatively empty and much of the time there are great wind speeds.  We need not just to develop that as quickly as possible, but we also need also the infrastructure.  We need to take the energy that is off the coast and bring it onto the coast, because we would explode the grid if we would try to bring that level of energy onto our current grid.  We would have to have an energy superhighway to bring that energy right into Europe and we need the technology to keep that energy viable.<\/p> <p>There has also been talk about producing hydrogen, batteries etc.  It is all new technology, but 20 or 30 years ago none of us had thought that we would have computers in our pockets that were more powerful than the gigantic computers that were in the Central Bank and the large institutions.  Technology will move on but equally, we need to bring all the people with us and to make sure that there are grants for issues like insulating attics, wall insulation and windows.  Much of that is going on.  We also need to find the labour and the tradespeople.  Mr. Cuffe referred to how many advertisements come out and how there are many people but we do not know who we can trust.  We and SEAI need to ramp up the involvement of production by reliable people.  Maybe the SEAI needs to go into a whole town or a whole estate and say that it is going to go there and that anyone who wants to sign up will get attic insulation, cavity wall insulation, new doors and windows and be done in a programme.  There will not just be a financial benefit to that, but there will be the benefit of living in a much warmer, less draughty, less damp house.  This can transform people, particularly as they get older when they feel cold and when their mobility may not be that good.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We touched on aviation.

Food and energy secruity has been mentioned by the three MEPs already.  I thank the MEPs for all they are doing there.  I think we need more of this type of engagement with the MEPs, not necessarily on a daily basis, as Mary Robinson said, but certainly even on a quarterly or a monthly basis.

The fears following the war or as a consequence of the weaponising of energy from the war of Ukraine, and the effect of that on families, communities and disadvantaged communities, in particular, is something that I would like to hear about from the MEPs in the course of this session together.  I am mindful of organisations contacting me about the issue.  Indeed, one organisation contacted me today to say that the cost of its gas contract is 2.4 cent per unit and it expires on 22 September.  Two weeks ago it was offered a new contract at 17 cent per unit.  Yesterday, the price had gone up to 22 cent per unit, and today it is 27 cent per unit.  This is an organisation that works in the community that supports disadvantaged families, delivers drug programmes, and helps the youth and young people who particularly need support after school, in building and ensuring they have just access in society.  In this context, when we talk about having to have an immediate response to this sudden urgency caused by the war in Ukraine, I completely applaud the need for us to change our reliance on fossil fuels and change how we consider and use energy, and everything around it.  In this beautiful room, there are lots of people using mobile phones that are charged.  Twenty years ago, they were not there.  We need to consider everything about how we use energy, as well as how we receive energy.  There are sectors of our society that are facing into an appalling winter.  Telling them not to use fossil fuels and not to burn turf is not going to be of any assistance to them.  They need assistance in the here and now.  A plan that may take five to ten years to bring to fruition will not give them the answers they need.<\/p> <p>I would welcome hearing how the MEPs are working to protect ordinary citizens and households, and voluntary sector organisations in particular.  How does the situation affect the green deal, in light of these escalating energy prices?  I would be interested in hearing about the MEP's work to protect lone-parent families, in particular, which are headed up, in the main, by women.  How do we keep a just society that keeps that equality in care in light of the current situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#KK00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Seery Kearney.

We are all talking about climate change today, and I would like to raise the issue of the energy charter treaty.  I would like to hear the views of the three MEPs as to where they stand that issue, and whether or not they support the call for Ireland to leave the energy charter treaty now that we know that the modernisation process has failed and that the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism will remain in the energy charter treaty.  Some of the bad faith actors are using the excuse that intra-EU disputes will not be taken to the ISDS courts, but we know that the ISDS courts have actually rejected all of those appeals and are continuing to prosecute intra-EU disputes.  I also note that last week, Poland drafted its own legislation to withdraw from the treaty.  It is particularly relevant in light of the fact that we have heard a number of contributions on climate justice.  Part of the modernisation process is to expand this treaty, which is a dinosaur of the past.  It was put in place to protect the fossil fuel industry back in the 1990s when we were liberalising our energy sector.  We are living the disastrous reality of that now when we cannot actually control prices in our own country because we liberalised energy.  This treaty is from that time.  It beggars belief to think that the EU is now pursuing the expansion of the treaty into the global south, which will leave those countries widely exposed to ISDS challenges or to chilling for any measures they try to take to tackle climate change.  These are fossil fuel-rich countries and they will not be able to make choices about whether or not to use those fossil fuels, because they will be subject to the ISDS mechanism if they sign up to this treaty, which is being pursued.  I would be most interested to hear the views of the MEPs on that treaty, and whether or not they will support that call for Ireland to withdraw from it.  We know that Poland has drafted legislation to withdraw from the treaty.  Italy has already withdrawn from it because it lost a case in the last few week, in which &euro;2.4 billion was awarded to the Rockhopper oil company because Italy tried to prevent the exploitation of oil and gas off its coastline.<\/p> <p>The other issue I would be interested to hear about, and again it is linked to the environment, concerns the undermining of the Aarhus Convention, and particularly the Irish Government's approach to the convention.  There is a lot of talk about nimbyism and judicial reviews delaying important infrastructure and housing projects.  I understand that the European Commission has very grave concerns about Ireland's approach to addressing this issue, and trying to prevent people from having access to justice and the right to participate.  Nobody wants to delay any projects going ahead, particularly renewable energy projects.  We need to fast-track them as much as possible, but we cannot sideline communities and prevent them having their say.  I would be interested to hear if the MEPs are aware that the European Commission has raised these concerns with the Irish Government and, if not or if so, whether they are going to take them up with their relevant parties and outline their concerns that Ireland seems to be trying to undermine its Aarhus obligations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#KK00500","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan, who is a former MEP herself.

Workers' rights is probably one of the areas where the EU has one of the proudest records and it has undoubtedly been a driving force in progressing workers' rights, particularly in this country.  I want to start by acknowledging the very important work done on the directive on adequate minimum wages, particularly by the European Parliament.  I do not believe that any of the three MEPs present is on the employment rights committee, but I know their vote was obviously crucial to passing it through the Parliament.  We await the adoption, by the Council, of the directive at the end of this month.  After that, we have two years, as member states, to transpose to it.  My appeal to our guests, as three Government party MEPs, is to urge the Government to ensure that we transpose this vitally important and transformative directive into Irish law in as full a manner as possible.  The record of success of a number of Irish Governments in transposing EU workers' rights legislation has not been great.  That is my direct appeal to the MEPs.<\/p> <p>Second, I wish to commend the work of the MEPs on the gender pay transparency directive and, in particular, I welcome the threshold of workplaces of 50 persons.  It stands in contrast to the legislation put through here.  I want to welcome the work done on that.  I also want to raise concerns on the platform work directive, which effectively has stalled at the moment, because of the attitude of certain parties and certain persons in the Council.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I understand that there is a reticence within the Parliament so we must ask the following question.  Can we stand by a situation where platform workers, which is a growing and emerging form of work across the industrialised developed world, are in a sector which is unregulated or these people are not recognised for the most part as employees?  Flexible platform work can offer wonderful opportunities to some people but we know for many others it is a route into exploitative employment and a form of bogus self-employment so we need the sector regulated.  We need the EU to show leadership in regulating this sector because, as we have seen here, the current Government does not want to regulate here and we need the EU to take up that mantle.<\/p><p>Yesterday, the Commission published proposals for the Single Market emergency instrument and at first glance the instrument looks very welcome.  However, by replacing Regulation No. 2679\/98 on the functioning of the Internal Market for the free movement of goods it will inadvertently remove the right and freedom to strike.  We must not let that happen and I appeal to the MEPs.<\/p><p>Lastly, the massive climate crisis that faces us now is on everybody's minds.  I believe that it is only with the financial firepower of the EU that we will make a dent in our targets.  I welcome the work that Ciaran Cuffe has done on the energy performance of buildings directive because it is only through improving the energy efficiency of houses that we can begin to improve the situation and narrow the inequality that exists between so many households across this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#KK00700","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":88,"content":"<p>To speak on behalf of Civil Engagement Group is Senator Lynn Ruane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#LL00150","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>On behalf of Civil Engagement Group I welcome our colleagues from the European Parliament to the Chamber.  This meeting is a really good initiative and is one of many needed to bring decision-making at an EU level closer to the people.<\/p><p>I would like to discuss the proposed EU corporate sustainability due diligence directive.  The proposal greatly complements my emissions reporting Bill.  Due diligence in respect of human rights and the environment along supply chains urgently requires a legislative footing but the proposed law would not apply to 99% of businesses that operate in the EU.  Furthermore, the law contains dangerous loopholes such as only covering established business relationships.  One major aspect that needs fixing is access to justice for affected communities.  All communities who have suffered human rights violations need to be able to access an effective remedy without encountering significant financial barriers.  I would appreciate hearing the opinions of the MEPs on this matter.<\/p><p>The second issue is the EU's migration policy.  Over the previous years we have seen a hardening of borders and the creation of what many term as &quot;fortress Europe&quot;.  One of the most startling accounts of these policies can be found in a book that I read recently which is called <i>My Fourth Time, We Drowned<\/i>by Sally Hayden.  I recommend that everyone reads the book if they have not already done so.  The book details the human impact of the EU-Libyan migration deal.  For context, over 82,000 people who sought refuge in Europe have been forcibly returned since the deal was signed.  The men, women and children who are forcibly returned to Libya face arbitrary detention, torture, cruel and inhumane detention conditions, rape and sexual violence, extortion, forced labour and unlawful killings.  Instead of addressing this human rights crisis the Libyan Government of National Unity, GNU, continues to facilitate further abuses and protect those using their power to abuse refugees and violate their human rights.  We, as Europeans, bear a responsibility for what is happening there.  This action is being done in our name yet we talk about the ideals of peace, justice and human rights underlying the European project in which we engage, which is gross hypocrisy.  I would appreciate if the MEPs address how they engage on this issue in their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#LL00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>To speak on behalf of the Independent Group is Senator Tom Clonan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#LL00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I echo the welcome of my fellow Senators for our MEPs and I shall make a number of short observations.<\/p><p>We are living in a time after emerging from Covid.  Little did we foresee that we are living in a time of unprecedented crises and, to a certain extent, unprecedented existential crises in terms of what might or might not happen.  The <font color=\"#202124\">Zaporizhzhia<\/font>nuclear plant, which is the largest in Europe, is currently being shelled certainly by one side but possibly by both sides.  We also have the ongoing threat, on the part of Vladimir Putin, of using so-called tactical nuclear weapons in his increasing frustration at the stalling of his campaign in Ukraine.  The response by the European Union as Ukraine is a country within Europe has foregrounded our shared values not just our shared interests.  Therefore, it is important that Ireland continues to give voice to its unique position as a neutral state.  We should also continue to do so within the context of the European Union and all of the structures that are in play there.<\/p><p>One of the questions that was asked after Brexit and Britain's untimely exit from the European Union was what will happen to Britain now.  That question has really been to the forefront of all of the discussion and our public discourse.  I think that as time goes on the following question will be asked.  What is going to happen to the European Union after Britain's exit?  This is a European Union dominated by France and Germany, particularly in the context of the conflict in Ukraine and, hopefully, in its aftermath.  Formerly, Ireland was a very important ally for Britain in the European Union and was often, despite what we might think, a very powerful voice for common sense within the European Union but that is gone now.  They were also a very important linchpin in the transatlantic relationship between the United States and the European Union.  While Britain is gone, and when we think about what direction the European Union will take, it is important that Ireland continues to have a very strong independent and neutral voice within the European Union.<\/p><p>I commend all of the MEPs on their work.  I hope that in the working relationship between all of our MEPs there is collaboration and that we can advance Ireland's interests as the only English speaking member of the European Union in the period that is to come, which will continue to be a period of continued instability related to accelerated climate change, energy and food security issues.

Again, it is all about implementation and without question the opportunity is absolutely enormous.  There is also the hydrogen area on which we do not have a national policy at this point yet last week a &euro;3 billion hydrogen bank was announced by Ursula von der Leyen when she gave her state of the Union address.  I think that the building blocks are all being put in place but it is about delivery.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney has raised the issue that is on everybody's minds at the moment and that is how people are going to manage their energy bills, and how NGOs and organisations that provide vital services are going to cope with the scale of demand presented to them.  The bottom line is going to be about the supports that we develop in the budget here in Ireland and the background funding that will be made available from Europe, but it is not going to be easy.

The very idea is ridiculous, but the stigma against the use of nuclear weapons has been significantly eroded and people are nervous about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#MM00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I apologise for suggesting Mr. Cuffe might be either literally or metaphorically at the coalface.

The future is renewables and energy efficiency.  I meet with my colleagues from around the European Union.  I have a frenemy from Romania who tells me I put 50,000 coal miners out of work.  I say I do not think I did it, but many of those workers are working in meaningful, cleaner, greener jobs now.  He agrees.  This change is happening around Europe and is a positive story.<\/p> <p>Senator Horkan mentioned offshore wind, which will be a huge part of Ireland's future.  That is why my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, had seven energy ministers in D&uacute;n Laoghaire last Monday talking about ramping up ocean energy.  It is happening.  We need more interconnectors, not just the France-Ireland one.  We need one to Spain or Portugal because the wind is always blowing somewhere in Europe.  If we can get electricity from where wind is blowing to where it is needed, we are bringing up the amount of renewables.  Long-distance interconnectors and the European super grid are helping us get to where we need to be.  We need bidirectional charging in electric vehicles.  I am working on that in the energy performance of buildings directive.  The homes we live in will provide the power for our cars.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney asked what was happening with the European Green Deal.  It is still there, as Mr. Andrews said, and has been amplified because we now have the REPowerEU initiative, which is about getting alternatives to Russian gas in the short term from Qatar and places like that and, in the medium to long term, ramping up photovoltaics on our roofs, the use of heat pumps, which have become a household phrase which was not there before, and putting in place the social climate fund, which will protect the vulnerable in the months and years ahead.<\/p> <p>Senator Boylan spoke on the Energy Charter Treaty.  It is a dinosaur.  We know that, and there is a meteor coming over the horizon called climate change.  If the treaty does not respond to that, it will die like the dinosaurs.  We need to tackle that.  I have not looked at the minutiae of what is proposed.  Many treaties governing the work we do in Europe are not fit for purpose when it comes to climate action and a just transition.  Fossil fuels have had their day.  If they had their way, they would burn the planet alive.  We as legislators have to fight against the lobbying that occurs every day of the week from oil and gas interests active in the corridors of the European Union.  During Covid, we had a blissful year and a half where the lobbyists were not allowed into the building.  Now they are back and it is as bad as ever.<\/p> <p>On Aarhus, we have to retain the right to information and to appeal. <\/p> <p>To Senator Sherlock, the minimum wage directive passed the Parliament and is down to trilogues.  It is hoped good things will happen.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane referred to migration.  We need to reform Frontex.  It is not fit for purpose, whatever about other instruments.  The pushback and money going to the Libyan coastguard have to be considered.<\/p> <p>To Senator Clonan, we have seen nuclear power being weaponised at a time of war, which raises serious questions about that technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#MM01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>We will go to Members' questions.

It is hugely important the MEPs understand that from a Dublin perspective this is what the people of Dublin want to see.  That is what they want to see delivered.  They want to see strong leadership from the European Union on this.  They want to see the EU really support Ireland in making its contribution.

My questions are really about the Midlands and the west.  Ms Fitzgerald mentioned &euro;17.5 billion.  Was there a phase 2 mentioned or something about that happening?  A recent amount of funding came through that midlands regional transition team, MRTT, group, which Ms Fitzgerald is probably aware of.  I have a quick question around that.  Is there a phase 2?

There are concerns there but I am very conscious that in politics, one campaigns in poetry and governs in prose.  The rhetoric we saw from the Prime Minister, Ms Truss, will be tempered by the harsh reality of the office that she holds.  I would be hopeful that the lines of communication will improve in the coming months.  Looking at it from the Brussels-Strasbourg axis, a huge amount of our time is spent on accession countries such as Albania, Georgia and Moldova.  These are countries that fervently see in the European Union democracy, freedom and help from their neighbours.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The kinds of values the European Union has spoken about is what they cherish and long for.  Many conversations that we have are about that.  We want to continue to be good neighbours with the UK and I have no doubt that the Prime Minister, Liz Truss, will spend time on improving that relationship in the coming months.  I hope that is the case.<\/p><p>Senator Flynn raised the impact on poorer communities.  It is absolutely something that informs a huge amount of what we do.  For instance, as part of the work on the energy performance of buildings directive, I am publishing an energy poverty handbook in ten days.  That is produced by working with organisations that deal with poverty every day of the week.  They are housing organisations and NGOs that know the reality of what high energy costs mean.  There are practical solutions that can be rolled out this winter to those who are feeling the pain of high fuel bills.  That work is extraordinarily important.  I would happily take up the Senator's offer to come out to Labre Park.  I was a member of the Traveller committee of Dublin City Council and have visited a lot of Traveller housing in the past.  I would love to take her up on that again.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about what Europe can do to help.  It is great to see the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, there.  I find it hard to talk about MARA without referring to the other Mara that would be familiar to those in Fianna F&aacute;il.  There is very practical assistance such as European Investment Bank, EIB, funding.  The EIB is now calling itself the climate bank.  That is a radical change of direction.  The biggest EIB funding Dublin received in recent years was for the third runway in Dublin Airport.  I do not think the EIB would fund a project like that now.  That is climate action on the ground.  It is now funding retrofits in local authority housing in Dublin.  There is a pivot happening there and it will continue.  When it comes to funding, the EIB tends not to get out of bed for less than &euro;50 million a day.  I mean that metaphorically; it wants the big projects that are transformative.  I see that across the board with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Central Bank.  Even the discussion we had over the taxonomy was working out what is green and what is not.  While I am unhappy with the result, there is clearly a direction of travel towards greater investment in renewables.  Offshore energy is not cheap but the return is clear and continues over ten, 20 or 30 years.  I have no doubt but that the money will flow there.  I also want to see it flow to renovations of buildings.  There was an attempt to set up an &euro;80 billion fund that Commissioner Timmermans wanted but I think he was outvoted.  I would like to see us revisit that because we need clear funds to deliver climate action whether it be offshore energy or renovations.  <\/p><p>Senator Ward mentioned semiconductors.  I met the high representative of Taiwan last week.  We spoke in depth about the challenges that Taiwan faces.  I think that the EU is a friend to Taiwan.  We are obviously rethinking the geopolitics of our relationship with China and clearly our relationship with Russia.  That work must continue in the years ahead.<\/p><p>Can we compel that investment in wind?  Not directly but we are compelling the targets we set down in the energy efficiency directive and the renewable energy directive.  That will push Ireland and other member states into more renewables.  In Ireland's case that will be offshore wind.  There will be more onshore wind, which is cheaper, but there is huge resistance to that and there are challenges there.  For Ireland, the wind speeds that we have are the envy of Europe.  <\/p><p>That more or less tackles the issues.  I am sorry I do not have the information to hand to help Senator Dolan but perhaps my colleagues do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#NN02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663680600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Senator Currie raised the impact of not having the Assembly in the North.  That is a huge issue and concern for all of us.  From a European perspective, and I am sure my colleagues will agree with me, we do see great ongoing support for Ireland for a proper outcome on the negotiations on the protocol.   We have all been involved in various ways.  Commissioner &Scaron;efovi is willing to be flexible.  There is opportunity to resolve it if the political will is there.  It is a question of having the political will, I believe.  It is there from the EU side and it needs to be developed further from the UK perspective, I would say.<\/p> <p>I recognise the points Senator Flynn makes on vulnerability and vulnerable countries, as well as vulnerable communities and individuals.  That is a very much a focus from the EU perspective.  Ultimately, it is about reaching out and understanding the particular difficulties that vulnerable communities are facing, whether it is from climate change or purely economics.  The funding being made available should be made available to those communities in all our member states.  We certainly have a lot of reports looking at various issues relating to poverty and tackling it, creating more employment in the EU and trying to keep innovation in the EU, which is a very big challenge now.  <\/p> <p>That brings me to Senator Ward's point on supply chains.  We have huge dependence on China.  We must work very hard to keep innovation in Europe and developing it in Europe.  That applies to Ireland too.  Too many of our innovative products are being exported very quickly and developed either in China or the west coast.  The relationship with China is much more critical than it was previously.  Obviously we try to co-operate where we can but increasingly, we also confront quite a lot, particularly on human rights issues and in relation to the Uyghurs.  It is a changing relationship.  It is one to watch in the coming years to see what exactly the dynamics will be as the EU tries to play a greater role in world politics.  We are getting a more independent stance from America.  While developing the relationship is very positive, equally the relationship with China is at a very difficult phase at present.<\/p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about the leadership we have seen on Covid and how we need to see it in other areas.  She mentioned small business.  Last week, in her state of the Union address, Ursula von der Leyen spoke about the late payments directive and how we need to change that.  In the case of a quarter of all businesses that go into bankruptcy, it is because of late payments.  There is an absolute need to update the legislation we have on that.  She focused particularly on small business.  I have said myself that in the coming period, small and medium-sized businesses will be very vulnerable with the increase in energy costs.  There was a good model there with Covid.  It is a different situation now but we have seen how we can reach out to individuals and businesses when we need to get them over a crisis.  That will be needed in the next few weeks and months.  <\/p> <p>Senator Dolan asked some detailed questions.  The Department of Finance might be the best place to get the detailed information on that.  I will certainly come back to her on it.  The funds are active but I do not have the information on how much has been drawn down at present.  There is a great opportunity there in respect both of the fund for local authorities and the just transition fund for the midlands.  I think &euro;89.4 million available which is a substantial amount for getting through the just transition period.  The two funds are worth keeping an eye on and following up on.  <\/p> <p>Those were the main questions asked.  I thank everyone for their questions.  We all have a lot of work to do.  What I notice more than anything is an impatience to get on with implementation.  The macro framework is there now and the macro funding is available.  The challenge will be in the implementation and making sure that we get all the players together at national and European level to deliver what are very worthy and necessary goals.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#OO00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fitzgerald and invite Mr. Andrews to the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#PP00100","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663680600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>To start with Senator Currie, the Brexit situation is delicate at the moment as regards the withdrawal agreement.  There was a very interesting comment today by Liz Truss, the Prime Minister of the UK, acknowledging there will not be a US-UK trade agreement in the short term.  This changes things significantly because that was the excuse given as to why the UK wanted to diverge on agriculture and veterinary standards, because it wanted a trade deal with the US.  Clearly, that is off the table.  It is to be hoped the US will now play a slightly more active role in trying to resolve the dispute between the EU and the UK.  I am slightly disappointed by the lack of US input into the resolution of these disagreements.  The US has traditionally played an honest broker role in Northern Ireland and I am disappointed with the role it has played.  The visit by the delegation of representatives from the US Congress lead by Richard Neal was a fiasco.  It was completely chaotic and added nothing whatsoever.  Taking the US-UK trade deal off the table is a very positive thing and it will force the US to take a much more proactive role.<\/p> <p>Senator Flynn prefaced her remarks by talking about the sustainable development goals, SDGs, and asking whether we think about the Roma community and the Travelling community.

I have been there before but it is a great idea to invite the Dublin MEPs.  I note Ireland will carry out a voluntary national review on the SDGs in 2023.  The country should summon together civil society, including the communities Senator Flynn represents, to make their contribution to the development and preparation of that voluntary review.<\/p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick talked about what was done by the European Union during the pandemic and it was very well said.  However, whether it is measures such as the digital Covid certificate, the Next Generation EU fund borrowing on a mutual debt raised by the European Union, or the procurement of vaccines that protected member states, we have not seen that on the energy crisis yet.  We have not seen that broad-scale, broad brush European approach to the energy crisis yet.  There is a meeting of energy ministers on 30 September and we will see if the European Union can find its voice on this.  I am thinking also in terms of joint procurement of energy, which is something that would really benefit smaller member states.<\/p> <p>Senator Ward brought up the question of China and I will convey his remarks to Clare Daly, MEP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#PP00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I am sure she is watching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#PP00300","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663680600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I am sure she is.

I will make a few general remarks by way of conclusion.<\/p> <p>First, I thank each MEP for being in the Seanad today, for making the effort and for preparing contributions.  We, above all audiences they will have, appreciate what their lifestyle is like.  Even at that we do not know how difficult it is to travel all the time.  We very much appreciate the fact they made the effort to be here, to prepare and to engage so fully.  That is not taken for granted and should not be.  It is important that is acknowledged because this process could not work if they ignored it.  We appreciate it.<\/p> <p>It has been remarked on by colleagues earlier, and I am not being patronising when I say, that we are extraordinarily blessed with the calibre of people we have representing us in Europe.  The performance of the three MEPs today, the acknowledgement of minutiae within Europe and knowledge of the entire workings of the Parliament and potential areas in climate justice etc. is incredibly good.  Dublin is very fortunate to be represented by MEPs of their calibre.<\/p> <p>The Cathaoirleach and I, with the excellent administrative staff here in the House, have been trying over the past year or two to implement elements of Seanad reform.  A very important element of that is engagement with the European Parliament and establishing that linkage.  We look to scrutinising secondary legislation in the future, but the engagement with the MEPs is a very important part of it.  There was a level of apprehension that we might not make a success of it on the basis the MEPs might not be fit to be here and we might not have adequate participation.  The contrary has been the case.  It has been an outstanding success.  I really appreciate that.  It is one important leg of Seanad reform.  The merit and benefit of this is very clear.  Even on a purely functional or practical level, a number of initiatives or matters raised by the MEPs in the discussion have been highly informative for public representatives in the House to bring back to local authorities, parliamentary parties and Departments.  That information has been vital.<\/p> <p>I agree with Mr. Andrews, who concluded by saying we should have a two-way process here.  It is very important that Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad would visit Europe regularly; at least once a year if not twice.  We need that level of engagement.  If it cannot be funded by any public bodies, we should do it of our own initiative.  I am certainly happy to do that and I think colleagues would be too.  We need to inform ourselves, to have that linkage, and to know what the MEPs are doing and the potential in it for what we are doing.  It is a very important linkage and that is very clearly established.<\/p> <p>Today has been an unambiguous and unquestionable success and I am delighted with it, as I am with the inputs from the MEPs and the responses in the House.<\/p> <p>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom &aacute;r mbu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il libh.

Amendment Nos. 56 to 58, inclusive, seek to ensure that the list of bodies with which an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s may co-operate under section 17 would include the Irish Research Council, the Royal Irish Academy and the Health Research Board.  As we have discussed, it is important not to end up with a siloed approach.  Science Foundation Ireland was mentioned explicitly, but other bodies have not been.  There is a very wide remit of research.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have highlighted in particular the leading work the Irish Research Council has done in a number of areas and the Health Research Board also plays a crucial role.  The aim is to specify that these would be bodies with which there may be co-operation.  It is better to have them named rather than just implied or hoped for.  In the context of a couple of them, the Minister indicated that there may be another way in which they are covered.  However, I worry about a tunnelling of our approach to research, as I have highlighted previously, and the neglect of some areas, including social policy and the humanities.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 75 is really important.  It seeks to ensure that local authorities and councillors would be persons or entities with whom an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s would consult for the purposes of preparing a draft plan under section 46.  In subsequent amendments I have tabled, there are provisions to retain the role of local authority members on governing authorities.  It is vital that councillors, as local representatives, have a say on these governing authorities.  I can give a couple of examples to illustrate why this is important.  Universities are not just educational entities or businesses; they are places and they exist within other places.  It is crucial that, for example, the role of universities in the context of local development plans is considered.  There should be correspondence between a local development plan, which is a vision for a town or city and the role of the universities and the vision for the moving forward of an institution.  In my own home town of Galway, the National University of Ireland Galway is a crucial part of the city landscape.  It has much of the land by the river and is really fundamental in terms of all of the collective goals of Galway around biodiversity and other issues.  It is really important.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, for example, University College Dublin, UCD, is one of the major employers in the area.  There is a very key relevance here and in that context, it is appropriate that local authorities and councillors are specified as bodies or persons with whom there should be consultation when preparing a draft plan.  They are included generally in terms of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s and looking to the general direction in terms of local authorities, but I want to specify them because down the line, in terms of individual governing authorities, it becomes even more important in the context of place-based expertise.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 84 provides that when preparing an equality statement under section 62, designated higher education institutions shall consult trade union representatives of both the academic and professional staff.  Amendment No. 115 similarly provides that in preparing a strategic plan, the chief executive of a university shall consult trade union representatives of both academic and professional staff.  These issues are really important and I have tabled a number of other amendments relating to them.  When we talk about equality, the question of economic equality is crucial.  It is acknowledged, for example, in the Athena SWAN charter, that in terms of gender equality, the conditions of work and conditions of employment, these economic factors, have a particular impact on women.  We also know from the Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality - and I am lucky enough to sit with others on the special Oireachtas committee on gender equality - that one of the key recommendations was the right to collective bargaining and an enhanced recognition of the role of trade unions.  This is a really key issue.  In the context of the equality statements and strategic plans, it is important that trade union representatives are included, not just for the academics but also for the many other professional staff who keep our universities and higher education institutions running.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 142, which is the final amendment of mine in this grouping, seeks to ensure that local authorities and city and county councillors would be bodies or persons with whom the director of the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, would consult for the purposes of developing a strategic development plan.  This is consistent with the points I made previously and is a provision explicitly relating to NCAD because it is covered in a different section of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#TT02200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome.

They feel they are being written out of the legislation.  In the case of higher education institutions, councillors have a major role to play in bringing to bear local issues and concerns.  What we are seeking here is that the legislation would specify a role for local authorities and councillors, rather than it being vague, which is the current position.  I fully appreciate that the Minister will probably argue that under the section as it stands, it is open to the institutions to bring local authority people in but I have spoken to members of local authorities and they feel more and more excluded.  They see more and more centralisation and are concerned.  They work hard within their communities and they deliver.  The Minister knows them better than I do.

They are the people who are on the ground every day of the week.  They can feed into this in terms of providing an insight into the views of the people on the ground.

These amendments relate to expanding on the names of the organisations and agencies that are listed and prescribed in the legislation.  I understand what the Senator is trying to do here and in truth, I half wonder if we would have been better naming none.  I take the point the Senator makes but I would respectfully suggest that if we name these bodies, then people will ask about Teagasc, for example, or some of the other research bodies.  I am not being flippant or smart here but there is such a breadth of research bodies in this country and this is always the risk when one gets into naming.  I am satisfied with the way the legislation is currently written.  Section 17(7)(b)(iv), specifically references: \"a body established by or under an enactment in which functions are vested by statute or otherwise relating to purposes connected with the provision of higher education by designated institutions of higher education and that is prescribed by order of the Minister for the purposes of this section.\"  I would make the broader point, which I have made previously, that we will have a research Bill coming before the Oireachtas next year, which I am really looking forward to.

We can revisit some of these matters in the research legislation next year.<\/p><p>Let me be clear on the issue of the local authorities and councillors.  As Senator Craughwell suggested, I know city and county councillors well.  I particularly know my party colleagues well.  I was a councillor.  I appreciate and value the role of our local representatives.  Senator Carrigy made important points about the on-the-ground knowledge of democratically elected people.  It is not the intention of this legislation by any manner or means to dilute or diminish in any way the role of our local authority representatives.  I will make the point that the Technological Universities Act, which any of us lucky enough to be Members of the Oireachtas in 2018 voted on, already made a number of changes in respect of governing authorities.  We will get to that section of this Bill later.  In respect of governing authorities, I am saying it is clear that when we pass this legislation, regulations will have to be set for how a governing authority will be composed with the new configuration.  Those regulations have to be put forward by a governing authority and approved by the outgoing governing authority on which councillors sit.  The regulations then have to be approved by me, as Minister.  I see a role for councillors and local representatives in that regard.  The regulatory process is where we will explore those issues and how best to address them.  There is a specific section of the Bill to deal with that so I will not expand on it now.  <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 deal with the section of the Bill that includes a provision that An t&Uacute;daras shall prepare an equity of access, participation and promotion of success plan, and who should be consulted about that.  I am happy that there is already provision in the Bill in that regard.  Let me clear that the provision will cover consultation with local authorities and, specifically, with local authority members who are democratically elected city and county councillors.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 84 proposes to include specific reference to trade union representatives of both academic and professional staff in consultation on the preparation of the equality statement.  I thank Senators Higgins, Ruane, Flynn and Black for the amendment.  There is already provision for consultation with employees of the institution under section 62(4)(e).  It is my view that this is perhaps a more inclusive way of providing for consultation with trade union representatives of both academic and professional staff.  There is also provision for consultation with \"such other body or person as the institution considers appropriate\".<\/p><p>I do not believe amendments No. 115, 115a, 115b, 115c or 115d are necessary as provision for the governing authority to consult on an equality policy of a university.  Governing bodies are empowered.  I am conscious of the debate around autonomy, about which we rightly hear a lot in this House.  We value autonomy.  It is about trying to get the balance right between putting the structures in place to empower a governing authority and allowing it to get on with its own internal governance.  I am satisfied that the provisions in the legislation cover all of that.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Collins, is going to take the debate about the next section.  Finally in this group are amendments Nos. 142 and 143.  They are similar to an earlier an amendment in that they refer to local authorities, city and county councillors.  I would make the same point again.  This is a specific provision in respect of the National College of Art and Design.

Those are not the same as having it directed by legislation.  It does not carry the same weight or include the same assurance.<\/p> <p>In respect of my amendments on trade unions, I would respectfully suggest that consultation with employees is not the same.  We know of many situations where a requirement to speak to some employees or a select group of employees mean a hand-picked group of employees is selected.  To consult with employees is not the same as consulting with trade union representation.  Trade unions draw their mandates from a large number of members in an institution.  They can consult and engage with those members around the input they are meant to be giving.  It is simply not the same and it is not a substitute.  It would be a concern for it to be understood that consulting with employees is better than, or a substitute for, proper and rightful consultation with trade unions.  We want people to have faith in their capacity to influence the decisions that affect them.  There have recently been worrying figures in respect of confidence in democracy.  One of the ways people get such confidence is for them to see a direct channel of engagement with their peers and those who represent them that will allow their voices to be carried forward and influence the decisions about the institution of which they are a part.  The Minister and I obviously disagree but I do not believe that consultation with employees is the same as consultation with trade union representatives.  The Minister and I may disagree on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#VV00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>In respectfully disagreeing, I would make the point that we have quite rightly included specific references to trade unions in many places in this legislation.

We know that concerns have been expressed about other boards, where there are persons who have moved directly from Government roles into the roles of these bodies which are meant to operate with a separate mandate and remit.

Under this provision, the chief executive officer will be able to tell a body that the funding it gets will be subject to conditions he or she specifies or sets.  The caveat I am trying to insert is simply such that where requirements are being placed on a body, that should be done with the approval of the HEA board.

Therefore, any public or civil servant who had been employed by the Government would be excluded from applying for the role, while anybody who may have been employed by the Government under a contract of or for services to head up a task force would likewise be excluded therefrom.  I get Senator Higgins's point about somebody who may or may not have had political connections, but that should not exclude him or her from applying for a particular role.

These are concerns that arise.  There are examples.  I will not name any examples in this context.  Concerns regarding close connections have been identified in the context of boards.  There is an onus to make these separations very clear.<\/p> <p>I referred to people being directly employed by the Government or a Minister.  That does not necessarily mean anybody who is controlled by a Department or public body; it means those who are employed by the Government or a Minister.  The Government and the entire apparatus of the State are separate.  This is sometimes forgotten or the lines may be blurred, but they are quite different.  I am concerned about the connections there.<\/p> <p>I have enormous respect for Senator Dolan, but on the idea of a strong person, I do not know that we want a single strong leader in the area of our higher education institutions.  We need to respect the diversity of expertise and insight that is there.  My hope is that the board will reflect that.  In the reply I was given, I was told extensively that the chief executive officer will come through the Public Appointments Service.  Of course, the board, which decides on the chief executive officer, is directly appointed by the Minister.  Therefore, we have a board appointed by the Minister making the decision.  I know that the Minister intends to choose to draw on the Public Appointments Service.  However, the Bill provides for the appointment of the board by the Minister and then that board determines the question.  That is why we need that separation.<\/p> <p>While I will not talk about it now, I will come to it later.  The concern I have about the consolidation of discretionary power with the chief executive is matched by my concern over the extension of discretionary powers for the Minister.  I worry that we might end up effectively with two individuals with an outside impact on our entire higher education architecture.  In that context, I press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#YY00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has said his final word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#YY00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663680600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663680600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 61 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 62 to 67, inclusive, 113 and 141 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

Amendment No. 62 specifies that the Minister will have regard to the United Nations sustainable development goals.  It is particularly important to reinforce that in view of the fact that, unfortunately, the definition of \"sustainable development\" in the Bill is not consistent with the United Nations sustainable development goals and predates the Rio Convention.  It is a definition from the 1980s prior to any understanding that we have of climate change, even though Ireland was one of the key negotiators of the United Nations sustainable development goals.  This is another opportunity to demonstrate that there is an understanding of the United Nations sustainable development goals in the development of the tertiary education strategy.  It is all the more important given the failure to reflect them in the definitions in the Bill.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 63 refers to section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act.  Again, this relates to the public duty in equality and human rights.  There is an obligation and an expectation that regard would be had to those.  However, I am trying to specify that regard would be had to the development of a strategy for tertiary education.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 64 refers to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Ireland has ratified that convention.  We know there is an extraordinary under-representation of persons with disabilities, not just among students but also among staff across our higher and further education institutions.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to consider that convention when developing the strategy for a tertiary education.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 65 again mentions the Irish Research Council.  I will probably not press the amendment because I understand that we debated the matter to which it relates when we discussed specific research bodies.  I will return to this in the context of the research Bill.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 66 provides that when assessing the demand for higher education at regional and national level and in each discipline, an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s would give consideration to \"the needs of society to address issues of poverty, social and economic inequality, racial inequalities and inequities and gender inequalities and inequities\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is ensuring that the collective public good needs, which are so crucial, are reflected.  There is a danger in higher education that we simply look solely to the demands of industry, for example, rather than what the public wants to explore and develop and the collective public needs around equality.  That is a way of giving practical effect to that public duty on equality and human rights and is an example of how that could be done.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 113 provides that where a governing authority is required to make a strategic plan, approved by a chief executive, that it would have the opportunity to propose amendments to it.  I am really worried by this.  It is really poor practice if there is a situation where a chief executive can produce a strategic plan and tell the board it must say \"yea\" or \"nea\".  It mirrors some of what we have seen with a creeping tendency in many areas of \"chief executivisation\" of crucial and deliberative processes.  I do not think it would be appropriate if, say, county managers were able to tell councillors something was \"yes\" or \"no\".  It is really important that when the board of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s is presented with a proposed strategic plan it is able to say that it is good in a particular regard but lacking elsewhere.  It returns to the idea that no single individual will have the full vision for tertiary education.  They need to be able to draw on constructive input from people who may have exceptional expertise in another area or discipline, or on good governance and insight into the growing trends and international expertise on students and their needs and participation, as was mentioned.  It seems like a strange omission where there would be such a binary choice for the plan for tertiary education.  If we are bothering to put in place a board of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, then let us make sure it can actually do some work for us and make proper amendments and suggestions on the strategic plan for tertiary education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#YY01000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat or, as they say in Hungary, <i>k&ouml;sz&ouml;n&ouml;m<\/i>.<\/p><p>I want to echo what Senator Higgins said.  The national strategy for higher education, the last iteration of the aims and goals of the higher education sector in Ireland, sets out that our universities should be the engines of economic recovery.  It was written after the intellectual and ethical failures of the so-called Celtic tiger, the crash and the austerity that brought us to where we are now.  It is really important that we set out in the Bill these commitments to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Sustainable Development Goals and so on because it is vitally important that our universities are not only engines of economic recovery, entrepreneurship, innovation and all those good things, but that they are also the engines of our ethical and social recovery because we do not have to walk too far from this building to find people in doorways and parks.  The front page of a national newspaper today has a photograph of a family in a tent.  This is symptomatic of the ethical and social failures in Ireland.  That is what a university is for: it is for speaking truth to power.  A university should not be the seamless extension of the establishment with its chief executive putting forward Government economic policy.  It is set out in the mission statements of Technological University Dublin and Trinity College Dublin that we must have a provocative professoriate who challenge the hegemony and the Gleichschaltung of the day which encourages things such as data centres and shiny tech industry but which does not give people a roof over their head or a place to live.  All these young people from Trinity cannot hold the modest aspiration to have a home and a secure place to live in which they can make the vital life decisions that will determine the future of this republic in the next 100 years.

There is now a university campus in Sligo, Castlebar, Galway city and Letterkenny.  They are in places that never before had a university.  They are now competing with our university centres.  We can talk about the soil and blood of the area but those technological universities have embedded within them the important priorities, particularly in areas in the west.

That is because of industries, small, local businesses, working with universities and having the potential to work with them to help them with their research and development.  That cannot happen if you do not have some levels of research and universities based in those small regional towns.  It is crucial that we fight for those technological universities and we do not somehow disdain shiny tech.

They need to look at how we will use technologies like that to support people living in rural areas.  I would never disdain that type of research and innovation.

It is not enough to point to the GDPR, given that the GDPR provides exemptions.  It is a question of how those will be applied and where the balancing will be.  Under the research legislation, perhaps we can revert to the issues around commercial purposes as they sit within research or partnerships.  We have seen some examples of poor practice.  Students are sharing their data with their respective higher education institutions, which are then sharing those data onwards.  It is important that we be clear around the purposes in that regard.  Simply saying that the purposes are within the functions is a wide statement.  The persons giving the data need to be clear on those purposes.<\/p> <p>I accept that this is a complicated matter.

For example, we had a discussion this morning at committee about the decision of the Department to take the testimony of survivors of mother and baby homes and lodge that testimony in the National Archives of Ireland in the national commemoration centre.  That is an example of a case where rather than outsourcing such investigations, had one been undertaken, to a senior counsel, we have teams of trained investigators in all of our universities and technological universities that can carry out this type of social research.  That kind of work needs to be explicitly articulated in the strategic plan.  If you exclude a students' union or students then, potentially, you debar a whole tier of students, for example postgraduate and postdoctoral students, who might have a view in this area and see ways where the university might tailor its strategic plan to the contribution to knowledge in areas other than the natural sciences or technology.<\/p><p>I reiterate that I do not denigrate those areas of investigation.  I wish to say that very often, human sciences and the arts are overlooked because of the overarching economic imperatives of the day or whatever.  Research students, postdoctoral students and the whole lot are part of a community of people who can very actively feed back to management ways to develop a strategic plan.  It would not be good if we did not have their voices, plus the traditionally provocative voices of the students' unions, which in the context of a university is a good thing and necessary for the vibrancy of the university.  So it is for those reasons that my colleagues and I have tabled our amendment to include both.

My fear is that if a governing body or the management of the institution interpreted it in a particular way, then they could look to play the students' union off against the student body or, if they sought a particular outcome, they might decide to go down a particular avenue.  I am open to hearing the Minister's response to the amendment but I think there is a point for replacing the word \"or\" with \"and\".  As a strategic development plan of an institution is one of the most important documents for which a governing body and management is charged with developing over a period, the consultation should be as wide as possible.

However, half of them did not have access to adequate broadband and a quiet place to study and only 30% received regular feedback on their work.  Over half, or 57%, found it difficult to study while learning remotely and this was linked to a greater risk of depression.  In contrast, the people who had more interaction with their institution, and the resources they needed to study, fared better.  The ESRI also found that over half of the women who were 22 at the time were over the threshold that defines depression, while from 2018 to 2020, the number of young men who were deemed to be depressed increased from 22% to 40%.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 87 seeks to insert a new paragraph into section 66(2)(5) provides that an equality statement of a designated institution of higher education, to which this section applies, shall specify the policy of the instituting relating to the ending of academic precarity.  Precarious employment in Irish colleges leaves many academic staff unable to secure bank loans, afford healthcare, find accommodation, start families or get above the poverty line, according to the Irish Precarity Network.<\/p><p>A group of academics, researchers and educators have warned that precarious employment has had, and is having, a devastating impact on the Irish education sector, as well as those who work on temporary contracts that range between three and 12 months.  There is also a large and growing number of people who work on an hourly basis and are paid a flat fee per class.  In respect of PhD students taking the Irish Research Council's stipend of &euro;16,000, for example, this equates to just over &euro;1,300 per month or &euro;300 per week.  If PhD researchers work a 40-hour week then that means they receive &euro;7.70 per hour at a time when the current minimum wage is &euro;10.10 per hour and the living wage is &euro;12.90.

This section would provide for a requirement of higher education institutions to implement, and report on their compliance with, policies of the Government or a Minister thereof.  There would be a direct requirement for our higher education institutions to implement, and report on their compliance with, direct policies of a Minister.  My amendments would confine those policies.<\/p><p>In Ireland, ministerial edict or a memorandum from Cabinet is not something with which bodies have to comply.  We have processes whereby Ministers seek to put proposals through the legislative process, either as primary legislation or as a statutory instrument.  They may be given power by the Oireachtas in regard to a policy area and the powers to regulate.  Alternatively, we have the mechanisms put in place under section 143, whereby power will be given under the Bill for the Higher Education Authority board to produce codes and guidelines.  They are all measures statutorily provided for in law.<\/p><p>This requirement, however, will not be confined.  That requirement for implementation and compliance, which is being placed on our higher education institutions, will not be confined to matters set out either through law or through a decision of the HEA board.  Under the Bill, as it stands, the powers will apply to any document of the Government or a Minister thereof.  Indeed, it is important to note it will not solely be the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, who is \"the Minister\" referred to throughout the Bill, but rather any Minister of the Government.<\/p><p>I do not see what is contained in the Bill to prevent this applying to any memorandum or policy document of the Government.  We know from our Constitution that the Oireachtas is the primary legislator.  The Government does not get to set policy without going through this elaborate governance structure we are putting in place with the HEA or through the legislative process we have.  We should not have a shortcut whereby a policy of a Minister or the Government can become something higher education institutions will be required to implement and report on their compliance with.<\/p><p>I do not believe this is intentional but it is significant.  We have created a significant jeopardy.  I have seen the Minister in many ministerial roles over the course of our time in the Oireachtas together, and I have seen many Ministers for Education come and go.  As it stands, we are providing in law that a Minister of the Government, or the Government itself, could produce a policy document and there would be this requirement for persons to implement it, without it having gone through the filter of either the Oireachtas or the HEA board, as provided for in section 143.  To be clear, that section is not an ameliorator of these sections, section 76 and others, because section 76 is not conditional on section 143.  I believe my amendments are very constructive.  I have come at the issue in a few different ways because this is a needless jeopardy.  I do not believe it is one the Minister plans to exploit in some nefarious way but I believe it is open to inappropriate use and overreach.  My amendments take three approaches.  They are all good-faith attempts to address what I think is a serious problem with the Bill.  One approach, which is similar to that which I took in the original amendment, amendment No. 111, would make it clear that the powers apply only to statutory provisions.  Therefore, the higher education institutions would have to implement, and report on compliance with, policies that have a statutory basis only.  Of course, that statutory basis would cover section 143 because that section will be legislation, so it would cover anything that might emerge from that section.  This is probably the cleanest and best way to address the concern.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, I have also included proposals whereby it would apply similarly to such codes or guidelines as have been approved by the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, effectively pointing to section 143.  While there should be a requirement to implement and report on compliance with codes and guidelines, they should be codes and guidelines approved by the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  If those codes and guidelines were approved by that board, that would mean all those due and appropriate processes set out in section 143 would have been applied to them.<\/p><p>A further, important amendment and concern relates to the fact that while the phrase \"the Minister\" is used in most places throughout the Bill, \"a Minister\" is used in respect of this issue of the requirement for implementation, and reporting on compliance with, his or her policies.  I accept the Minister will respond by saying this applies only as those policies affect and relate to the functions of the university, but that is very wide.  Of course, anything a university will be asked to do relates to the functions of a university, but the point is that individual Ministers should not be able to set policies and, unmediated by the HEA or by proper process through the Oireachtas, simply have those policies be something that individual institutions will have to comply with.<\/p><p>There is a severe risk of political capture and we need only to look to other countries in Europe where we have seen the overreach of governments in respect of the repression of academic freedom.  With all the due regards we have, such as mechanisms and industry needs to consider, it should not be the case that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, for example, can have a policy on what he or she wants to see coming through from a higher education institution in a way that might have an impact and whereby it might become a policy a higher education institution would have to implement or report on compliance with.<\/p><p>This is significant.  Good intent and all of that is fine but we need to strive for legislation that is clear and copper-fastened and this legislation has been drafted in a dangerously ambiguous way that creates unnecessary and avoidable future risk.  I strongly urge the Minister to take on board either the safety net of the HEA board or - I think this would be the cleanest way - my original amendment, which refers to statutory provision.  The phrase, \"statutory provision\", does not mean it would have to be law.  Rather, it would cover codes and guidelines developed under section 143.  That is probably the cleanest way to address this dangerous provision.  I hope the Minister will take this on board.  These amendments have been made in good faith and with genuine concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#CCC00700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>This is a large grouping, so I ask Senators to bear with me.

I had this conversation with some student union representatives.  I welcomed the president of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI.  We have all debated in this House, the other House, and in engagement with USI and others, how we properly address some of the legitimate issues and concerns that student unions have about ensuring absolute autonomy, ensuring proper representation and having absolute clarity about the rights, powers and definition of a student union.  People can accept this in good faith or not, but I have genuinely tried to engage at many stages of this Bill to try to define student unions and such in a way that has been sought for a long time.  I have received clear legal advice, which I put on the record of the House on Committee Stage, so I will not repeat it now.  The advice stated that this Bill is not the appropriate place to define student unions and an unintended consequence of defining certain things in this Bill would be to narrow the scope of what a student union does.<\/p><p>I suggest in good faith, on the record of this House, that we should develop separate legislation specifically about student unions.  We should seek to co-design it with student unions.  I am happy to commence that process with USI.  A full assessment with national and local student unions and other stakeholders would be required ahead of the drafting of the Bill.  It has come up too many times in this House, the other House and in my engagement with student union representatives.  The Oireachtas and Government have a duty to respond and to work with the student union movement to develop separate, distinct legislation on the definition of student unions, their powers, autonomy and so on.  I wanted to say that about how we should deal with this more broadly.<\/p><p>This Bill tries to increase the voice of students and student unions in a number of ways, whether in section 33, 34, 35 or 46, in the strategic development plans of HEIs, the equality statements of HEIs, or in section 143.  These are all places in the legislation where we have made a conscious and explicit effort to empower the voice of students and student unions.  When student unions and USI came to tell me that we had got the numbers on the governing authorities wrong, I accepted that because they were right.  We were proposing two.  While I argued on earlier Stages of this legislation that having two would have increased the percentage of students in all but one governing authority after the legislation passes, the student unions outlined the practical issues regarding postgraduates, undergraduates, and the diverse voices that they wanted to include.  We tabled an amendment and changed the draft law to increase the number to three.  That context is important.  There are specific issues that the student union movement wants us to go further on and to get right.  We have approached this Bill with that policy intent.  Where issues were highlighted about the composition and size of the governing authority, we responded by increasing the number to three.  That means that the percentage of students compared with the rest of the members will be higher on every governing authority after this legislation passes.  One would be forgiven for not hearing that fact, since I might be the only person saying it.  I will say it because it is true.  It is important and right.  I think it is a success from the engagement.  We will get to the composition of governing authorities in a moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#DDD00200","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>They are not student union representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#EEE00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>We will get to that in a moment.  I disagree.  That context is important because that is the policy intent.  On the issue of students or student unions, the definition of students set out sections 80, 90, 112 and 128 includes the student union.  The interpretation of the word \"students\" is a student or student union.  I sought legal advice on this.  The reference to students means all students.  This legislation means that the university or higher education institution has an obligation to engage with the student union or every single student in the university or higher education institution.  It is not a case of having a little hand-picked group of students who are not the student union but who the institution says it wants to talk to.  That is not the policy intent or the legal interpretation of the word \"students\" in the legislation.  It is also important to note that definitions are included in the Bill.  One states, \"&ldquo;representatives of students&rdquo; shall include officers of a national student union in their capacity as such officers.\"  The Bill states, \"&ldquo;student&rdquo; means a person registered as a student by a higher education provider with that provider.\"  It defines student union too.  Issues arise in this legislation which deserve separate, stand-alone legislation.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, perhaps through a committee engaging with student unions, could do good, meaningful work to bring that forward.  I am happy to provide the support of my Department on that and to work with people on it.<\/p> <p>I have largely dealt with amendments Nos. 80 and 81 during previous discussions of sitting county councillors and trade unions.  My answer on that stands, as do my answers regarding previous amendments.<\/p> <p>I come to an important issue raised by Senator Ruane.  Senator Higgins's name is on the amendment too.  It relates to positive mental health and well-being.  I acknowledge the good, important work going on in our higher education institutions to promote positive mental health and ensure that our institutions have appropriate policies in place to address this issue.  In this legislation, we have not, for better or for worse, set out all of the specific areas.  We have not set out many different specific policies, from student freedom to express views, sustainable development, ethical funding and research integrity, because the intention is to use section 143 of the legislation to bring forward those codes and guidelines.  My Department and I consider it more appropriate to address the intent of the proposed amendment through the implementation of the legislation.  The issue of academic precarity is similar.<\/p> <p>I come to the specific issues raised by Senator Higgins.  I thank her for raising these.  While we may not agree, I accept the way she tabled these amendments in good faith.  I do not doubt that at all.  I will not list all of the amendments because it is a long list.  These new amendments, starting with amendment No. 111a and running to amendment No. 139b, propose to amend the provision that the governing authority or body of universities, technological universities, institutes of technology and National College of Art and Design shall satisfy itself that appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place in order to implement, and report on compliance with, the policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government to the extent that those policies may affect or relate to the functions of the university.  The wording of this section was changed after engaging with the sector.  After talking to the universities, through their representative body, they sought nuanced language.  The original wording was, \"in order to enable compliance.\"  They specifically requested that the language be more nuanced and changed to \"in order to implement, and report on compliance with.\"  Senator Higgins was good enough not to suggest it, but this was not a view in the Department that we must include an issue about compliance.  We engaged with the sector.  It suggested that the wording of \"in order to enable compliance\" was too rigid and too far-reaching.  We amended the language to \"in order to implement, and report on.\"<\/p> <p>There was a good meeting with some Senators, including Senators Higgins and Ruane, in July.  Issues regarding the provision were raised.  It was a useful engagement.  My Department sought legal advice as a result of that in order to clarify the intent of the provision.  The legal advice is that this is not a substantive provision conferring any new power on a Government or on a Minister of the Government to issue codes, guidelines or other documents to universities that would place an obligation on universities to implement them.  I will come back to the term, \"a Minister of the Government\", in a moment.  It is still an important provision.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has every right to ask how our publicly-funded universities are getting on with our climate action plan.  No Minister can act in defiance of the laws passed by the Oireachtas.  That is the check.<\/p> <p>There are times where a Minister of the Government has every right to ask what publicly-funded institutions, whether they are autonomous or not, are doing to fulfil legal obligations that this country has.  There could not be a more important or obvious area than climate action, where the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, rather than me, has a responsibility.  The Government may wish to see how all sectors are getting on, including schools, universities or Garda stations, with the work that they need to do to be compliant.  That is where this comes from.  It is not unusual.  I think it is important.

The Senator predicted I would say those last few words.  The phase \"to the extent that those policies may affect or relate to the functions of the university\" means that the types of policies contemplated are provided elsewhere under separate statutory provision.

Three of the proposed amendments refer to statutory provisions, along with the codes and guidelines.

There is no statutory offence with non-compliance.  This whole Bill is built around comply or explain.  That is an important point to make.  This is a reporting provision.  I do not think it is unfair or unreasonable that institutions which have received large swathes of public funds - and will be receiving more, I am pleased to say - are asked to report on how they are getting on with implementing policy.

This Bill, as currently worded, does not.  That is a step backwards.

In the Technological Universities Act 2018, a student is defined as a person registered as a student or a full-time office of the students union.  There are different definitions in the Universities Act and the Institutes of Technology Act.  This is part of the challenge.  There has not been one definition in the sectoral legislation.  There are three different definitions.<\/p> <p>We are trying to get this right.  There is also flexibility, which is not a bad thing in respect of students.  Section 16(2)(d)(iv) of the Universities Act provides for either two or three students who are elected officers of the students union.  I know of students unions that might want their representatives to be chosen by the students union but not to be an elected officer.

Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin are not governed to that effect.  The panel the Senator represents in this House is not governed by the Technological Universities Act.  It stands over a situation where one must be an elected officer of a students union.  Many students who are delighted to be members of students unions and delighted to vote for the officers of the students union would also like to have a role in representation.  Many officers would also like that.  We are providing a flexibility here in allowing for a full-time officer or a student of the institution.  I do not think that is a bad thing.  I will return to this House in good faith and engage with the Oireachtas, and perhaps an Oireachtas committee, to see how the broader issues around students unions can be dealt with in other legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#FFF01000","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663680600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 80:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 57, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(f) trade union representatives of both academic and professional staff;&rdquo;.   <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#FFF01200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#FFF01300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663680600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 81:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 57, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(i) City and County Councillors;&rdquo;.   <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#FFF01500","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#FFF01600","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663680600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 82:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 57, line 26, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(g) plans to address local regional concerns, and&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#GGG00100","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#GGG00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663680600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 83:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 58, line 11, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#GGG00400","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1663680600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092000002#GGG00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"vote","time":1663680600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 9; N\u00edl, 21.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Tom Clonan and Gerard P.
