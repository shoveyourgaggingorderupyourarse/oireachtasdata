Our mission is to protect the public interest in water, energy and energy safety.  My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee to discuss our role with respect to the regulation of ESB Networks and, specifically, the CRU's role as regards ESB Networks' environmental obligations.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Karen Trant, director, and Mr. Robert O&rsquo;Rourke, regulatory manager within the CRU.  I will now provide some background and context to the CRU's role with respect to this issue.<br\/><br\/>The CRU's role as the economic regulator of ESB Networks and other network companies is to ensure that customers and network users receive value for money while the network companies earn a fair return on their activities to make the necessary network investments.  Those investments go towards the efficient operation, development and maintenance of the electricity networks.  The mechanism by which the CRU sets revenue allowances for ESB Networks is through a five-year revenue allowance process.  For ESB Networks this is called a price review.  The process involves an assessment of ESB Networks' expenditure over the previous five years to assess it for efficiency and to ensure the outputs agreed were delivered by the network company.  The current price review for electricity, referred to as PR4, runs from January 2016 to December 2020.<br\/><br\/>In PR3, which ran from 2011 to 2015, ESB Networks requested funding for the replacement of &quot;110kV and 38kV Cables programme&quot; and was allowed a sum of &euro;20.5 million for this programme, which included replacement of high voltage, HV, fluid filled cables.  Within the period ESB Networks spent approximately &euro;6.2 million on the overall &quot;110kV and 38kV Cables programme&quot;.  The CRU notes that a significant level of PR3 capex or capital expenditure was deferred to PR4, primarily due to financial constraints in the PR3 period due to the economic downturn.  In PR4, the current price control, ESB Networks requested approximately &euro;28 million capex for the &quot;110kV and 38kV Cables programme&quot;.  The CRU allowed &euro;25.8 million, which includes an efficiency challenge.  As per normal practice, the CRU will review the implementation and efficiencies of this capital expenditure on an <i>ex post<\/i>basis in 2020 within the PR5 revenue process.  That process is just commencing now.<br\/><br\/>ESB Networks is the licensed distribution system operator and owner and, as such, takes independent decisions to prioritise infrastructure investment based on its statutory function to operate, maintain and develop the network.<\/p><p>Given the statutory role of the CRU, we do not become involved in the day-to-day decision-making or management of ESB Networks.  Our role is to challenge ESB Networks to ensure efficient delivery of capital expenditure and ensure positive outcomes for consumers in continuity and quality of supply.  The CRU measures and incentivises its performance on metrics such as customer minutes lost and customer interruptions.  We do not specifically measure or incentivise ESB Networks performance in environmental outcomes.<br\/><br\/>The ESB Networks environmental reports provided by it to CRU, a copy of one of which we have provided to the committee, enable us to ensure that sufficient funding is allocated to ESB Networks to meet its environmental obligations.  ESB Networks has obligations which sit outside of the remit of the CRU, such as occupational health and safety and environmental obligations.  Our role is to ensure that ESB Networks has the necessary financial resources to meet those obligations. We do not have the legal <i>vires <\/i>to monitor or enforce obligations that fall under these areas.<br\/><br\/>My colleagues and I are happy to take the questions of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562626800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>What is the total amount of leakage reported to the CRU since the five-year review process commenced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070900002#K00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562626800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I do not have the figure before me, but we will provide it to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562626800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>That would be great.

On the non-spending, one of my colleagues may contribute further once I have provided an overall view.  There were significant reductions across the capital programme for ESB and ESB Networks at that time because of the financial crisis.  There was a very significant reduction in its capital expenditure because of ability to access capital markets.  In addition, capital programmes have impacts on tariffs and every effort was being made to contain any price-increasing effects.  At the end of the overall PR3, we reviewed whether, in spite of the fact that it spent less in capital expenditure across the board, the amount that was spent was spent efficiently.  That is our normal approach.  In broad terms, we accept that during PR3 there were significant capital constraints across the economy and the ESB was affected by that and, as a result, its capital programme was scaled back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070900002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1562626800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Would it be cheaper to do this work during a recession, given lower labour and material costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019070900002#K00800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562626800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Borrowing would have been required.

There was an OECD review of regulators and, by and large, the CRU came out with flying colours.  My experience, as a former Minister, is that one cannot act as a regulator if one does not take the environment into account as well as public safety.  If the legislation is at fault in this regard, then we must amend it.  One cannot act a regulator where one states that one is only an economic regulator and that one does not look at the environment.  That has to be one of the most valuable lessons of this process.  How would the regulator know what we are to do in respect of the climate?  If anything, in that three-way process, the environment comes first because the one physical certainty we know about is that we must stop putting carbon in the atmosphere whereas competitiveness or security can be devised in a range of different ways.  To discount the environment and state that one is only an economic regulator, is a valuable lesson out of what has come out today.

There was agreement and unanimity that the report would be circulated and that we would agree amendments on Monday.  I can understand where Deputy Michael McGrath is coming from.  I naively thought that there was a majority view in this committee that sales to vulture funds should not happen without the consent of borrowers.  However, I now see clearly that Deputy McGrath's amendment is about scuttling this Bill.  That is what it is.  Let us call it as it is.  It is about scuttling this Bill and ensuring it does not go through.  If the Deputy does not support the principle of no consent, no sale he should say it outright, because the amendment he has placed before this committee is about making sure that this Bill never sees the light of day.  It is a stalling tactic.  He knows the clock is ticking for this year and he also knows, as do other members of the committee, that banks are lining up many vulture sales of family homes.  They are looking to us to act, and I am very disappointed.

We are getting into discussion of the amendments themselves at this point, but as far as we are concerned, this is not a political game.  It is about getting the right outcome for the country, for mortgage holders, and for our financial system as well.  That is why the evidence that has been given has to be tested.  None of the people proposing the Bill should fear their assertions being tested in an independent and time-bound manner.  That is what we are suggesting.

If the Deputy stalls this Bill for another three or four months, we will run out of time to bring this legislation in.  I give the Deputy the opportunity to show his bona fides by allowing this Bill to go to Committee Stage, but not taking Committee Stage until the independent analysis is done.

I believe it will pose the greatest of difficulties for those who are paying mortgages at the moment because of what could happen to their mortgages in the future, and the rates of interest on their mortgages.<\/p><p>At a time when the economy, small companies and families need credit, including citizens who need credit to buy homes, this Bill, if passed, could have a highly detrimental effect on the ability to supply new rates of credit to the economy at affordable rates of interest.  Given the number of times this committee has acknowledged the need for strong, independent regulators, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Ireland raise a variety of profound concerns in respect of this Bill and, perhaps most significantly from a Central Bank point of view, indicate that if our banking system was to ever get into difficulty, the passage of this Bill could affect the ability of the Central Bank to support Irish banks in times of difficulty.  That is the gravest of issues to be raised in respect of any Bill like this one.  It is for all of those reasons that I oppose the Bill, which will not come as a surprise to Deputy Doherty.  I want to ensure that people get treated fairly and those who are in debt distress are supported.  I also have a duty to people who depend on our banks for credit and affordable mortgages.  This Bill does not recognise the need to find that balance.<\/p><p> From a process point of view, I am eager to get the Chairman's guidance regarding how he wants to move this forward.  In that regard, I will simply say that if the Government treated any member of the Opposition in the way I believe this committee has been treated in having two different reports issued on one day or if I, as a member of the Government, attempted to treat this committee like that, the committee would be apoplectic with me, and understandably so.  We are not talking about slightly different reports being issued.  They are materially different and they require materially different amendments that would have very different consequences in respect of what the D&aacute;il could do.  For those reasons, I believe this Bill should not proceed to Committee Stage.

In terms of the  change in the report, I believe the deadline should have reflected that.  I fundamentally disagree with what this Bill proposes but on the procedural side, we required further time.  If one reads through the report, one can see it has been changed significantly in various areas.  Members were not given sufficient time.  Yesterday's 12 noon deadline was grossly inadequate considering the magnitude of the topic we are dealing with.  Our role as a committee is to scrutinise issues in great depth.

That draft was to reflect the views expressed by two other groups of witnesses who appeared before the committee.  I changed my opening remarks in the report because I wanted to change them.  Other parts of the report were added to and new parts inserted.<\/p><p>It was up to the members then to take that draft - it is only a second draft - and to decide on the changes that they want.  They could come back here today and decide that they do not want to do it this week and we will postpone it until next week.  That would have been fine.  The reason we are caught in this time issue is because I presumed we were coming in to look at the amendments which I did not expect to be as complex as they are, but given that they are, we do not have the time to deal with it and it is a matter of postponing the consideration of those amendments and of the report itself to another date.  The amendments are extensive and need consideration but it is in the hands of the members to decide.  They are to decide what to do.  If the decision is to postpone this and debate it on another day, which can be tomorrow, after the break, or whenever, the members can make that decision.

First, on what the Minister said regarding who needs to be present in this debate, his point is correct.  I have been present for all of this debate.  If the Minister was in attendance at the debate, he would have heard the Central Bank state that dealing with the issue of securitisation allays the majority of its concerns.  That is first and foremost.  It has been repeated time and again that the drafting of the Bill is not intended to have an impact on the issue of securitisation and that it would be amended or the position clarified on Committee Stage.  The Minister can throw out accusations that I am reckless, not aware of potential consequences and all the rest and state that the Department is paying for this.  That is fine.  I am sure we could ask that an independent analysis be carried out in respect of the effect vulture funds have had on people who have lost their homes.  Perhaps he would not be so willing to have such an analysis.<\/p> <p>  With that parked to one side, the question is how we find a way forward.  As stated, I do not fear anything in the context of testing this.  However, it has been months since this passed the D&aacute;il and we have had a process of scrutiny in regard to it.  The concern I have is that the independent analysis is linked to allowing this to proceed to Committee Stage.  I have no problem with the proposal from Deputy Michael McGrath to the effect that the committee agree to an independent analysis and we can look at the type of analysis we carry out, which is something I would support.  However, I would also ask the committee to allow this Bill to move to Committee Stage on the understanding that it will not proceed further until the independent analysis has been completed and we have had time to reflect on it in order that we might shape whatever amendments we wish to bring forward in respect of the report.<\/p> <p>  Otherwise, and let us call a spade a spade.  What is happening here is about scuttling the Bill.  That is the reality.  There is a divergence of opinion and, obviously, Fine Gael has stated clearly and consistently that it is opposed to this Bill.  That is its entitlement.  We can do two things.  We can agree to carry out an independent analysis, within a timeframe of two months to look at what the analysis needs to cover.  Deputy Michael McGrath has captured much of that.  We can also complete this report, which would allow us to report to the D&aacute;il with a recommendation that we proceed to Committee Stage, on the understanding that Committee Stage will not happen until the independent analysis, which allows us to be more informed, has been completed.<\/p> <p>  The independent analysis is post scrutiny.

A select committee cannot make its decision based on these five points unless it has the report.  For example, we could make a decision to consider the report in full next Tuesday or any other day this week.  It would be whenever the members decided.  Once that was done, we could proceed with finalising the report.  The select committee needs that report to make its decision.  From a procedural point of view, that is the way forward.  If members agree, we could begin the process of completing the analysis that the Minister referenced while that work was being done.  As such, it would not hold up the process.  It would allow us to get into perfecting the report for the select committee.  That is the only decision that we have to make.  There is no final report - it is a draft report, which can be changed by anyone on the committee and agreed by us all.  We still have to make that report.

He is entitled to the opinion he holds in respect of the Bill.  I have a different opinion.  I want the Bill to proceed, although it does need to be amended.<\/p> <p>  On Thursday, the select committee will take Committee Stage of another piece of my legislation on insurance contracts.  There is further analysis needed on the part of the Department of Finance regarding that Bill but there is reasonableness in the approach of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, in respect of the Bill.  We have agreed that the Bill to which I refer will go to Committee Stage.  If it passes Committee Stage, it will fall to Sinn F&eacute;in to take Report Stage in its Private Members' time.  I will not take it to Report Stage until that analysis has been done.  We work together to get things done.  That is the approach we should be taking in this committee.  The reality is that for some members here this Bill has proceeded further than they expected.  There is no money message required.  The legal opinion is that it is not unconstitutional and, therefore, it now falls into the laps of Deputies and Senators to decide which side they are on and how we balance all of this.<\/p> <p>  There are issues in terms of timing and delays.  The Bills Office has to make a final determination, which it cannot do until scrutiny is done and the report is laid.  If we do not lay a report until September, the Bill is further stalled.  Scrutiny is completed.  If we wanted an independent analysis we should have asked for it three months ago.  I do not mind if we have an independent analysis.  I have nothing to fear in that regard.  In terms of scrutiny, we agreed on witnesses, who should give written statements and who should come before us and so on.  We now have an obligation to report.  The fundamental problem is in regard to progress to the next Stage, which is Committee Stage, which we all know is where the principles of the Bill are dissected and amended, some of it fundamentally and some of it in a minor way.  I agree that we should have the independent analysis before that but what is being proposed here is that this Bill cannot progress until the independent analysis is complete.  I do not accept that.  I think that it is wrong.  It is a cute way of trying to scuttle the Bill while at the same time trying to sound reasonable because certain members do not want to be the ones who are blamed for doing nothing while thousands of people are being thrown to the wolves in the form of banks selling to the vultures. <\/p> <p>  Let us finish the scrutiny, following which a report will be produced.  The scrutiny can make recommendations in regard to the Bill.  By the way, the three observations by the Minister are only his observations.  They are not my view and they are not the view of the legal team either in terms of issues being unsurmountable.  There is a key issue here.<\/p><p>We need to lay it before the House.  The memorandum of understanding clearly states that the scrutiny report may make recommendations on, for example, what should be amended on Committee Stage.  That is why I have argued that the issue of securitisation needs to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  It also allows the Minister to recommend an independent analysis, which is fair.  The problem is that the Minister is suggesting there be no more progress on the Bill until that analysis has been completed.  In my view, the reason is that he wishes to stop the Bill now rather than at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019070900002#K00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562626800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>The scrutiny is not completed until we have finished and agreed a report.

It has and will continue to invest significant time and resources in doing so.  I have provided an opening statement and propose to run through it in summary form. <br\/><br\/>By way of background, we have been actively involved in the Government's cost of insurance working group.  Commissioner Harris has met the Minister of State<b><\/b>at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, on a number of occasions.  Also, senior officers from the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau have actively engaged with industry groups and individual companies for several years.  I am joined here today by Chief Superintendent Pat Lordan who is in charge of the bureau and leads our work in the area.<br\/><br\/>For our part, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is focused on identifying anyone involved in the making of bogus insurance claims and to maximise the potential to initiate prosecutions.  We believe that the best way of doing this is through a co-ordinated approach on a countrywide basis.  This can best be seen from recent activity under Operation Coatee.  We launched the operation in April of this year and it is focused on the prevention and detection of insurance related fraud and associated crimes.  Recently we had a specific day of action that focused on more than 20 insurance claims that we believed may be fraudulent and which, in some cases, had already involved payment being made to claimants.  Investigations carried out by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau indicate that a number of targets in this operation have submitted multiple claims and in many circumstances while using false identities.  The suspected bogus claims result from false claims of injury sustained through slips and falls.  During the course of the searches additional evidence was gathered with a view to submitting files to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The detectives from GNECB also seized high-value cars and jewellery worth more than &euro;300,000 along with a substantial amount of documentation and financial records.  Additionally, on the same day, a number of search warrants were executed at other locations.  All evidence gathered on the day of action continues to be analysed as we speak.<br\/><br\/>On an ongoing basis we work to continue to make improvements to our processes, systems and resourcing.  Working closely with Insurance Ireland, updated guidelines for insurance entities on how to report insurance fraud to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were developed, co-signed and published by the GNECB last year. <br\/><br\/>In October 2018, the Police Using Leading Systems Effectively, PULSE, was updated and insurance fraud and other categories of economic crime were introduced as separate crime categories.  This will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to monitor trends in the area of economic crime and plan an appropriate response.  <br\/><br\/>At meetings between Commissioner Harris and the Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy, both parties agreed that private funding of a specialist insurance fraud unit was not the preferred option.  However, discussions have commenced on possible opportunities to provide additional support in the areas of IT software, training and analysis.  Commissioner Harris has also informed the Minister of State that, in line with the overall Garda strategy, the GNECB will focus on major organised frauds, including insurance cases and individual insurance frauds at the centre, and the more complicated investigations will be conducted by the national unit while divisional units will focus on the less complicated cases with either support from the national unit or additional training being provided to them.  <br\/><br\/>This division-led approach that we talk about is currently being trialled as part of our divisional policing model that is being rolled out in four Garda divisions around the country.<\/p><p>In addition, the national unit will co-ordinate all ongoing investigations throughout the country.  As the work is ongoing, we can begin to get an idea of the information available and the extent of ongoing investigations.<\/p><p> It is important that there be sufficient expertise at divisional level.  This year an additional 50 garda&iacute; have been trained.  In the past two years over 130 have been trained throughout the country.  An additional six sergeants and six garda&iacute; were provided for the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau to work in this and other areas related to fraud.  We will extend the competition for places in the bureau and expect it to be run in the second half of the year, with additional resources provided for Chief Superintendent Patrick Lordan and his team.  In the meantime, we continue to develop in-house expertise in investigating insurance related fraud and provide training for the additional garda&iacute;, detective garda&iacute; and detective sergeants.  They receive fraud training as part of their induction training.  Throughout the course experienced fraud investigators provide presentations on both legislation and fraud investigation techniques relevant to economic crime investigations, including the investigation of insurance related fraud.  Representatives from the private sector, including the insurance industry, are also invited to contribute to the course, thereby providing specialist insight into relevant insurance sector related topics.<\/p><p> The report on the cost of motor insurance recognises that preventing insurance fraud is not the responsibility of one party alone.  This was re-emphasised at the fraud round-table discussion hosted by the Department of Finance.  At the discussion An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na committed to engaging closely with the insurance industry and meet regularly with Insurance Ireland's anti-fraud forum to discuss and act on ongoing issues.  The enhanced co-operation will be very important in the future.<\/p><p> I will conclude by reiterating my opening comments.  I reassure members of the committee, the insurance industry and the members of the public watching that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deal with insurance related fraud and that we continue to take this matter very seriously.  I re-emphasise the importance of insurance companies and individuals reporting potential fraud to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I said, we are determined to identify insurance fraudsters and seek their prosecution.  We commit to doing everything possible to achieve that objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019070900002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twomey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562626800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Twomey and Mr. Lordan.

First, the proposal was for a privately funded insurance unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wants to provide a policing service to all members of the public, not just those who provide funding.  We believe our obligation is to provide the service that is needed and not necessarily a service just to those who come forward and pay.  That is as much an ethical issue as anything else.  We in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to police the country and we will meet the demands, whatever they are.<\/p> <p>  This leads me to the second point.  We apply resources depending on the demand.  We are satisfied that there are sufficient resources to deal with the demands we have talked about or the number of claims we have talked about.  As I said at the outset, this area of demand is not the largest of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  The chief superintendent dedicates the resources in that area.  Resources are constantly kept under review.  I talked about the additional resources that would be provided before the end of the year.  These are constantly under review.  The chief superintendent, through his assistant commissioner, will come to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and make a business case for additional resources.  That is why the decision has been taken that somewhere in the region of 35 to 50 additional personnel will be provided to the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau between now and the end of the year.  This is to meet the demand that the chief superintendent has identified.  I refer to the number we are satisfied are required to meet the additional demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019070900002#Q00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twomey"},{"type":"speech","time":1562626800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>On insurance fraud, a figure was given of 1,500 to 2,000 over the past three years.

It is important to try to understand the structure we use.  We have a national unit that sits at the centre.  It deals with the more complex cases.  There may be an international element or various strands that involve people throughout the country.  In these types of cases, the chief superintendent and his team will direct and lead.  They will provide assistance and expertise to a chief superintendent or superintendent at a divisional level in the less complicated cases.  The more straightforward ones are investigated by individual detective sergeants or detective garda&iacute;.  All of our detective sergeants and detective garda&iacute; are trained on fraud.  They get basic training on fraud.  Over recent years, in the region of 180 garda&iacute; have got specific training on insurance related fraud.  Therefore, we have a tiered response.  We have detective garda&iacute; at the basic level.  At the next level, the figure is in the region of 180.

I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to discuss with the committee the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (Specified Bodies) Regulations 2019.  My officials have provided committee members with briefing material for use at this meeting.<\/p><p>These regulations will support an important anti-money laundering measure, the central register of beneficial ownership, which will identify who is behind a corporate entity.  The regulations prescribe the new position of registrar of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies as a specified body for the purposes of Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  This will enable the registrar to collect personal public service numbers to verify the identity of persons who have ultimate control of a company, ensuring that the central register is accurate, and to prevent individuals who would think of trying to conceal their identity for the purpose of money laundering or financing terrorism from doing so.  The PPSN will not be visible to the registrar, staff within the registry of beneficial ownership or any member of the public.  The PPSN will never be shared with any State or non-State competent authorities or with any third party.<\/p><p>Members will be aware of company law and the concept of directors of a company.  A beneficial owner is the natural person who ultimately owns or controls a legal entity through direct or indirect ownership or through control via other means.  Thus, simply because someone is a director on paper does not mean in practice that the person ultimately controls the company.  Recital 25 of the EU fourth anti-money laundering directive highlights the importance of beneficial ownership information.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The need for accurate and up-to-date information on the beneficial owner is a key factor in tracing criminals who might otherwise be able to hide their identity behind a corporate structure.  The globally interconnected financial system makes it possible to hide and move funds around the world, and money launderers and terrorist financers as well as other criminals have increasingly made use of that possibility.<\/blockquote> <p>To prevent this criminality the EU fourth and fifth anti-money laundering directives, also known as 4 and 5 AMLD, legally oblige Ireland to establish and maintain a central register of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies.  This central register, known as the RBO, is the first in a series.  Others are currently being finalised for trusts and for Irish collective asset management vehicles or ICAVs.  Crucially, Article 30(4) of 4 AMLD means there is an EU law obligation on Ireland to ensure that the central register is accurate.<\/p><p>PPSN use is seen as critical to the success of the RBO as it will prevent multiple variations of the same person's details from being entered in the register.  While a mechanism will be in place for beneficial owners who do not have a PPSN, the vast majority of beneficial owners already have a PPSN, particularly for tax purposes.  A practical example of why such verification is needed is the charity Console.  In 2016, when concerns were raised over the governance and financial management of this particular charity, it was identified that the former chief executive and his wife were connected to 12 companies.  However, in official documentation submitted to the Companies Registration Office different dates of birth and signatures were provided at the time, along with use of a maiden name for some entries and a married name for others.  I expect members will agree that this is not something we want to see recur.  The online register, combined with PPSN verification, will ensure that such scenarios are prevented.  To ensure personal information is protected the PPSNs are encrypted, not visible to RBO staff and are used only at a specific point in time, that is to say, the point of filing, to validate the PPSN and date of birth against the data that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection holds for that personal public service number.<\/p><p>Where there is not a match, whether by accident or intent, that beneficial owner information cannot be filed.  The PPSN will not be visible to staff within the RBO or the CRO because it will be stored in encrypted form.  RBO staff and officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation have worked closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect personal information and that there is a lawful reason for processing the PPSN data.<\/p><p> While the obligation to file with the RBO is new, relevant entities have been required to hold such beneficial ownership information since the introduction of the European Communities (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations in 2016.  The RBO and filing requirements are provided for in S.I. No. 110 of 2019 -  the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019.  Under this statutory instrument, the RBO has been established since 22 June last.<\/p><p>While the staff and ICT infrastructure of the CRO have been utilised in the technical development of the RBO, S.I. No. 110 of 2019 provides for a new statutory office of Registrar of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies.  Therefore, while the CRO is a specified body under Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, following legal advice and to ensure legal certainty, the current regulations designate the Registrar of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies explicitly and separately as a specified body for the purposes of PPSN.  As such, the opening of the RBO has been postponed to allow for the necessary consultation to be undertaken with both Houses of the Oireachtas and, following referral, this committee.<\/p><p> This is a matter of urgency.  Already we are facing fines from the European Commission, which has referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, so it is imperative that we get this through as quickly as we can.  Almost all European states are working on this; some of them are delayed as we are.  While all previous designations have been done by way of primary legislation, given the need to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency, to allow the central register to open, the most appropriate course of action is for the RBO to be designated by means of a statutory instrument.  The 2005 Act allows for a \"specified body\" to be prescribed by statutory instrument and these regulations provide the most appropriate course of action to facilitate the opening of the central register in order to minimise the impact of wider infringement proceedings against Ireland for failure to transpose all aspects of the anti-money laundering directive, 4AMLD.  I wish to advise the committee that this statutory instrument will be temporary and that the regulations will be confirmed in primary legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p><p> The collection and maintenance of beneficial ownership information is an EU requirement and part of larger efforts by Ireland internationally to combat money laundering, organised crime and terrorism.  Beyond this, the RBO is a mark of Ireland as a global, modern and open country promoting best international standards in transparency, business and the globally interconnected financial system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019070900002#C00100","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562626800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.

The experts tell us that personal public service, PPS, numbers are necessary in order to ensure the accuracy of the central Register of Beneficial Ownership, which is an anti-money laundering device.  The Minister of State also states: \"To ensure personal information is protected, the PPSN is encrypted, not visible to RBO staff and is used only at a specific point in time (i.e. at the point of filing) to validate the PPSN and date of birth against the data that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection hold for that PPSN\".  I am glad he has given that assurance and I hope it will be honoured.<\/p><p> The Minister of State went on to say at the end of his presentation that this is a temporary device to prevent the EU from fining us and will ultimately be confirmed in primary legislation.
