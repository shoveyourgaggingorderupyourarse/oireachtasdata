I am joined by my colleagues Patrick Farrell, our retail banking director, and Kevin Hewston, interim chief operations officer.  This is my first appearance before the committee since being appointed chief executive of the bank in June of last year.<\/p> <p>  Firstly, I assure the committee that I will always listen to the committee members and give them whatever assistance I can, and that I want Permanent TSB to bring vigorous competition, better service, better products and better value to Irish customers and small businesses in communities across Ireland.  I want to build a sustainable bank for the future and at the centre of any sustainable business is the responsibility it has to its customers.<\/p> <p>  As soon as I took up my position I set out a new purpose for Permanent TSB.  This is centred on building trust with our customers and connecting with the bank&rsquo;s community heritage, which has evolved over the past 200 years from our unique roots in communities throughout Ireland as the former Irish Permanent Building Society and the former First Trustee Savings Banks.  I set out this purpose because I want Permanent TSB to be known for having a strong sense of social purpose and one that plays a broader role in Irish society.  I strongly believe that maximising the return for customers leads to maximising the return for shareholders over the long term.  At the heart of growing a truly sustainable business is the fair treatment of and good returns for customers, acknowledging the requirement for any bank to make a return on capital so as to be financially sustainable.<\/p> <p>  While we still have more work to do to further build trust with customers, and I acknowledge there are legacy issues from the past, we are taking steps in the right direction and over the last year we have put our purpose into action with a number of measures.  We have kept all 76 of our branches open throughout the pandemic and committed to maintaining our existing branch network.  In addition to the &euro;30 million investment over the last five years, we have committed to investing a further &euro;5 million over the coming year in refurbishing and maintaining branches to make sure they remain an attractive place for our customers to do business.  We made significant cuts to our mortgage interest rates, both for new and existing customers, with greater fairness in our mortgage pricing and a shift towards offering the same rates to both new and existing customers.  We have supported our customers who were affected by the pandemic with more than 13,000 payment breaks to give these customers valuable breathing space at a time of significant upheaval.  We continue to work closely with some 1,000 customers who require ongoing support.  We supported the provision of affordable and social housing with a partnership between the bank and the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, in which the bank provides financial and operational support to the &Oacute; Cualann group.  We achieved the Business Working Responsibly Mark, which is the leading standard for corporate social responsibility and sustainability certification in Ireland.  We have also announced plans to hire more than 180 new staff with a particular focus on IT skills, to complement a &euro;150 million investment in our IT systems and digital banking capabilities.  We have announced a major initiative to grow our presence in the SME lending market, which included teaming up with the State&rsquo;s Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, to provide more than &euro;50 million in new low-cost lending to small businesses.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the single biggest example of our commitment to making things better for customers, our communities and the wider economy is our announcement in February that we are in discussions with the NatWest Group to acquire certain elements of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s retail and SME banking business.  This shows our ambition to become Ireland&rsquo;s best personal and small business bank, a bank with deep roots in Irish communities that can bring even greater competition to customers at a time when customers need competition more than ever.  If we are successful in agreeing commercial terms, Permanent TSB will be a bank with more customers, a larger footprint, greater reach and a greater ability to bring new and better products and services to retail and SME customers.<\/p> <p>  Before I conclude my opening remarks I must offer the committee an apology with regard to the level of detail I can go into at this stage about our discussions with the NatWest Group.  I hope members will appreciate that both sides have agreed to conduct these negotiations in the strictest of confidentiality and I must also respect our disclosure obligations as a company that is quoted on the Dublin and London stock exchanges.  I can say that I have been greatly encouraged at how constructively both sides are approaching these discussions.  It is my aim that we will reach an agreement that will benefit customers and create value for the State through its shareholding in the bank.<\/p> <p>  I reaffirm our commitment to continuing to support customers as we exit the Covid-19 pandemic and in demonstrating our purpose of building trust with customers.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I will now open up the floor for questions to the representatives of Permanent TSB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#A00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I welcome our witnesses and the chief executive's opening statement.

It is our ambition to expand also into small business banking to provide competition, an area that we know is dominated by the two larger banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.

We see that customers appreciate that but they also understand the types of services we offer in branches are changing.  Naturally, more transactions are going online but there is an added benefit for customers to come into a branch or indeed for our branch staff to go and visit customers in their home in the locality in order to assist them with mortgage applications, business applications or business banking.

In other cases we have reached agreements with customers around long-term arrangements for payment and that is a continuing discussion.

I acknowledge his commitment to retaining the existing branch network and indeed I think he committed to expanding it.  However, I want to ask about the form that will take.  I am conscious that in a number of its branches PTSB is withdrawing the cash desk service and moving to automated machines.  I believe the number of such branches is 44 and Mr. Crowley might confirm that.  We saw those actions taking place in April and then again this month.  On the future plans for the network, how many more branches is PTSB intending to move to automated machines only?  I ask because there is a sense, which I share, that it is a lesser service or a lesser presence in the community when compared with a branch that has a number of staff, as opposed to perhaps one or two, actually operating in the branch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#B01200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her question.

Part of our commitment to ensuring each branch is sustainable and will continue to exist is how we think about the services in those branches and how we think about changing them.  In order to give the Senator more detail about our approach and where our thoughts are on that I will hand over to Mr. Farrell, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#B01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  As Mr. Crowley has said, the branches are a core part of our business.  They have been a core part of our community bank for over 200 years and we see them as a core part of our business going forward.  During that period the network evolved and it is evolving today.  The Senator is correct that 44 of our branches are moving to automated cash services but I will explain what that allows us to do.  Our focus in those branches is to ensure we can stop doing the administrative tasks behind the counter and get our staff out front of house so when one comes into our branches one is met by a person.  We acknowledge consumer behaviour has changed drastically, particularly in the last 15 months, towards more mobile and online banking.  Our customers also really want to meet a person and the core of our bank at a community level has always been about people.  We are still able to do 98% of the in-branch transactions that a person could have done when there was a cash desk but by using state-of-the-art automated machines we are able to get our staff out front of house to engage with our customers to help and assist them.<\/p><p>We also have a 100-strong external workforce in the community.  Not all customers can come in to us.  We have to bring our branch service into every home and business in the country.  Covid has restricted that a little bit in the past while.  We want to get that workforce back out again so they can engage with and look after our customers.  <\/p><p> We have invested &euro;30 million in the past number of years.  As Mr. Crowley said, we are investing &euro;5 million this year.  We are also considering other brand formats.  We use pop-up stores, particularly in shopping centres.  We want to bring our services to the customer to make sure that we stay relevant and viable.  We see our branches as a core part of our franchise and business, and people are at the heart of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#B01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Farrell.

Am I to understand that the bank is moving to a model of staff physically going out into the community to people's homes or will it be a telephone-based service?  I would like to a clear picture of what exactly he is describing when he refers to going out into the community.<\/p> <p>  I share his view that people want to meet a person.  He described it as an administrative task.  People using cash desks meet members of staff.  Whether people are standing in the foyer or behind a desk, customers are meeting a person.  Our concern is that they will meet fewer people and will instead be pointed in the direction of a machine.  To me, that equates to a lesser or reduced service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#C00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  The 2% refers to coin.  In our branch model where we have automated cash services people cannot lodge or withdraw coin.  That is the key difference in transactions.  We have about three branches in each territory, and a community branch can accept coins.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's second question, it is not about telephones.  We are building up our direct bank with a phone and mobile banking service.  I am talking about people on the ground.  Prior to Covid, we had moved to getting our people out into the community.  As I mentioned, we have a 100-strong workforce that can deal with customers, which involves current and deposit accounts, mortgages, consumer finance, etc.  Covid has put paid to people visiting homes and businesses before now, but now that we are coming out of the pandemic it is about mobilising that workforce again to get back into the community.  It is very much person-to-person, supported by our very strong investment in digital capability. <\/p> <p>  We can see a massive shift in customer behaviour and an appetite for digital banking capability.

My last question relates to mortgage competition.  We have a particular issue in this country with regard to competition in the mortgage market.  PTSB launched a new product in February or March that allows customers to fix their mortgage for a term of four years at 2.25%.  However, this is only available to new customers rather than the existing customer base.  Some might call that a form of dual pricing.

We completed the investigation with the Central Bank in May 2019 and paid the fine at that stage.  We admitted to misdemeanours with respect to publication.  That was more than two years ago. <\/p> <p>  We continue to engage with the FSPO with regard to tracker cases where customers have, in some cases, raised those cases directly with it.  They do not necessarily have to come to the bank to raise those issues, and can instead go directly to the ombudsman.  In the region of 200 cases are with the ombudsman at this moment in time.  We also have some cases of tracker customers, which are in a legal process through the court system.<\/p><p>There are approximately 80 cases at present.  With regard to the number of impacted accounts, there are more than 2,000 and we have redressed and compensated these customers.<\/p><p> With respect to the comment on the 18 findings from the FSPO, naturally this is something on which we engaged with the ombudsman directly.  Some of the findings were partial findings and others were full findings against the bank, depending on the nature of the engagement.  It is fair to say the bank was probably one of the first, if not the first, bank in the tracker mortgage examination.  Hence, the engagement with the ombudsman is more mature and we had more cases earlier than other banks.  This is what may give rise to these numbers.  We absolutely accept that engagement not only with the ombudsman but also with customers is very important to resolve this issue.<\/p><p> With regard to the number of properties that were at issue, I do not have the exact number in front of me but it was in the region of 40.  I apologise, it is one of the items I just do not have to hand but it is something I will come back to.  With regard to provisioning, naturally I mentioned the fact there are still in the region of 80 cases involved in the legal process.

Will Mr. Crowley clarify whether the ruling affected Permanent TSB customers?  Of the 200 cases before the FSPO, how many types of groups are there?  Are there specific groupings?  For example, 40 could be to do with a prevailing rate issue.  Does Mr. Crowley have any detail on this?<\/p> <p>  More generally, this is the first time the bank has come before the committee since the fine was handed down on 30 May.  The bank was fined &euro;21 million for serious failings across 2,007 tracker mortgage customers' accounts.  This happened until October 2018, including during the tracker mortgage examination, which is shocking and damning.  It calls into question the statements that representatives of the bank previously made to the public through this committee.  In the words of the Central Bank, the fine reflected an unacceptable harm that Permanent TSB caused to its tracker mortgage customers for an extended period of significant overcharging, to the loss of 12 family homes and 19 buy-to-let properties.  We know the fine was reduced from &euro;30 million to &euro;21 million under the settlement discounted scheme.  What are Mr. Crowley's views on the fine and the reasons for it?

I do not have specific groupings at present but I will happily engage subsequently with the committee on this aspect.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point the Deputy made on the finding and the fine, clearly the bank has apologised for what has happened.  Indeed, it has apologised over an extended period of time.  Unfortunately, it is a very difficult and bad history that not only Permanent TSB has had but the wider banking sector has had through the tracker engagement, through the financial crisis and as we approached the mid-2010s, with regard to how banks interacted.  As an organisation this is something we have taken on board.  We have paid our fine, which was significant, and we accepted the misdemeanours put forward in the settlement agreement.  We have learned from it and we are trying to move forward.  As we engage with the FSPO, we are trying to resolve cases on an ongoing basis with customers in this area.

Knowing the impact the bank had on those families and the financial situation, not only those who lost their homes but those who were burdened by the threat of repossession and the overcharging the bank was involved in, which I have described as theft in the past and will continue to do so, I am sure that when they hear commentary such as \"misdemeanours\" it will be a red rag.  The problem here is that Mr. Crowley's predecessor apologised through the committee but now we have learned from the Central Bank that at the time of those apologies, when Mr. Crowley's predecessor was saying the bank had learned a lesson and was apologising for what was happening, the bank was continuing to inflict harm on some of its customers through this process, right up until 2018.  This is very hard to stomach.  We need to see real action in terms of a customer focused proposal or view from the bank.<\/p> <p>  To look forward, I am on the record as looking to see Permanent TSB emerge as a third force in the market.  It has stated its interests in acquiring a portion of Ulster Bank's loan book.  It has been reported this could include up to &euro;9 billion, or 60% of the loan book from non-tracker mortgages, small businesses and consumer loans.  Given that the State owns 75% of the bank on behalf of the taxpayer, the State and taxpayer have an interest in any inquisition, as Mr. Crowley will understand.  Will he clarify the portion of the loan book in which Permanent TSB is interested?  We understand a memorandum of understanding has yet to be agreed between Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank.  Will Mr. Crowley update the committee on the status of the negotiations, insofar as it is possible for him to do?  What cost range would he give for the acquisition of the portion of the loan book I have mentioned?  Previously it was estimated at just over &euro;500 million.  What would be the total capital reserves at Permanent TSB's disposal to fund such an acquisition?

We have some headroom in that number and we are at a safe place today.

Also, banking business models in Europe are somewhat under threat because of negative interest rates and excess liquidity.  That is the case in Ireland more so than other European countries.  Credit formation has been low in recent years arising from the crisis and the difficulties that gave.  Also, saving rates have increased significantly.  Savings among Irish households are up &euro;30 billion in the last three years, with over &euro;15 billion of that in the last year alone.  There is an excess of liquidity over lending.  That excess liquidity attracts a negative rate and is having an impact on the profitability of banks and the return we make as organisations.<\/p> <p>  To come back to the core point, if I take Irish share prices in their own right, they were much impacted by Covid and the uncertainty of Brexit.  We saw that once there was some positive news on Brexit, together with a lifting of Covid restrictions or at least a visibility of that, Irish share prices have recently increased.  Our share price has gone up significantly but I would also suggest that it is based on speculation around our previous discussion relating to the Ulster Bank franchise.  In more recent weeks, the share prices have come down slightly but they are at a higher level versus where they were in recent years.  I would suggest that there is an anticipated increase in commercial activity among wider society post pandemic.  I appreciate that there is an element of society that may not benefit from that but generally there is an anticipation of extra spending.

Therefore, it is quite a competitive market and there is a lot of information for customers.  We must compete like everybody else in that respect.  Naturally, there has been some comment, particularly arising from the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, report in February, regarding the level of capital required by banks to support mortgage lending.  It highlights the competitive nature of how interest rates and costs are driven in respect of banks making a return.  I believe there will be more debate on this aspect in due course.  However, the retail area of banking is very competitive, no company has it its own way and market shares in recent years show that it is not a one-way bet.  It is necessary to work hard for every mortgage and work with all customers in a proactive way to get them from application to draw down and, ultimately, to get them keys to their own homes.

Turning to the utilisation of the &euro;155 million, that provision in itself is for a long-term situation, including the impact of Covid-19.  I mentioned in my opening comments that we provided 13,000 payment breaks.  Approximately 1,000 customers from that total of 13,000 continue to require forbearance.  Our view of, and thought process underpinning, that provisioning was that the numbers could have been higher than the 1,000 customers who have availed of this mechanism.  I suggest, therefore, that we are adequately provisioned regarding any potential losses in future.  However, such losses may not occur for several years as we continue to work with customers in respect of the resolution of the Covid-19 pandemic.

My final question refers to the issue Deputy Farrell raised about mica.  Can Mr. Crowley elaborate on his comments?  Being helpful to customers can mean ten different things.  It can mean low interest rates.  It can mean forbearance in terms of mortgages.  The core issue here is what was expected by my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, and I when we wrote to the banks, and by the MICA Action Group at the time.  We were looking for PTSB and other banks to support the redress scheme by contributing to it, but they refused to do so.  Does Mr. Crowley foresee a scenario whereby there would be a contribution from the bank as a result of the mica redress scheme?<\/p> <p>  Can Mr. Crowley explain how a loan for a mica affected property is classified on the books of PTSB?  Let us be clear on this.  We have seen that one third of homes that applied for the scheme in Donegal need to be demolished, therefore, their asset value is zero.  Some of those assets are secured by PTSB loans.  How are those loans classified on the books of PTSB?<\/p><p>Has the fact that the assets are now valueless triggered an impairment review?  How is PTSB dealing with those assets and what are its obligations with regard to reporting?  There are clear obligations for impairment of loans.  One of those obligations relates to cases where the value of the assets that are secured on the loan drops, and in these cases the value has, unfortunately, dropped significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#H02100","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

We understand that scheme may change but, as I understand it from the BPFI, we are not aware of the details.  There is absolute acceptance that PTSB must play its part by supporting customers who, for reasons beyond their own control and creation, have been affected by this issue.

It severely disabled a number of systems and necessitated the complete shutdown of the HSE's network.  We have been working to recover systems ever since.  The HSE response contains four stages.  First, the containment phase, which is now completed.  Second, the inform phase, which is also complete, but the task is ongoing.  Daily and weekly briefings are being provided to multiple stakeholders.  Third, the assess phase, which involves the restoration of services and eradication of ransomware from the network.  That phase is continuing.  Finally, the remedy phase, which involves strengthening our network against future cyber threats.  That phase is continuing.<\/p> <p>  The restoration process and the accompanying due diligence exercise is necessarily taking some time.  Although we can effectively decrypt data, that is only one element of it.  The malware must also be eradicated.  Decryption takes much longer than the original encryption, and eradication involves additional tasks to ensure that the perpetrators have no access route back into our systems.  We have worked with specialist cybersecurity firms and our application vendors to develop solutions to improve the efficiency of the decryption and eradication process, and it is showing dividends.  So far, 75% of our server estate has been decrypted and 70% of our end-user devices are now available.<\/p> <p>  While the architecture of our network dictates a certain initial sequence to the restoration of services, the majority of our sequencing decisions are clinically informed.  We are focusing our efforts on restoring the systems most critical to patient care in the first instance.  From a technical standpoint, many systems are now operational again, but restoring interoperability between systems and sites is ongoing.  That continues to impact on service delivery.  Characteristically, our staff across the country have worked extremely hard to keep services going in the face of the enormous challenges presented by the cyberattack and ensuing shutdown.  They are doing this at a time when our health system is experiencing very high demand for services.  I want to particularly thank staff for their hard work and commitment to the delivery of services to the public at this time.  Our IT staff, supported by the Defence Forces and contracted IT experts, have maintained a relentless schedule.  This continues seven days a week.<\/p> <p>  There is no underestimating the damage that this cyberattack has caused.  There are financial costs, certainly, but there will, unfortunately, also be human costs.  I assure members and the public that we are doing everything possible to restore the systems.  I must also caution that it will likely take months before systems are fully restored.  Accordingly, I must ask the public for continued forbearance and understanding.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to say that the Covid-19 vaccination programme is making really good progress.  We administered 340,000 vaccinations last week and GPs have administered close to 1.5 million vaccines.  Our other vaccination channels, namely, community-based vaccination teams, acute hospitals, ambulance and community pharmacies, are also functioning very effectively indeed.<\/p> <p>  We have 39 vaccination centres in place.  Over 3.7 million vaccines have been administered.  Over 2.3 million people have now received a first dose, or single dose, of the vaccine and over 1.3 million have received a second dose, or single dose.<\/p><p>Our key objective in prioritising vaccine cohorts is to protect the most vulnerable.  It is apparent, given the major drop in hospitalisations and mortality, that we are achieving this.<\/p><p> It is probably accepted by everyone that the health and well-being of mothers and babies has been at the heart of maternity visit restrictions, which I accept are a significant burden.  Hospitals must apply infection prevention and control measures in a manner appropriate to the physical infrastructure that they have.  We have provided guidance on partner access as I will outline.  Maternity services should facilitate a minimum of a 30 minute visit daily.  The partner should be facilitated during labour while the woman is in the labour ward.  It may not be possible to facilitate women in multi-occupancy antenatal wards before they go to the labour ward.  Partners should be facilitated at the anomaly scan and any other visit that may involve communications of emotional significance.  Parents should be facilitated in the national neonatal intensive care unit, NICU.  Given the improved Covid-19 situation, we recently asked all maternity hospitals and units to review their approach again.  This week, the national women and infants health programme is meeting with the clinical leads of the six maternity networks.  Subject to infrastructure limitations, I am confident that the least restrictive approach possible will be adopted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Good morning.

Regarding the cyberattack and cost, there are a few aspects for now and the future, as the Senator said.  We will incur a number of costs in the short and medium term.  As the Senator described, much technical work will have to be carried out on the network and infrastructure.  There are capital costs to replace a number of devices across our networks which we believe it would not be best practice to leave on the network with the new controls that we will put in place.  There are also capital costs where we will need to and will take the opportunity to upgrade some of our key systems, such as national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS, our radiology system, to bring them up to a higher standard.  Third party costs, as the Senator mentioned, relate to technical expertise that we have engaged including some of the best technical experts from a range of specialist providers that we have engaged in the country.  As the Senator rightly said, we have also engaged international expertise, primarily the international organisation in the USA, Mandiant, which is working on the decryption process.  It is a world leader in malware and ransomware recovery.  It has been working with us since the cyberattack.  There are costs across a range of providers.<\/p> <p>  We will have to incur costs in the future, considering the scale and size of our networks.  I worked on networks previously in different organisations.  Many organisations have a 24-hour monitoring centre, sometimes called a service operation centre or network operation centre.  Due to the scale of the network, we will need to put in place a security operation centre to monitor our network much more comprehensively for 24 hours.

There will be two more weeks of more than 300,000.  In July, based on the national immunisation advisory committee's, NIAC, recommendations on what vaccines we can utilise with which age cohorts, we are down to just Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines, unless and until there is a change regarding the use of Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines.

We heard from the INMO at the end of last weekend that overcrowding has become a feature again in our hospitals, particularly Letterkenny, Limerick and Cork hospitals, and some in some other hospitals as well.  A number of years ago the emergency department task force was established.  The INMO is represented on that task force.  I understand Mr. Reid also sits on that task force.  My understanding is that it has not met since January 2020.  Given the serious overcrowding being experienced in our emergency departments again, why has it been so long since the task force met?

While attendances have gone up, the admission rate has not changed hugely in many sites.  Prior to the cyberattack, the patient flow was much improved.  We had seen an increase, but because of the some of the capacity the Deputy referenced earlier in terms of our hospital avoidance measures and egress options, we have seen the lowest ever rate of delayed discharges.  There are number of things that were working very well that have been impacted by the cyberattack.  We are seeing longer lengths of stay in hospitals and greater numbers of attendances.

It would be wise if the emergency department task force met as soon as is possible notwithstanding all of the other challenges.  If there is a particular problem in some hospitals, whatever the reason, it would be useful if the task force were to meet.<\/p> <p>  I have two more questions for Mr. Reid.  The first is in regard to student nurses and midwives in placements.  There was a commitment to pay them &euro;100 and that was to be backdated.  My understanding, having engaged with the INMO, is that not all students have been paid.  I do not know if that is down to the cyberattack or if there is some other reason for it.  Whatever the reason, voluntary hospitals appear to be more on top of making the payments than is the case with acute hospitals run by the HSE.<\/p><p>I ask Mr. Reid to respond to that.<\/p><p> Mr. Reid gave figures earlier for the vaccine roll-out.  We all welcome that more people are getting vaccinated, which is really good news.  The harm associated with Covid is significantly reducing because of the vaccine roll-out, which is something we should all celebrate.  Mr. Reid spoke about the supply of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines over the coming months.  I ask him to give us the figures for the Janssen vaccine.  The last time Mr. Reid appeared before the committee, the Minister had said that the worst-case scenario for June was about 60,000 doses of the Janssen vaccine, with the best-case scenario being 230,000.  My understanding is we might have got about 70,000.  We were expecting very significant amounts of the Janssen vaccine in July.  Again, my understanding is that will be at the lower end of the expectation.  We know the Janssen vaccine is also being made available to pharmacists.  I ask Mr. Reid to give us the breakdown on the Janssen vaccine and to outline the status of payments to student nurses and midwives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#D01700","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>On the first item, I will take that away.

As Mr. Reid said, the original forecast in June was for approximately 470,000.  Because of manufacturing problems in the US, that was revised down to a best case of 235,000 and a worst case of 60,000.  I would anticipate it being closer to the worst-case scenario based on the recent feedback from Janssen.  We will see how the usage of it works out in pharmacies.

How many hospitals are not complying with this?  The Minister is getting all the flak for this.  Much of the content of the emails is directed personally at him.

I will make a brief comment on his opening comments about vaccines.  We certainly are in a much stronger position than we could have expected in terms of the benefits we are seeing from the vaccination programme, both in reduced hospitalisations and visits to ICU.  As of last night, we had 39 hospitalisations, of whom 13 were in ICU.  Contrast that with the dark days of January when there were 2,020 in hospital and 212 people in ICU.  We are seeing the benefits, including in the public mood.<\/p> <p>  Our experience and that of the public is that every time we think we are ahead of the virus, whether that was last summer or Christmas, it has a tendency to bite back.  The immediate concern is the Delta variant.  We are seeing in the percentage rise in cases, not just in Ireland but in European countries and cities, a very prevalent surge in the Delta variant.  There is no reason to expect that Ireland will be any different or that we will not see a surge in Delta variant cases.  That is a trend we are beginning to see and it is a concern.  Notwithstanding that, we are in a much stronger position than we might have expected.<\/p> <p>  On vaccines for the 60 to 69 years cohort, we take all of our administration of vaccines guidance from the national immunisation advisory committee.  It gives guidance to the CMO who makes recommendations to the Government and we comply with all of that.  In fairness to NIAC, it takes the best world evidence and monitors that carefully daily and weekly.  It continues to do that.  The guidance and advice at that stage was that AstraZenica was suitable to be administered to people above the ages of 50.  The risks that were prevalent at that stage were to population ages below that.  That was the process then.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the timeframe, it had been, if the Deputy recalls, the administration of a second dose was moved from 12 weeks to 16 weeks.  That interval has now moved back to eight weeks.  We have a programme in place whereby last week alone, almost 100,000 people were given their second dose of AstraZenica.  This applies to about 450,000 people in total.  The process will be accelerated and instead of a nine-week programme, it will be a five-week programme.  Everybody in all the age groups that received AstraZenica should have received the second dose by the week commencing 19 July.  That accelerates the process and we will increasingly see people in the 60 to 69 years cohort.  We are vaccinating by age so the vast majority of the people who received the second dose last week should have been in that age cohort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>On the opening of the economy on 5 July, we could soon have large numbers of unvaccinated young people who work in hospitality working in an indoor environment.

That is the process.  From the HSE's perspective, we are obviously keenly focused on the impacts on hospitalisation and ICU admissions and the impacts on our hospital service in general.  After every wave of this virus, we have suffered significant impacts not only on Covid care, but on the care services we provide more widely.  Our concerns relate to sickness, illness, hospitalisations and their impact.  There is certainly evidence emerging from Public Health England demonstrating the impact of the variant, particularly on those people who have not been vaccinated or who have not been fully vaccinated.  The HSE has two key messages.  The first is that we want to monitor things closely because we cannot let what happened in January happen again, where hospitalisations reached over 2,000 and when more than 200 people were in our ICUs.  This had an impact on an already exhausted healthcare staff.  That is what we in the HSE will be watching.

I have questions on three areas, namely, third level students, children with cancer, and maternity restrictions, which I am sure the witnesses will receive further questions on after I conclude.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the vaccination of third level students in August and September.  I have been contacted by a number of students who are going abroad either on the Erasmus programme or for international studies.  Some of the institutions they are going to have said that the students cannot attend unless they can prove they have been vaccinated, otherwise they will not be able to attend on-campus.  Are there plans for those students?  It is not an enormous cohort but there will be a number of students who, having paid and are ready, will not be able to go abroad or will have to delay going because they will not be vaccinated in time.  Has any thought been given to that situation?<\/p> <p>  I have a second question for Mr. McCallion in relation to children with cancer.  Children with cancer and their parents are still waiting to hear when vaccines will be made available to children aged 12 to 15.  I know the Pfizer vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, but there has been no word yet from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, on this.  We are waiting on NIAC to give the go ahead.  Has the HSE given any consideration on how it will prioritise these high-risk patients in that age group, because they have been isolating for a long time and, obviously, the parents are extremely concerned about their children.  I will throw all my questions out and the witnesses can do as they will with them.<\/p> <p>  On the maternity restrictions, why are the risk assessments not publicly accessible despite the calls from Dr. Peter McKenna in April, and the HSE in May, to make them public?  Is there any further information as to why these risk assessments are not available?  On 10 May, Dr. Tony Holohan said that there should be a return to pre-pandemic partner access.  There still seems to be mixed messages on when that will happen.  Do the witnesses know when that is going to happen, whether it will be in the coming months or weeks?<\/p> <p>  The vaccination levels among maternity unit staff, and pregnant people and partners will affect restrictions.  Obviously, vaccination levels are extremely high among maternity staff and levels are climbing among pregnant people and their partners.  What is the current position of the HSE on the risk associated with partner attendance in maternity units, where other public health guidelines, such as social distancing and the wearing of personal protective equipment, are taken into account?  There was reference made in the guidelines that partners could not be allowed in for privacy reasons, I am sure the witnesses are aware of this.  That was never a reason in pre-pandemic times.  Therefore, why has privacy suddenly started to be referred to as a reason that pregnant peoples' partners need to be kept away from certain things, when that was not the case before the pandemic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#H00700","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I will make a few comments and they pass to my colleagues, Mr. McCallion and Dr. Henry.

We started to programme based on NIAC advice, which was starting with residents and staff in long-term care facilities, moving on to healthcare workers, then people over the higher age groups and, indeed, medically vulnerable groups.  We should remain confident that this was the correct approach, that is what is working for Ireland and working for our vaccination programme.  There have been many calls throughout the programme to date, at the very early stages, the middle stages and now, to look to different groups at different stages.  We take our absolute advice, guidance and direction from NIAC and through the Chief Medical Officer and Government policy.  I reiterate that is has worked, it is working, and we should continue with it based on the process of working through the age groups.  It is based on limited supply and if we had a full supply, we would love to vaccinate all age cohorts together, but we must stick with what is working, and that is my very strong message to the committee.

That would be part of the solution in terms of how we do it.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, it could come down to the speed at which we can roll this out.  We have found if we can do it very quickly, it is often as quick to do that and to try to bring those people through, depending on the numbers, in specific ways.

The high levels of community transmission and the outbreak obviously led to severe restrictions.  Cases falling, hospitals becoming safer and the vaccination programme taking hold have allowed us to ease visiting restrictions.  It is under constant review.  I mentioned to Deputy Crowe's colleagues earlier that the most recent review this week is expanding beyond those four areas which are listed in the opening statement to additional areas.<\/p> <p>  We issued guidance.  We contacted all the hospitals.  There is, as has been mentioned, some variation based on infrastructure, which is understandable.  Some of these maternity units are quite old, with infrastructure which corresponds to another age when it comes to ideal infection prevention control measures.  Our principal aim is to keep women, babies and pregnancies safe.  That is of great importance to us given the risk we are now aware of, not just from Ireland but from abroad, to both women and pregnancies from Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The most recent advice, which we will be altering this week, goes into those additional areas.  I will not repeat them again because I have stated them to the Deputy's colleagues.  We then follow up through our operations, working with Ms O'Connor and her colleagues through all those 19 maternity units and marking them against compliance with the latest iteration of our visiting guidance.

In most cases, but not all, the person is good health, and that needs to be stressed.<\/p> <p>  There are situations in which a maternity hospital is co-located with a medical hospital and there are complexities with that.

It is morally cruel they are denied.  I hope the guidelines being issued will be taken up by all hospitals, because there is no political barrier to this.

Can that issue be clarified?  Can the 16 units which are following the overall guidelines issue a statement to that effect individually?<\/p><p> The cyberattack has resulted in a huge build-up of waiting lists for surgery and for many procedures.  Is it possible to expand the treatment purchase fund to deal with the backlog?  For instance, yesterday I heard of someone being advised to go to Northern Ireland for a hip operation although the same facilities are available in a private hospital in Cork within 30 miles of where they live.

That is the key driver for us and for all our clinical and medical teams across the country.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Henry will answer on specifics but we get returns from the 19 individual maternity hospitals on the implementation of the guidance document that Dr. Henry sent out nationally.  In fairness, I mentioned earlier that 16 of the 19 were fully compliant last Thursday.  The three that were not put in measures to be fully compliant for this week.  When I say a hospital is not compliant, it is not that those concerned are mischievously going out to be non-compliant.  They have certain conditions in their hospital where they find it difficult to find the risk balance between access and visits and infection prevention and control.  That is the rationale and the reason this happens.  <\/p> <p>  As for the waiting lists for surgery, with every wave we have, our waiting lists for people for various forms of surgery and elective care are affected.  The national service plan for this year has two funds, namely, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, of &euro;125 million and the access to care fund, which is about &euro;210 million.  We are working collaboratively with our colleagues in the Department of Health and with the Minister about an approach for the best use of those funds to address some of the waiting lists.  To be frank, it has been significantly impactful for us, particularly with the recent cyberattack.  It will involve a combination of using private capacity, using the NTPF, strengthening further capacity through the recruitment of consultants and other teams in our public hospitals and new ways of working that my colleague Ms Anne O'Connor has implemented during Covid, which involve many outpatient departments getting waiting lists in a very different way.

As others have said, we have been inundated with testimonies, which were sometimes heartbreaking, from expectant mothers, mothers who gave birth last year and some who have suffered heartbreaking situations where news around scans and anomalies was delivered in a very cold fashion because of Covid.  I will briefly read some testimony.  A lady called Stacey contacted me to say that partners are not visitors, fathers are not visitors and that she needs her husband to be there during labour and the post-natal period.  She asked that these restrictions be lifted, as this uncertainty is crippling.

It was heartbreaking.  Another lady wrote how women and their partners are looking for a return to pre-pandemic levels of access through the pregnancy journey.  She queried the distinction between full labour and active labour and stated that women in labour need support and advocacy whether they are 1 cm, 4 cm or 10 cm dilated.  This is the whole point.  I have spoken to officials in Galway on this point of how you define labour.  Once a woman goes into a maternity hospital and presents to give birth, her partner should be there with them at all stages, as well as for 12-week and 20-week scans in particular.  They do not know what news they are going to get.  Where they get difficult news, they need to have their partner present, no ifs or buts.<\/p><p> I know that at times doctors can become immune to problems because they see so many of them, and I understand that, but women and their partners need to be together for these heartbreaking situations they have to go through where they receive bad news - and even where they do not receive bad news and the woman is just delivery a baby.  Even the normal, successful delivery of a child is an emotional roller coaster for women and their partners, and the latter need to be present.  We need to see that in place in all our maternity hospitals - no exceptions, no ifs and no buts.  Whatever has to be done to ensure that this happens needs to be done.  That is not a question; those are just comments based on testimony.  There has been enough uncertainty.  We have seen the roll-out of the vaccination programme.

I absolutely agree with him.  Our staff in the 19 maternity units want to be able to go back to a situation whereby partners can be full partners in every sense of the word during the whole process of childbirth, which, as the Senator says, is a difficult and anxious time.  It is mostly a happy time but sometimes, of course, as the Senator outlined, there are difficulties and bad news.  That is precisely why we are looking at this latest visitor guidance this week.  We are amending it to look at exactly those areas where there may be difficult news and particular anxiety, that is, those early pregnancy assessment units, people with high-risk pregnancies and people presenting in emergency situations in later pregnancy.  I mentioned earlier that nobody wanted to put in these restrictions but we were faced with overwhelming Covid disease and threat in January.  It threatened to destabilise our hospital system and, in fact, it did destabilise it.  There were multiple outbreaks in various settings.  Fifteen of those 19 units are co-located with general hospitals.  Those measures were put in place, as were the general visiting restriction measures, which also caused great distress to relatives and sick people in general hospitals and in nursing homes.  The measures were put in place in order to try to protect people as much as possible from the worst effects of this virus.  It is exactly those areas the Senator outlines that we are trying to focus on now as we return to some kind of normality.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned labour.  The practice has been, and the advice is very clear, that partners should be present in labour wards.  Sometimes women go back to antenatal wards after initial assessment.  Many of our units, which are not modern by any stretch of the imagination, are multiple occupancy wards and, as such, it was not the practice pre pandemic to have partners there constantly when other women occupy the wards.  What we are trying to standardise and to bring into practice, and what we have in those 19 units, is that a partner have every right to be present in the labour ward during labour.  What we are not able to commit to, however, based on the varying infrastructure of hospitals, is that people be present in the antenatal ward where it is a multiple occupancy ward because of the rights and privacy requirements of other women on that ward.<\/p> <p>  These are heartbreaking stories.  As I said, our staff, our working nurses and doctors, want to see pre-pandemic visiting practices return but they have had a very difficult few months themselves trying to keep women safe, to protect pregnancies and to protect women during what was certainly the worst surge of Covid-19 in January and February, during which we learned Covid is not without danger and risk to pregnancies and to women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Henry.

As I said, the heartbreaking testimonies we have seen over recent months cut to the core of life and death and expectant mothers' worry.  We therefore need to get back to whatever operated pre pandemic for expectant mothers.  They need to have that love and support of a partner for delivery and for scans.  Positive scans are fine, but you just do not know when you go in there what news you will get.  Again, reading the testimonies, where there is an anomaly, news may be delivered to women on their own, with no support.  They may be told to wait in a room or have to deliver news to their families in a car park.  It is unacceptable that that would be the way in which things operate in a hospital in this day and age.  I appreciate that Covid is the reason the restrictions are there, but for something as personal and as heartbreaking as this there needs to be a better system.  Cognisance needs to be taken of the delivery of the news and having partners there with the expectant mothers to provide that love and support and comfort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#L00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I will follow on from that point about the maternity hospital visits.

It is because of that ongoing questioning and interrogation and the direct advocacy and concerns of the women and partners involved that we are pushing hospitals to do whatever they can to comply with the guidance we have given out, which, as I said, is about recovering as quickly as we can to that pre-pandemic level.  I do not mean to labour the point but, as I said, and as the Chairman echoed, we are constantly balancing the risk.  We have found that Covid-19 is a very volatile virus in its impact on the population in healthcare settings.  The vaccination programme brings great additional protection to people and certainly has allowed us much greater freedom and has opened up choice for us in respect of visiting and other hospital services.

Mr. Reid mentioned more than 150,000 over-50s in that regard.  A number of them might have religious or moral grounds for not taking the vaccine.  Within the HSE and some of its service providers, will there be a campaign in respect of those who feel that they still do not have sufficient evidence about vaccination?  I have encountered a number of cases where people were reluctant for health reasons or just concerns about getting a vaccine.  Will there be a campaign to try to get that cohort vaccinated?  We are discussing booster shots and so on, so we want to maximise as much as possible the number of people who have been vaccinated.  Some people are concerned about alcohol, foetuses and so on supposedly being used in the vaccines.  Will there be a specific campaign to try to bring them on board with the vaccine roll-out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#M00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I will make three points.  We should acknowledge that the uptake in Ireland is strong, but we should work on who has not taken up a vaccine.  We run significant campaigns across each of the cohort age groups.  They have been adapted as we have moved through each group.  As we move into the groups comprising people in their 30s and 20s, that work continues through various media platforms, advocacy groups, influencers and sporting groups that work with us on communicating about the roll-out.  We engage collectively across a range of organisations to support the continued promotion of the roll-out.  That is key.<\/p> <p>  In support of Dr. Henry, I wish to comment on the Chairman's final suggestions, which were good, on how to encourage innovation in facilitating partner visits.  That is the direction that Dr. Henry has given to the 19 maternity hospitals.  Undoubtedly, many of the maternity hospitals not too far away from where we are sitting in Dublin city are not suited to dealing with a pandemic.  Extra and rigid measures have been put in place.  I understand the distress and stress this has caused.  The chief clinical officer, the chief operations officer and myself are relentlessly focused on ensuring that we get the best visitations with the best protections for hospitals, women and children.  They deserve it and they have our fullest commitment in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Some people will be thinking about holidays and travelling abroad.

We have publicly stated this week that Government policy will ultimately determine the approach to travel for all age groups.  However, there is no doubt that people are at their fullest level of protection when they are fully vaccinated, as in, they have received two doses.  Travel policy will be advised by the Government.  Speaking from the HSE's perspective, everyone needs to make a personal risk assessment of travel, particularly in the context of the prevalence of the Delta variant.  It is a concerning factor for us, not just because we are seeing the early rise of it in Ireland, but because it is in many European countries that many Irish people visit.  That is the caution we would give.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCallion can give more details about the travel certificate.  It is a central government-led process across a number of Departments.
