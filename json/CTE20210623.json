Apart from me and the members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely.  All members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senators Garvey and Gavan.<\/p> <p>  Today, we will give consideration to facilitating the reactivation of enterprise, trade and employment following the pandemic restrictions.  The committee will be assisted by representatives of the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  Members will recall that last week the committee considered a similar issue with representatives from Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, ISME, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.<\/p> <p>  From the County and City Management Association, I am pleased to welcome Ms AnnMarie Farrelly, chief executive of Fingal County Council and chair of the CCMA business, enterprise, innovation and urban-town economic renewal committee.  I also welcome Dr. Pat Daly, who I know well, chief executive of Limerick City and County Council; Ms Anna Marie Delaney, chief executive of Offaly County Council; Mr. Richard Shakespeare, assistant chief executive of Dublin City Council; and Mr. Padraic McElwee, chair of the local enterprise office, LEO, network and head of LEO from Clare County Council.<\/p> <p>  Before we proceed, I must outline some issues around parliamentary privilege.  I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Evidence given by witnesses physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If a witness's statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  To commence our consideration of the matter before us, I invite Ms Farrelly to make her opening remarks on behalf of the County and City Management Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":6,"content":"<p>On behalf of the CCMA, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to present on the role of local government in the reactivation of enterprise, trade and employment following the pandemic restrictions.  I am the chief executive of Fingal County Council and chair of the CCMA business, enterprise, innovation and urban-town economic renewal committee.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Dr. Pat Daly, Ms Anna Marie Delaney, Mr. Richard Shakespeare and Mr. Padraic McElwee.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities provided a range of social and economic supports throughout the pandemic appropriate to the level of restriction in place for the economic sectors and across our communities.  The roll-out of supports was implemented with pace, agility and efficiency with the aim of maintaining as much business confidence as possible during this time of unprecedented economic and societal change.<\/p> <p>  The following supports are managed directly by local authorities: 107 urban regeneration and development projects approved to a value of &euro;1.6 billion; 164 rural regeneration development projects approved to a value of &euro;338 million; &euro;633 million paid to 108,000 businesses through the restart and restart plus grants in 2020; &euro;1.2 billion of rates waivers processed, with the waiver continuing for quarter 3; &euro;85 million in direct funding to local businesses, including &euro;38 million for online trading to 16,000 businesses; &euro;60 million in funding provided for the small business assistance scheme; more than 22,000 businesses supported with one-to-one mentoring through the local enterprise offices: and the participation of almost 110,000 people in upskilling training events organised by the local enterprise offices.  There are now 35,000 jobs in 7,500 LEO-supported client companies.  In excess of 20,000 outdoor dining spaces have been facilitated for the hospitality sector on the public realm.  This includes local authority provision of more than 1,000 parklets and caf&eacute;-style options for business.  More than 1,000 hospitality businesses have also benefited from in excess of &euro;4 million in outdoor dining grants so far.  Almost 3,000 new benches and public seats have been provided.  Greatly enhanced litter prevention and cleansing regimes are in place.<\/p> <p>  As has been demonstrated, local authorities play a key role in the democratic, social, economic and cultural development of local areas.  City and county councils across Ireland provide infrastructure, amenities and services designed to improve local areas as places to live, visit and invest.  From an economic perspective, local authorities play a critical role in putting in place initiatives to stimulate the local economy and to support business in creating employment.  Never has this role been more critical than in the past 16 months.  Local authorities work closely and in partnership with Departments and key State agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Arts Council, and on a local level with chambers of commerce and business representative bodies.  This collaborative and partnership approach has been essential to navigating the challenges faced by business due to the impact of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The community call was one such action-led programme to provide services to vulnerable individuals during the Covid-19 lockdown.  Co-ordination at local level by the local authorities was critical and the sector immediately responded to the call to mobilise community networks across the State over the space of a single weekend.  At a local level, local authorities established a local authority response forum, which co-ordinated the work of the community call.<\/p><p>This involved frequent engagement through the national oversight group which included CCMA representation in its membership. <br\/><br\/>The local enterprise offices play a key role and are an integral part of each local authority, supporting start-up businesses, entrepreneurs and in general assisting businesses to scale up, innovate and develop their market potential.  Local enterprise offices, LEOs, are recognised as a one-stop shop, providing enterprise advice, coaching, management development and expertise.  The financial supports available through the LEO network have proven to be a critical contributory factor in the success story of many of Ireland&rsquo;s high performing start-ups.  It has been widely recognised that in the face of unprecedented challenge, the LEOs managed to pivot and adapt quickly to assist businesses to endure the crisis of the pandemic. <br\/><br\/>In addition, local authorities play a pivotal role in supporting tourism and the development of destinations and attractions throughout the country.  Working in collaboration and partnership with the national tourism authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, tourism task forces have been established across the sector.  The tourism industry has been one of the most affected industries by the pandemic.  The impact on a national, regional and local level has decimated the industry.  However, throughout this time, local authorities have been active and responsive in ensuring tourism on a local, regional and national level will survive and build back stronger. <br\/><br\/>Local authorities have also been instrumental in the provision of enterprise hubs.  A national digital hub network<b><\/b>of 400<b><\/b>digital hubs is now established, providing 15,000 workspaces and 270 broadband connection points.  Wifi4EU schemes are also being rolled out nationally.  All of these services are integral to future remote workings strategies.  The Look for Local and staycation tourism campaigns had significant success in 2020.  Further campaigns for summer 2021 are under way.  More than 4,500 local companies have participated in the Look for Local campaign which covered every business sector throughout the country. <br\/><br\/>Local authorities continue to lead, deliver and finance city and town centre rejuvenation projects, economic activations and other direct business supports in line with the following Government initiatives: the urban regeneration and development fund; the rural regeneration development fund; the town and village renewal scheme 2021; the walking and cycling infrastructure programme; the rural active travel investment programme; the Creative Ireland programme; the reimagining outdoor spaces fund; the outdoor seating and accessories fund; the outdoor dining enhancement scheme; the local live performance scheme; the local authorities urban animation capital infrastructure scheme; the creative climate action fund; the enhanced litter prevention and cleaning programmes to support outdoor summer 2021; and the community enhancement programme.<br\/><br\/>The projects include large-scale urban regeneration investments and town centre public realm improvements and revitalisation projects.  Town and city recovery task forces have been established to work in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Licensed Vintners Association, Retail Excellence, chambers of commerce, local business improvement district, BID, companies and other relevant stakeholders.  Dublin, Cork and Limerick city councils, along with most other local authorities, have been very active in this regard and further information is provided in our submission.<br\/><br\/>The restrictions on travel and the reduction in the capacity of public transport accentuated the necessity to accelerate active travel initiatives in cities, towns and local areas throughout Ireland.  Local authorities implemented and continue to implement a series of measures to support walking and cycling.  Active travel measures being delivered by local authorities primarily involve the improvement and expansion of cycling and walking infrastructure.  These measures were supplemented by a suite of supports designed to enhance the safety, security and comfort of cyclists and pedestrians, such as the pedestrianisation of streets, installation of benches and parklets to accommodate rest, segregation of cycle lanes and roadways, provision of quiet spaces and installation of temporary and permanent toilets.<br\/><br\/>In addition to facilitating mobility, these active travel measures play an important role in supporting the physical and mental well-being of people through the pandemic.  These measures also helped foster a greater appreciation of the natural and built heritage of local areas, while connecting local communities.  The CCMA acknowledges the considerable support of the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority which have committed &euro;393 million investment for multi-annual active travel plans, with more anticipated.  The roll-out of this is supported by creation of 248 active travel posts.  Local authorities will play a key role in achieving the Government&rsquo;s objective of delivering 1,000 km of cycling and walking infrastructure by 2025.<br\/><br\/>Local government economic plans for the coming months will build on our efforts over the past 16 months.  In November 2020, a framework for development of local economic sustainability initiatives was developed by the local government sector.  The framework was centred on significant measures and activities that were under way across the sector to support businesses at this critical time.  Over the coming weeks and months, a robust suite of initiatives will underpin economic growth at local level and provide confidence for communities, as we move forward into a period of rebuilding.  Local authorities are committed to supporting and facilitating an agile and appropriate response to business and community needs, working collaboratively with business communities and representative groups throughout the country.  New regional enterprise plans are now being developed to encourage development of new and existing businesses and to increase employment in every region.  Local authorities are a key partner in this process. <br\/><br\/>The CCMA and the local government sector acknowledge the extensive and far-reaching support provided by Government during the pandemic crisis and on a continuing basis.  Local authorities have and will continue to respond to the needs of their local areas, assist business recovery and help get people back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms AnnMarie Farrelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The members will have received a submission which they have read.

It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that Ms Farrelly from my area is here.  I thank her for being here and for all of the work she and her team have done throughout Covid-19.  I have written to her about this as well.  It has been outstanding.  Notwithstanding the challenges faced at every turn, the staff of Fingal County Council have been first-class in terms of the service provision, etc.  I would be grateful if Ms Farrelly would pass that on to the staff.<\/p> <p>  We cannot ignore the elephant in the room which is the recent issue raised by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, some members of local authorities and myself last night on the floor of the D&aacute;il, with regard to consumption of alcohol outdoors.  I do not believe any person in government, when he or she said we would have an outdoor summer, meant we would solely and only be consuming alcohol outdoors, but I also do not believe any person who said it could be ignorant of the fact consumption of alcohol will form part of the summer outdoors for some people.<\/p> <p>  I will be straight with Ms Farrelly.  It does not seem sufficient preparation was put in place.  I say that because last night, when I was on my feet in the D&aacute;il Chamber, the Minister of State read out a script on behalf of the Minister for Justice that was contradicted by a statement issued previously to the media.  The Minister for Justice has now indicated she will be drafting primary legislation to ensure people can stay within the confines of the rules and use the outdoor seating, whether that be for eating or consumption of alcohol.<\/p> <p>  That is regrettable.  It sends a poor message to businesses that are struggling.  Many of them in my area are counting the days until indoor dining reopens.  In the meantime, all they have is takeaway and outdoor dining and this has thrown a spanner in the works.  If you talk to local businesses, which I know Ms Farrelly does, they will tell you this is the last thing they need.  If you talk to the workers who are working in these local businesses, they will tell you that uncertainty over their employment is the last thing they need.<\/p> <p>  My questions are fairly simple.  Can Ms Farrelly say, with confidence, to those businesses that are operating outdoor seating for eating, drinking or both that they can continue?<\/p><p>Does she believe the primary legislation is necessary?  Can she detail what consultation took place because for my part, it does not seem like there was sufficient consultation?  If there had been, these issues would not have arisen.  What level of consultation was there with the Government in establishing what the legal position was locally?  That does not seem to have been done and it seems to be different from area to area.  It is really disappointing.<\/p><p> Can Ms Farrelly provide her views on the primary legislation and on the level of consultation?  If I were to have a pint next Friday in one of the many parklets provided by Fingal County Council outside one of the many lovely establishments in Skerries, where I live, would I be within the confines of the law?  Does she think the primary legislation is necessary or does she believe businesses can continue to trade?  Advising members of the Garda to use their discretion is not a good policy.  The Garda does not want to do that as it puts its members in a poor position.  Business owners and workers are concerned that it puts them in an unstable and precarious position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#B00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I might ask some of my colleagues to supplement anything I say here.  I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her compliments with regard to the county of Fingal.  Great efforts have been made across the country in every local authority to make sure we could get ready for the congregation that has happened as a result of the lack of indoor space.  Much of what has happened in our counties is because of the need for people to congregate outdoors.  We have been getting ready for the outdoor summer, including the provision of parklets, as referred to by Deputy O'Reilly, and outdoor space.<\/p> <p>  I can speak for most local authorities insofar as saying that usually, the local authority by-laws apply and prohibit drinking in public places.  However, where licences have been provided under section 254 of the Planning and Development Act, the alcohol by-laws do not apply to those areas.  Deputy O'Reilly is correct in saying that when I mentioned 20,000 outdoor spaces, a substantial majority of those areas have been provided to coffee shops and other dining areas where alcohol is not an issue and that should be taken into account.  Many restaurants and public houses are using their own private space for the outdoor summer.  Some have been supplemented by the outdoor parklets.<\/p> <p>  There was a lot of consultation in relation to the grants for outdoor dining, to help businesses purchase furniture for their private space and the public areas.  It is clear that local authorities are responsible for the public realm and policing of people is a matter for the Garda.  At a local level, in Fingal, there have been many conversations with the local garda&iacute;, and we worked together.  There is no doubt that the provision and the reopening of businesses, albeit with outdoor space, has greatly assisted the issue of people congregating.  As an example, in Deputy O'Reilly's own town, it was mentioned to me recently that there are as many as 2,000 seats available in the private outdoor spaces of local bars and restaurants.  Those 2,000 people were more than likely in the public area up until the bank holiday weekend in June.  That has, therefore, greatly helped maintain the safety of our towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  The discretion seems to be necessary.  Insofar as a precise interpretation of the legislation is concerned, none of our public space provision ameliorates against provisions in the licence for the public house or restaurant and that needs to be taken into account.  I understand the point of sale of alcohol is a consideration as well.  Ultimately, however, I am in members' hands as to whether further legal provision needs to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms AnnMarie Farrelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>That is the point I take issue with.

Let us bear in mind, shortly before said she was going to bring forward primary legislation, she was tweeting that it was not necessary.  This kind of shambolic carry-on is driving business owners and workers up the wall.  My time is limited so I want to be very clear.  Is Ms Farrelly confident that without primary legislation, people can serve alcohol, not in their own private spaces because I know that is covered by section 254, but in the public realm?  Is she confident that without having to exercise discretion, members of the Garda can leave people alone so long as there are no public order incidents and that the people in Skerries, Balbriggan, Swords, Rush, Lusk or wherever they happen to be can have a glass of wine with their pizza or a pint or whatever in the public spaces specifically?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#C00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am not in a position to advise Deputy O'Reilly on the individual licence criteria of businesses.

The impression that has gone out is that the people who control the car parks control the pedestrianisation, which is bonkers because the people who control the car parks clearly have an interest that is entirely at odds with the goal of pedestrianisation.  I would appreciate it were Mr. Shakespeare, particularly because he is here representing Dublin City Council, to respond to that.  It seems that the partial pedestrianisation has worked.

For the vast majority of people there, notwithstanding some messing, it was a very enjoyable experience.  People say that it is great and that it would be great if it were bigger.

I am in the happy position that both Ms Farrelly and Mr. Shakespeare cover my constituency.  I have a couple of questions.  I am interested in the council officials' view of town centre reinvention following the impact of the pandemic.  One certainly gets the impression the shift away from retail to online has dramatically accelerated.  I wonder what will be the permanent impact on town centres.  As a group, are the officials changing their strategy with respect to town centres, particularly regarding residential living within towns?  I saw data on the use of the local authority scheme for reviving derelict properties.  Waterford, which is just one city, was using 45%.  There appear to be opportunities on that front.  Is there a new approach in this regard?  The officials are now recasting both enterprise plans and development plans.  Will we see a new approach to town centre reinvention?  Ms Farrelly rightly quoted many schemes out there including, creative, public realm, cycling renewal and community schemes.  There is a need to inject within individual selected towns some methodology for pulling people together to frame a comprehensive plan and I am interested in that.<\/p> <p>  As for the long-term impact of the pandemic, the second item I am interested in is the development of remote working outside the major cities.  To what extent are local authorities looking at the potential of hubs to copper-fasten that development?  Alternatively, do the officials think this is likely to be a fairly temporary phenomenon that will not call for very significant change in infrastructure?<\/p> <p>  Obviously housing is on the minds of most people and while the building of social homes was allowed to continue through the pandemic, I am sure it was considerably interfered with, and private housebuilding came to a standstill.  How are local authorities approaching the issue of getting that back on track as quickly as possible, because there is such pressure in the housing area?<\/p> <p>  As we exit this pandemic, there are bound to be many businesses under considerable pressure.  Have the councils been looking at how they are going to look at outstanding rates bills - although I am aware they did not apply during the Covid period - or how they might manage the problems of essentially viable businesses with short-term problems?  In some cases, those businesses may be tenants of the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I have a question for Ms Delaney of Offaly County Council.  What perception does she have at this point of the progress on just transition?  Covid has no doubt dealt a blow to many of the projects that were hopefully coming on stream.  I would be interested to hear her view on where we stand with that and whether it can be accelerated in its impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#D00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will come in quickly on the town centre approach and how we might reinvent some of our town centres.  Certainly the town centres first initiative coming from Government is something on which we are working very closely with it.  It is about living and working in town centres.  The remote working opportunities may help reinvigorate some town centres and bring back more employment.  Local authorities are looking at that quite closely.  There is no doubt we need to work with all the stakeholders in towns.  The principle of town teams is well accepted by ourselves and is in place in many towns across the country.  I take the Deputy's point on dereliction.  A combination of penalisation and incentives will get more activity into our town centres.  We are worried about retail.  However, some towns which are remote from city areas have done quite well during Covid and some of those areas have reinvented themselves.  This has not perhaps been the case with city centres across the country.  I will allow my colleagues from Limerick and Dublin city to come in on that.  On remote working, I mentioned the 400 digital hubs already established and the need for more.  It is not necessarily a rural issue alone.  The likes of the towns in north County Dublin would benefit greatly from remote working hubs.  Those towns have thrived somewhat during Covid as more people lived and worked in their local time as they were working from home.  I would like to capture some of that benefit and ensure we can keep it into the future.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt housing was delayed by the Covid restrictions earlier this year.  We are doing everything we can to get that impetus going again and it certainly started off quite quickly when the restrictions lifted.  We are all working to an agenda of activating more sites and getting more construction on the ground.  It is going to be a challenging year but we are all working to the one agenda and driving through progress where we can.  On the current rates waiver, I can only give the Fingal County Council experience but 40% of businesses benefit from the rates waiver at the moment in Fingal, so we are working quite closely with the other 60% on where they stand this year and whether they are in a position to pay the rates liability due.

We have seven of the eight national cultural institutions within Dublin and that is an area on which we will need to focus.  The question of what does city shopping offer people might be asked.  The retailers have been preparing for this online shift and all we can do is try to facilitate it by improving the experience in the public realm and how people experience their city.  In Dublin we have the living city initiative, which is encouraging people to live over the shop.  That is based a particular area in the city.  It relies on tax relief for individuals who own such properties to get them to build over the shop, as you might say, and get them to create those living spaces.

Our experience in Limerick city centre is similar to Dublin.  The market is changing and people&rsquo;s needs and wants from the city centre are changing, particularly around retail.  We are all aware that.  The experiential approach will to feature more.  We have been looking at this as part of the development plan process in Limerick.  We have looked at the retail strategy for the metro area.   That is common across authority areas in the country as they prepare the development plans.  It is about looking at how to animate that space much more, as well as at how it can trip into the night-time economy, so that there would not be two distinct phases of an experience in Limerick from the business side in the daytime, switching not very effectively into the night economy.  We have been asked to look deeply at that.<\/p> <p>  Revitalisation will be the carrot and stick approach, as Ms Farrelly mentioned.  We are using all our legislative bases to challenge people who are moving on or developing properties.  At the same time, we are gaining some success in Limerick on taking those back into ownership, changing them,  and offering them back to the market.  The owners are also stepping up to the plate and doing things.  The Living City Initiative was mentioned.  We are having some success in Limerick, which is a Georgian city.  The scheme is dedicated to older buildings.  Georgian buildings, in particular, are costly.  The grant level may need to change or to be looked at.  Broadly, it has the potential to be successful, but it may need some tweaking.  We will probably engage with the committee on that later.  However, it has potential and it would give people an impetus to develop, if either the grant or the percentage level on a tax base, were tweaked. <\/p> <p>  When people could only walk within a 3 km, 5 km, or 10 km limit, they engaged with their places.  Place-making, as well as where retail animation is within that place-making, will feature heavily.  I found it interesting - colleagues might share my view - that the engagement with trade and stakeholders has been active.  People have taken much more interest in what they are trying to achieve, and in what they want from their cities and counties.  That will feature heavily and the dialogue has been enriched.  It should feature heavily in the development plan process going forward.

I thank Deputy Bruton for his question and for his support previously at the commencement of the regional transition team process and its activation.  On the just transition process itself, progress has been slow.  That would be the perception of progress, both locally and throughout the region.  However, there have been significant activities around the just transition process.  We got engagement with the start team at EU level.  It engaged with communities locally.  There have been a number of recommendations and an action plan going forward to address some of those communities that are most impacted.  With regard to the just transition fund, it supports projects across three specific priority areas, namely, enterprise and employment; training and upskilling; and community transitioning.  There are Strand 1 and Strand 2 projects.  Strand 1 is for those under &euro;100,000.  Of those projects, 16 are currently in contract.  They are delivering.  The total value of those is &euro;1.2 million.  As reported under those 16 project plans, they will create 28 direct jobs and 175 indirect jobs.<\/p> <p>  Provisional offers were then made to 47 Strand 2 projects, which are those up to &euro;1 million.  All have undergone state aid assessment, etc.  It is a significant verification process.  There many hurdles for those projects to get over in that verification process.  However, at this stage, approximately 30% of those applications are in contract.  Work is ongoing with Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to get the rest of them over the line.  They are at varying stages of that process.  Some &euro;27 million was committed overall.  We do not know if all that will be drawn down.  We are seeking assurances on that and on what will happen to funds that are not drawn down.<\/p> <p>  The EU territorial plan is being prepared by the Department for submission.  That will go to Brussels for ratification.  There is &euro;77 million in that just transition fund allocated to Ireland.  With match funding and national funding, I think that brings it up &euro;150 million.  We ask that that will go to those communities that are most impacted.  We look forward to working with the Department further on that.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at the administration of funds in Offaly.  We are working with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to see if Offaly County Council can administer those funds to enable them to be rolled-out to those communities more quickly.  It has been approximately 12 months since applications were made.  It has been six months since the announcement of the successful projects.  This is a obviously significant issue for communities that have made applications, particularly in getting their match funding.  They have not been able to do local fundraising due to Covid-19.  There is, therefore, a match funding issue for a number of those.   We have been asking our Deputies and MEPs to look at that.  We have had a couple of meetings with MEPs in relation to the NUTS 3 region and the EU territorial plan.  These are progressing, but progress is slow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Marie Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Paul Murphy, who has seven minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#E00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.

Does that cause Limerick City and County Council to alter any of its existing plans?

We have kept in close contact with both the indigenous and the foreign direct investment markets to see what the trends were.  Their view is that the office market will maintain and that there is a role for the market and the office.  They believe that people may do transactional work at home and that where people are transacting or processing work, they may do part of that at remote locations.  However, for creativity, teamwork and strategising, people will still need spaces and offices.  The inside of the office may reconfigure but the pattern of office development or the need for offices will not change.  We are seeing that there is still a healthy pipeline in Limerick and we are still getting a lot of interest because the cost base is right.<\/p> <p>  We are benefiting from remote working in the sense that, through technology, people are beginning to relocate to Limerick or the mid-west to work.

I will speak about the living city initiative.  I am interested in hearing comments from Mr. Shakespeare but not about Dublin, which has been well covered this morning.  I am thinking more about my city of Waterford.  We are probably following the same narrative as other cities at the moment in trying to develop remote working opportunities, seeking to expand digital hubs and, hopefully, retain some of the outdoor amenity space we are developing, as well as developing public transport, access and all of that.  I agree with what Ms Farrelly said.  Much of this is predicated on jobs.  It is basically a chicken and egg situation.  If a place is not invested in, how can economic activity be created to drive job creation within it?<\/p> <p>  The living city initiative is not working in Waterford.  The reason for this is largely economic but we also have many old, listed buildings.  There is no benefit in giving property owners a tax break because there is no money to be made out of it in terms of a rental yield.  The question is how we get these properties back into use.  There are two hotels in Waterford at the moment, both of which are derelict.  The property owners are sitting on them and waiting for a market bounce.  In one case in particular, the economic tide has turned and one would imagine the owners would get going but the properties are sitting there despite dereliction notices and so on, which are not having the desired effect.

Limerick is akin to Waterford in size and scale.  To add to what Mr. Shakespeare said, we could look to the blending of a conversion to a grant or a raise, or look at the time period of the building and the percentage of the tax allowance.  We have had good dialogue and have gone door-to-door with our conservation and architectural teams, and talked and walked with the owners to challenge them to do more.  It has resulted in 20 or 25 buildings coming back into the market, either being redeveloped or being brought for sale to the market.  I can understand there is a great fear of using the scheme among some owners, developers, potential investors and even homeowners, which is that when they get into conservation of these old Georgian buildings, it will just be an open-ended bill.  We have been able to guide it very heavily, as Mr. Shakespeare has said.  We have been able to talk to property owners and, hopefully, give them some assurances.  We have given them design templates to help them.<\/p> <p>  When we started that process and dialogue it helped things along.  We were not the big, scary place where people felt they would just end up with a lot of costs, bills and regulation.  We turned it on its head and said to property owners that these are very important buildings that are part of our urban architecture and history and we wanted to work with them on it.  That kind of carrot approach has been better than the stick in this instance.

Its excellent report, The Future Development of Limerick City, painted a really positive picture of transforming Limerick into an urban environment where significantly higher numbers of individuals live in the city and others are attracted to visit and to participate in cultural, hospitality, educational and other activities.  It estimated that we would need 1,100 additional homes in the city each year.  I want to revisit the issue of the Opera Centre in that context.  The word \"balance\" has been mentioned.  I think we all agree that we have to get the balance right.

I will pass them on to my colleagues.  The chamber of commerce report, which was prepared by Indecon Consultants, was very useful as an insight into how they see the world, as an analysis of how Limerick might emerge and develop and as an input into the draft development plan for Limerick.  It identified that urban living, particularly in the city centre, needs to come up a level at pace.  We would agree with that and we are working through it.<\/p> <p>  For the benefit of other members of the committee, the Opera Centre site is a large 4-hectare site in the middle of the city that we are bringing forward.  We have a development company in Limerick called Limerick 2030 DAC.  It is probably Ireland's only public interest development company.  It is taking forward key sites that we felt would anchor the redevelopment and revitalisation of Limerick city centre.  We are now looking at other locations around the county as well.  The site will be mixed use.  It will primarily have public spaces.  In addition to a new building for Revenue, which is expanding in Limerick, there will be a new library centre, an innovation office block, an aparthotel, some retail, a neighbourhood centre and some limited residential development, involving the conversion of a Georgian area.<\/p> <p>  That is only one site and there are many others we are working through.  A great deal of attention has been paid to the mixed-use aspect of the Opera Centre site.  Much of it is under negotiation which I probably cannot get into.  We have nearly all the blocks in dialogue with possible investors and owners.  Work is continuing on other key sites around the city centre, some of which are in our ownership and some of which we are working on with the private sector, to bring forward apartment living and social, affordable and student schemes.  I acknowledge that we have lacked such schemes in Limerick.  Our planning has not been confined to the Indecon report, on which we worked very closely with the chamber of commerce, with which we have a strong relationship as a stakeholder.  We have also worked with KPMG Future Analytics on our own reporting as part of the development plan process.<\/p> <p>  On an economic and spatial basis, we are asking what else is needed and how the mix works.  We probably need seven or eight new sites that would have social and affordable aspects along with more commercial and residential aspects.  That is where the next phase of the plan will be.  We spoke earlier about animating the city centre, what the change in the mix of retail and living will be, and where the night economy meets that.  I think that will be the next phase for Limerick.  It is quite an exciting phase.  I think there is a lot of interest in the public consultation around the draft development plan.  That came through very clearly.  It is very interesting that both reports we have been working with have come up with that as a finding.  While I agree with what the Senator has said, it will be not be confined to the Opera Centre.  We are a long way down the road in the Opera Centre - on-site works are taking place and development agreements have almost been finalised on several of the key buildings.

As we want people to be more animated in the city centre and to come to the city, we will have to look at the provision of public toilets and facilities.

So many schemes have come through the county councils.  They have tried to get them out to businesses and communities as quickly as possible.  I am sure it has not been easy but it has been done very well.  Many rural towns in my own county of Tipperary, such as Cahir and Cashel, and around the country have been enhanced on the back of the outdoor dining scheme.

I refer to the relationship of local authorities with Irish Water.  It seems to me that the priorities of many local authorities within their county do not align with the priorities of Irish Water for the county.  Is that difficult to align?  Where do our guests see that going?   It seems to me that the priorities of local authorities relate to economic growth whereas those of Irish Water relate to environmental aspects.  We cannot attract people into rural Ireland, to counties such as Tipperary and elsewhere, unless Irish Water and local authorities are aligned.

What are their views in that regard internally going forward?  Those targets set down in the White Paper are quite ambitious.<\/p><p> Reference was made to remote working hubs.  It is really positive and very welcome.  I am a huge supporter of such hubs in County Tipperary.  It is all well and good to have remote working hubs in place, but there is a need for them to be managed.  What role can be played by local authorities in the management of remote working hubs?<\/p><p> Several speakers touched on rural regeneration and the amount of funding that has come through the rural regeneration and urban regeneration funds.  Obviously, costs have gone up in the past year but it seems to me that there is a difficulty in respect of the rural regeneration projects, rather than the urban regeneration projects.  Is that the experience of county councils in terms of getting extra funding because of increased costs?  I know Ms Farrelly stated that most projects are up and running but it seems that they are progressing more slowly than was hoped.  Obviously, we are in the pandemic but, leaving that aside, do our guests believe there is a requirement for extra staff to get these projects moving?

My colleagues may also wish to respond.<\/p> <p>  As regards housing, there are ongoing discussions with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding what the new targets may be under the new plan for housing which I understand will be launched in the coming month.  As to whether there is more we can do, we are trying to utilise every avenue for housing delivery, including direct build by the council, working with approved housing bodies, AHBs, and pursuing public private partnerships where they are a smart solution in certain circumstances.  The Senator asked about the LDA.  I do not think there can be too many actors involved in housing provision at this time in terms of ramping up housing supply.  The LDA will play its part in that regard.  It certainly has a big part to play in the provision of affordable rental and affordable housing.  We are all mobilising to do more.  Housing supply can be difficult to get off the ground but we in Fingal, for example, have sites on which we can deliver 3,000 units in the coming years.  These are sites on which we are actively involved in planning or design and hope to get to site on most of them very quickly.  We are already on site in some of the developments.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right with regard to the alignment of priorities across all infrastructure providers.  Land activation requires everybody to be working to the same programme and delivering on time in order to get development happening, whether that is commercial or housing.  There is no doubt that active engagement with the likes of Irish Water to ensure it is doing the right projects in one's area at the right time is the only way we can get sites active.  There is a significant amount of work ongoing in that area.  I am not sure it is as difficult as the Senator suggested.  More probably needs to be done with regard to communication to make sure priorities line up on time, but it has happened quite well in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure I will comment on the staffing issue relating to Irish Water.  It is the subject of ongoing discussion and we might let that take its course in terms of the White Paper.<\/p> <p>  We are engaged in the management of remote working hubs but it is not our wish to staff them ourselves.  Some of my colleagues may wish to come in on this issue.  Ms Delaney may have further information on it.  Most of the hubs will work to a business plan that allows the doors to be open, so to speak, but we assist and are very often involved in the overall management structure for the hubs to ensure they run efficiently.<\/p> <p>  As regards the rural regeneration and development fund and the urban regeneration and development fund, the most frustrating part of any project is design, planning and procurement.  There is no avoiding it in respect of all these projects but it can be frustrating not to see work happening on the ground.  We are working through that for many of the projects.  Obviously, increased costs are a concern and something we will have to keep under review.  The increase in cost happened quite quickly and we do not know where it will bottom out.  Most projects are currently in the design phase, which can be slow.

I refer to the retention of skills in terms of tradespeople.   I have been speaking to several developers and smaller builders in recent months.  It is becoming quite apparent that the current costs in the building sector are very unlikely to unwind because of planning regulations and specifications.  It is going to make housing unaffordable, particularly outside Dublin.  As I stated previously, in Waterford we do not have high-quality jobs like those available in Dublin and affordability is already a very significant issue despite the fact that the housing market has moved on.  Affordability is the central problem.  We are trying to get houses built under the affordability scheme.  A significant amount of social housing is being planned but not a lot of private housing is being done, apart from one-off builds.  What can local authorities do to ensure they have capacity in that regard?  We are hearing that local authorities should be building.  We know there is no capacity within local authorities currently to take on build projects.<\/p><p>It is all done by tender through third parties.

Due to Brexit and distribution issues, we are currently having problems sourcing product, which is impacting on some contracts.  However, the feeling is that as Brexit and distribution issues are addressed, as deliveries ease and product gets easier to find, some of the cost will come back in.  That should alleviate some of the pressures.  In time, as we emerge from the Covid pandemic and come through Brexit, the hope is that we will get the cost back in a relatively straight line and there will be more manageable inflation on some of the contracts.  That is what we are hoping for.  There are some good examples of that.  We have a development arm in Limerick in terms of the public interest works.  Even if councils want to get back into the building game directly, it is very difficult because the staffing is not there.  We will see a lot more special purpose vehicles or joint venture type arrangements that will accelerate the delivery of housing in the future, but it will need to be properly thought out.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, in the case of the Limerick development draft plan, and it may be common to other development plans in trying to address and even get round the issues Senator Ahearn mentioned in respect of Irish Water, where service sites or small clusters emerge, a lot of that is ready-made for small builders and procurement through smaller framework contracts.  We will seek to make some schemes available so that smaller builders can come in.  They will be the right fit for such projects.  The larger density projects will be built by the larger commercial interests.<\/p> <p>  There will probably be a blended approach.  A one-size-fits-all approach will not be the solution.  There will be individual solutions, not just in different locations but in different areas within locations.  For example, county towns will have a different approach from a city or metropolitan area.  It will be a matter of how we structure or organise around that rather than getting involved in building directly.  There may might be a different organisation of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Dr. Daly mentioned small builders.

First, I commend Dr. Daly and the staff in Limerick City and County Council.  They have done the best they can in the past year, which has been very difficult for everyone.  They have done a really good job.  Limerick itself is looking well at the moment.  I was there at the weekend.  It is buzzing again for the first time in a long time.  It is great to see.<\/p> <p>  I have a few queries on the living city initiative.  Obviously, there is a huge Georgian centre in Limerick and a medieval centre around the Nicholas Street area.  What could the Government do to make it easier to bring many of those properties back into use?  I know Dr. Daly said quite a few properties have been brought back into use.  I believe the total is 25.  I have seen some of them myself.  The quality is excellent and the properties have been finished very well.  How do we make it easier for those properties to be brought back into use?  As Dr. Daly will be aware, there is a lot of dereliction, particularly in the Georgian area and Nicholas Street.  Although many of the properties on Nicholas Street have been addressed, there is a lot more to do there.<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns Arthur's Quay.  Is there any specific plan to do something with Arthur's Quay?  We need to reimagine the city in light of the Covid pandemic and the fact we are emerging from it.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the Cleeve's site, would the local authority consider putting social and affordable housing on the Cleeve's site?  To be honest, I do not see any other potential development for that area.<\/p> <p>  My final question concerns infrastructure and the very welcome redevelopment of O'Connell Street.  Has the council had any significant discussions or does it plan to change the initial development plan?  Obviously, the plan was agreed before the Covid-19 pandemic and things have changed during the pandemic.  Will there be any changes to the outcome of the redevelopment of O'Connell Street and the surrounding area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#L01000","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his kind words.  We are happy to pass them on to colleagues.  In respect of the living city initiative there are two aspects to consider.  We could look at the time bands within it, what buildings fall into it and what buildings could be included.  A study of the impact across the sites and the city may be beneficial in that respect.  We could also look at the tax treatment within the scheme, specifically a potential increase in allowances or, as Mr. Shakespeare and Ms Farrelly mentioned previously, a possible conversion to a grant mechanism.  There is an opportunity in the scheme.  To get it to the scale people are talking about, it would need a rethink and a part overhaul.  However, it could withstand that.  It is probably the last of that particular type of urban regeneration programme that could benefit from a rethink or a tweak.  It is perhaps something to look at as we go into the budget cycle towards the end of the year.  With some changes, strong communication and perhaps some local management, it could work very well.<\/p><p>Arthur's Quay is a sister site adjacent to the Opera site in Limerick.  We are working with a number of partners at the site regarding how it could be developed.  That work is ongoing.  I believe there are opportunities.  Abutting that site is the site for the university campus in the city centre.  There is a ring of development emerging.  Arthur's Quay will be redeveloped as part of that programme, which is exciting because one can see where the city centre is nearly shifting down to that riverside area and the waterfront, which was supported under the urban regeneration and development fund and the Government's schemes.  Limerick received some &euro;116 million to make that happen.  It will be a significant project.<\/p><p> The Cleeves' site is in master planning and the consultants are looking at that.  I imagine they will look at all options around residential, mixed use and commercial, and how that mix will be.  It will most definitely be looked at for social and affordable.<\/p><p> On the infrastructure of O'Connell Street, we are on-site and we are disrupting Limerick city centre a little bit at the moment.  I am sure our traders are hopeful.  They have been very patient so far and with a little bit more patience we will get the benefit.  There have not been many changes because we are working to the panning permission on it and we must be careful of it.  The revitalisation project was designed to cater for more pedestrianisation, a reduced thoroughfare, a specific public transport lane, a reduction to one motor lane from the current two lanes and a lot more paving animation on the public side.  Once we get through the works and people begin to see each phase emerge, hopefully they will be very impressed and happy with it.  It will really future-proof the main street in Limerick.  It will be quite exciting.

I welcome Lord Jay of Ewelme, Lord Caine, Baroness Goudie, Lord Hain, Baroness O'Loan and Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick.  Without putting too much pressure on the sub-committee, Lord Jay has a formidable team.  I know to be careful with the word \"experience\" because it can be mistaken for referring to one's age, but there is experience and wisdom among the members of that team.  I have worked closely with a number of them in different chapters of my own political career.  We are looking forward to their contributions and engagement.<\/p> <p>  This meeting is timely.

I am the chair of the House of Lords committee on the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland.  I previously served as a member of the House of Lords European Union committee, which had since the EU referendum in 2016 conducted intensive scrutiny of the implementation of Brexit for Northern Ireland and Ireland.  I was pleased, in the context of that work, to visit the Oireachtas on a number of occasions, and to have met many Members.  It is a real pleasure to be with them again.<\/p> <p>  Following the UK withdrawal from the EU and the end of the transition period, the term of appointment of the EU committee came to an end on 31 March this year.  The House of Lords appointed in its place a new European affairs committee, to scrutinise all aspects of the UK-EU relationship.  In view of the technically complex and politically sensitive provisions of the Northern Ireland protocol, the House of Lords also agreed to appoint a committee to scrutinise all aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol, as a sub-committee to the European affairs committee.  Both committees began their work in April. <\/p> <p>  The protocol committee includes a wide range of views and expertise, as the Chair rightly said, both on Northern Ireland and on the protocol itself.  Our membership includes senior representatives of political parties in Northern Ireland, including former party leaders and deputy leaders, from both unionist and nationalist perspectives.  It draws on wider expertise in the House of Lords, including a former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, a former specialist adviser to successive Secretaries of State, and a former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  Many of these voices are represented in our delegation today.  My colleagues will introduce themselves the first time they speak.  I should add that Lord Empey had hoped to participate today but had to withdraw at the last moment.  <\/p> <p>  The committee has identified six core tasks within its remit: document-based scrutiny of new or amended EU legislation within the scope of the protocol that will apply to Northern Ireland; scrutiny of the implications of relevant domestic UK legislation and policy for Northern Ireland in relation to the protocol; scrutiny of the Northern Ireland-related work of the governance bodies established under the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, including the joint committee, the Ireland-Northern Ireland specialised committee and the joint consultative working group; monitoring the protocol&rsquo;s political and socioeconomic impact on Northern Ireland; reviewing the ongoing impact of the protocol, and of UK withdrawal from the EU more broadly, on the UK-Ireland bilateral relationship; and developing interparliamentary dialogue in relation to the protocol, including with the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas. <\/p> <p>  The committee has identified monitoring the protocol&rsquo;s political and socioeconomic impact on Northern Ireland as its key initial priority.  To that end, we have launched an introductory inquiry into the current state of play on the protocol, taking account of developments since it came into force on 1 January 2021.  Over the past few weeks, we have heard oral evidence from business leaders, community and civic society representatives, academic and legal experts and political commentators.  We also have received a range of written evidence, including from businesses, political parties, and the ambassador of Ireland in London.  Tomorrow, the European affairs committee will hear evidence from the EU ambassador to the UK.  On 14 July 2021, in our final session for this inquiry, we will hear from Lord Frost, on behalf of the UK Government.  We aim to publish our report at the end of July.  We will then take forward more detailed scrutiny of individual issues in the autumn, taking full account of political developments in the meantime. <\/p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s meeting is a welcome opportunity to strengthen interparliamentary dialogue between the Oireachtas and Westminster, and between our two committees.  I hope that we will be able to build on this engagement in the coming months including, as Covid-19 restrictions ease &ndash; we hope - by meeting in person, both in Dublin and in London.  We look forward to answering your questions about our work.

I strongly support informal contact and building personal relationships.  The Chair mentioned the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which is one example.  When I was Secretary of State the personal relationships between the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, was crucial to the progress made during Tony Blair's ten years of premiership on peace, on the Good Friday Agreement and on the 2007 settlement that brought Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness into shared power.  We should not underestimate the importance of informal contacts.  They seem to have ebbed away in recent years from Brussels to London, where trust is at the lowest ebb that I can remember in the last few decades.  I also believe that trust between Dublin and London has been breached massively and frankly, personally I think that more than 90% of that is due to the behaviour of London.  Given the history of relations between the UK and Ireland, I think it is crucial that we try to re-establish that trust.<\/p><p>Whether it is a case of parliamentarian-to-parliamentarian relationships, including those between Members of the European Parliament and those in Stormont, all of these relationships need to be developed.<\/p><p> Our committee heard evidence, which I favour and of which I took great note, that there would be a great benefit if Stormont Assembly members had direct relationships with Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Oireachtas.  Similarly, it would be beneficial if the Northern Ireland Executive had a direct relationship with Brussels because the European Commission, European Parliament and European Council are responsible for regulations that apply in Northern Ireland.

Some weeks ago, we heard evidence on the economic impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland, both North and South, on the impact of the protocol and the need for political and economic stability.  Those are the points that arose continuously.  Of vital importance is the informal contact we already have with one another as parliamentarians.  It is important that we build on it.  I am aware, from living in Ireland and the North, that it is important that we engage with our colleagues in the Oireachtas, be they in the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  It is vital that we gain an understanding and communicate the issues.  I recall the engagement by my party colleagues in the days of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and during the development of the Good Friday Agreement.  The relationship between the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and the then UK Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, was vital.  Those relationships were excellent.  Relationships in the past couple of years between Britain and Ireland have sadly deteriorated.  I would lie that largely at the door of the British Government but we now have to move to circumstances in which those relationships are enhanced.

The various Secretaries of State with whom I worked co-operated very closely with Mr. Eamon Gilmore, Deputy Charles Flanagan and the current Minister for Foreign Affairs.

In 2014, I remember having to get something to Mr. David Cameron very quickly about the Stormont House talks and he just happened to be with Mr. Enda Kenny at a European Council meeting.  They were able to get together very quickly and come back with a very quick joint response, which was really helpful.  There is probably a need to use the existing British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference more frequently or, possibly, if some people in Northern Ireland have sensitivities about that, think about some new institutional structures through which we could continue to deepen and strengthen the bilateral relationship between our two countries, which, as others have said, is crucial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Caine"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1624402800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I would push back a bit on the extent to which people think the situation has deteriorated in recent years.

It is great to have this engagement with the committee.  People have spoken about the relationship and while there might be a different view as to how bad the east-west relationship is, some elements of trust may be lacking.  I will put my cards on the table.  My view of what I am hearing from the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the Secretary of State, Lord David Frost, is what I would say has happened here for probably centuries in the sense that even when we think we have a deal with the British Government there is always an attempt at a renegotiation even after the fact.<\/p> <p>  With Boris Johnson, we just do not know if it is a play to his home base.  Is he serious about what he says about the Irish protocol?  It adds to instability.  We know there are difficulties in unionism.  I believe those difficulties relate to the fact that unionists have never had to move beyond the lowest common denominator within their own base and they are now losing support to their left and right flanks.  Whatever about the Irish language Act, agreements made many years ago and solutions that have been found to that, they have settled on the Irish protocol as being a major issue to wrap the Union Jack around themselves.  What they hear from Boris Johnson and Lord David Frost gives them false succour.  I would put the Irish protocol in the same framework as the Good Friday Agreement.  They are international agreements and they are not going anywhere.  I accept that certain things need to be streamlined.  <\/p> <p>  I lost my connection to the meeting for a minute or two and may have missed some interaction.  I apologise if I am repeating what someone else may have said.  What are the possibilities of an SPS deal on animal and veterinary issues that would address a significant number of the protocol issues?  That is accepting that there are enough modalities and committees between the EU and the British Government to deal with this issue.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that Lord Hain spoke about the democratic deficit in respect of the North.  When the trade and co-operation agreement went through the European Parliament there was a resolution that there needs to be some element of Northern representation or engagement.  We would have played our part on that.  We need to ensure that happens.  Do the witnesses believe the British Government would consider another unilateral action?  Could we have some sort of deal?  An SPS deal may be on the cards.<\/p> <p>  Boris Johnson is considering an amnesty for members of state forces regarding actions that occurred during the conflict.  Many people here, particularly nationalists throughout the island, believe that the British Government is never willing to accept or own up to its role in collusion between state forces and loyalist killer gangs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#D00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I will hand over to Lord Jay of Ewelme.

In these free trade deals it is clear the Conservative Government is determined to strike free trade deals which do not automatically align with EU SPS standards.  That is a major problem, but a bit of goodwill could be applied on both sides, which means Lord Frost and Boris Johnson removing unilateral threats to renege on legal agreements they have made, which is what the protocol is.  They signed up to it and either knew the detail, including SPS, or they did not and signed it with their eyes shut.  It requires goodwill from Brussels, London and, to the extent that it is a factor, Dublin.  There should be common sense applied.  The crucial thing is trust.  The EU has subcontracted to the UK, and this is unique, responsibility for policing its external frontier across the Irish Sea.  That is a big part of the protocol and it can only operate on trust.  That trust could be to rebuild and a lighter touch application of the protocol introduced, including on SPS issues, which, as Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; implied, would deal with 80% of the problem.

Lord Jay said in his initial remarks that this is a &quot;technically complex and politically sensitive&quot; matter.  That is an understatement.  We need to go back to basics.  The protocol was to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  It has nothing to do with the constitutional position of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.  That gets lost in the debate.  Paul Johnston, the British ambassador to Ireland, writes today in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>about the need for a reasonable, pragmatic, proportionate approach to make the protocol sustainable.  He outlines a number of things the UK Government is undertaking, including investment in ports, assisting businesses and so on.

Northern Ireland businesses can export freely to both Britain and the EU Single Market.  There are huge advantages for businesses in Northern Ireland arising from the protocol.  There is dual access to UK and EU markets for Northern Ireland's businesses.  However, as Baroness O'Loan said, there is a need for political stability as well.<\/p><p>That is something that all of us have to work on and ensure.

I co-chaired, with Northern Ireland's Minister of Finance, the special EU programme bodies that distributed both the PEACE funds and the regional development funds.<\/p> <p>  It is important, because we are in public session, to state that one of the terms of reference of Lord Jay's committee is to have an understanding of the perspective of the Oireachtas in relation to the protocol.  There is a consensus view across all shades of opinion and parties in the Oireachtas which is against Brexit because that was always going to be a disruptor, and a consensus that the type of exit should be minimally disruptive to relations between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Unfortunately, the most severe form of Brexit, exiting the Single Market and customs union, was the path chosen.  That was always going to cause a problem because if both of our jurisdictions were to be in separate customs unions, there was going to have to be a point of division, either on the Irish Sea or the island of Ireland.  It was inevitable.  That is why we have a protocol.  We spent four years trying to find a solution to that question, which simply could not be avoided.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that real issues have emerged from negotiations.  People have talked about sanitary and phytosanitary agreements, the importation of meat products that may enter the European Single Market which may be a cause of concern, and so on.  The witnesses have presented much evidence.  My fundamental question is about the growing consensus view in the UK Parliament about mechanisms to resolve those issues.  It seems to me that there are two positions.  I think the consensus position in the Oireachtas is that all these issues can be resolved within the architecture of the protocol and the mechanisms of dialogue that are there.  We have had discussions with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, who is flexible in all of these matters.  Are there issues which are fundamentally unresolvable?  In that case, the protocol itself must be either set aside or fundamentally altered.  Those are two definitive positions.  We need to know which approach is being taken by the British Government and Parliament.  We can resolve matters by dialogue through the mechanisms available, flexibilities, understandings and the talking process.  From a political perspective, there are those who want to exploit difficulties for political reasons.  If it is determined that these matters must be resolved by setting aside the protocol, we have a fundamental issue that we need to talk about separately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#F00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies.

That said, the economic issues which the Deputy raised are important.  The fact that Northern Ireland will be within the UK single market and the EU Single Market provides an opportunity, if peace and stability can be established, for investment in Northern Ireland, which will really help the economy and people of Northern Ireland.  That is an important goal.  I regret that more emphasis has not been put on that point in the negotiations which we have had about the protocol and the future of Northern Ireland.

Our chair, Lord Jay, is right.  We are in the midst of building our report.  We are taking evidence and have taken evidence on various aspects.  From a personal point of view, I agree with the protocol.  The Deputy is right that it was put in place to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  There is no way that it interferes with the constitutional position of the North with the rest of Britain.  The Deputy is correct about it.  As Baroness O'Loan has said, some people have deliberately or unwittingly, not understanding the implications of the protocol, used that for the violence we have seen and mixed it into the divided society, thereby causing more upset and upheaval, as we have seen in the last few weeks.  There is no doubt that we need political and economic stability.  That is an overriding concern.  Those are my personal views but I think some of them may emerge in our report, if I may be a little cheeky in that respect.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Haughey raised the issue of foreign investment.  There are benefits.  Last week, Mike Johnston of the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland gave evidence.  It was in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>.  There have been significant benefits to the dairy industry from the protocol, which is really an all-Ireland industry now because much of the milk from the North is being sent to the South for processing at Lakeland Dairies, and comes back north in the form of cheese, milk or whatever other form of dairy product.  That has been active for many years and is increasing.  Just yesterday, we were told that Dale Farm, a Northern dairy processor, has actually got a contract with Arla Foods, the Danish company, which is one of the benefits of the protocol.  The guy who was interviewed on BBC's programme &quot;Evening Extra&quot; last night, Mr. Whelan, emphasised that that was a benefit from the protocol.<br\/><br\/>I will move on to Deputy Howlin's question.  He talked about the need for economic and political stability.  When we took evidence from Stephen Kelly of Manufacturing NI, he was able to underpin the increased level of investment between the North and Europe as a result of the protocol.  That means jobs in a post-pandemic global economy, which can only be good for all of us.  It has benefits for the whole island.  The Deputy talked about the UK Parliament.  There are different views in the House of Lords.  There are those of us who want to see political and economic stability between Britain and Ireland and to see those good relationships nurtured.  Notwithstanding my personal preference for uniting the people of this island, which we are not discussing today, there is a genuine concern about some of the damage that has been caused by Brexit and, above all, the need for a resolution.<\/p><p>That resolution could be found in a sanitary and phytosanitary measures agreement, a food supply agreement that would resolve the sausage war to which Deputy Haughey referred, the medicines agreement and an EU office in Belfast to help those better relations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I invite Lord Caine to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I find myself agreeing with a great deal of what has been said.  Deputy Haughey is absolutely right to raise the issue of economic investment and economic opportunities.  Members may correct me if I am wrong, but at the start of the year, Brandon Lewis, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, was talking about Northern Ireland benefiting from having the best of both worlds in respect of the protocol.  Obviously, that was before some of the issues to which Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick referred, such as the so-called sausage wars and so on, became apparent.  I hope we can get to a situation where we iron out some of the difficulties with the protocol.  It is not just a Northern Ireland issue.  I read yesterday about the difficulty that smaller food manufacturers are having in supplying Northern Ireland markets, which is putting pressure on their businesses in Great Britain because of the difficulties involved.  I very much hope that if we could iron out the difficulties, applying pragmatism, proportionality, common sense and all of that, we could start trumpeting some of the opportunities Northern Ireland has.  Let us be honest, we all know that economic prosperity and stability is one of the surest ways of underpinning peace in Northern Ireland.  I note that a week or so ago, the Prime Minister appointed Mr. Trevor Ringland, who is well known to many taking part in this meeting, as a special envoy to the United States, with a specific inward investment remit.  I very much endorse the remarks of Deputy Haughey in respect of the opportunities that could be available for Northern Ireland if we can iron out some of these difficulties.<\/p> <p>  As regards the comments of Deputy Howlin in respect of where the consensus lies in Westminster, Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick is correct in stating there are very different views.  If I were to hazard a guess, most members of my party would be assuaged if the difficulties about which we are hearing could be dealt with, but there is probably a smaller number who fundamentally object to the protocol for all sorts of political and constitutional reasons.  What we should be seized of is very much the extent to which this issue now is contributing to political instability in Northern Ireland and, therefore, it is incumbent on everybody to do whatever they can to sort it out, frankly, before the situation gets any worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Lord Caine"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Caine and ask Baroness Goudie to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Jay of Ewelme"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleagues but we all know that investment in Northern Ireland, not just from the UK but from the whole of Europe, America, Canada and other countries, is vital because we cannot let young people not be eligible to get work, apprenticeships, proper jobs and proper training.

We have been able to keep relations civil, even with those throughout these islands with whom we disagree most, and, crucially, disagree without being disagreeable.  I stress the importance of and opportunity that lies in improving the bilateral work between Ireland and the UK.  I know many of those present are lucky enough to be members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I am really enthused that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is to meet next week and the British-Irish Council met last week.  I was extremely disappointed that several meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council did not go ahead due to what was, to be frank, a political boycott.  That is something of which we all need to take ownership as parliamentarians and really stress the need for those institutions to be non-negotiable.  Those strand 3 institutions are so important to the workings of relations on these islands and the Good Friday Agreement, but they also provide an opportunity, particularly on the Irish side, that no other EU member state has to have a level of bilateral relationship that can be quite special and mutually beneficial.  I hope we can get agreement.  The point has been made on several occasions at this committee that the institutions should be formalised.  The British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference cannot go years without meeting.  They have to meet every time they are scheduled to do so and be put in the diary simply as matter-of-fact meetings.  As several people have mentioned, the ability for Irish and British Ministers to have meetings on the margins of European Council meetings is gone.  The ability for us, as parliamentarians, to have supplementary meetings at the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, is maintained but they are not necessarily as substantive.  We ought to put pressure on Ministers in both Governments, particularly the British Government, for those meetings to be scheduled and take place much more regularly.  It would be reassuring if it was the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister alone who attends in future on behalf of the British Government.  That would be a good statement of intent.<\/p> <p>  Many of the issues I wished to raise have been covered.  My colleague, Senator Joe O'Reilly, who is from Bailieboro, will be delighted to hear Lakelands Dairy get a shout-out.  When I was buttering my toast this morning, I noticed the butter was from Lakelands Dairy.  I do not know whether the cow was from Cavan or Fermanagh, but it was good butter regardless.  This is about considering the real impact on those who are on the ground in Northern Ireland.  All present have acknowledged there are difficulties, which are not being helped by rhetoric from certain politicians, including certain British Government Ministers.  I was quite disappointed to hear the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, during a meeting parallel to this one, again say that the protocol will be changed.  I must be very critical of Lord Frost, a House of Lords colleague of our guests, for his approach to these issues in recent weeks.  It has been unhelpful.  I do not see the relevance of his comments or how a person who negotiated these agreements and has had a very respectable career as a diplomat can go into the political arena and trash for domestic audiences something he has negotiated, forgetting that those of us in the EU read and speak pretty good English.<\/p><p>I would look for the actual on-the-ground real impact of the work of this committee, not necessarily the headlines.  Some 400 people at a protest in Newtownards can sound very menacing and create a lot of reaction, but what are the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland, unionist, nationalist or other, actually thinking?  As many people have said at length, including Deputy Haughey, are people in Northern Ireland looking at the benefits that the protocol provides?  That is real challenge for Trevor Ringland in his new role.<\/p><p> I am certainly struck by the repeated comments from Matthew O'Toole in the Assembly.  He seems to be beating a very lone drum about wanting investments to come into Northern Ireland to make the most of the protocol.  I do not agree, as some people have said, that the protocol is the best of both worlds but it is not a bad situation.  Certainly, if a common-sense approach is taken, which many of us at this meeting have demonstrated today, there is huge potential in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#G00800","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>It is interesting to hear that a man with a young child in the house has time to butter and eat toast in the morning.

That is the answer to that question.<\/p> <p>  I will make another point about contact.  This goes back a little to my background, but I attended something like 15 European Council meetings in a row as a senior official in the Foreign Office.  From the time of Mrs. Thatcher through to that of Tony Blair, on at least half of those occasions the most important thing was not the discussion of European Union issues but the bilateral discussion between the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.  One of the things we need to do now, in a sense, is to replace those sorts of informal, completely below the radar discussions which happened automatically every three to six months often without anybody knowing about them.  That is an issue for all of us.<\/p> <p>  I am glad to see that almost every member of the committee has got their hand up.

Senator Chambers asked about political instability and Deputy Richmond finished up on the same issue.  We have already talked about it to some small degree.  Part of the problem of political instability lies in a perception among some people in Northern Ireland, possibly quite a few, that the Government in Westminster does not care what happens in Northern Ireland so long as the problem goes away.  The Westminster Government is not perceived as always acting as honest brokers.  That is a major problem for stability here.<\/p> <p>  I had the privilege to serve for three years as a special envoy for Ireland to Timor-Leste.  It was a unique situation to have a northerner doing this, but it was a privilege and I saw at close quarters the workings of the Irish Government and Civil Service.  Wherever those opportunities are seized, they can enhance stability, but it has to be done in a way which embraces all the people of Northern Ireland.  It cannot just be nationalist and republican parties in Northern Ireland who are engaging with the Irish Government.  It has to be the other way round.  Our politicians here from the other parties have to engage with that and accept it as a reality.  It is in their financial and economic interests to do so.<\/p> <p>  The issues of developing stability and economic success in Northern Ireland absolutely go hand in hand.  One cannot proceed without the other.  Everybody has to accept that; it is in everybody's interests.  We do not want to slip back into the kind of thing that some of the loyalists, for example, are threatening us with and that the dissident republicans are continuing to inflict on us.  There is a very real need for the two to meet together and for all the institutions, whether they are North-South committees or British-Irish commissions, to seize every opportunity on every occasion to demonstrate to the people of Northern Ireland a coherent respect for the working relationship between the Governments in Northern Ireland, Ireland and Westminster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Baroness O'Loan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>On Senator Chambers's question about political stability in Northern Ireland, I honestly believe that if we did not have the protocol, there would still have been elements of political instability in the North because there was a lot of disgruntlement on the part of the unionist-loyalist community.  The origins of this lie with other issues to do with the marching season and so on.  That is what I find as a former Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive with particular responsibility for housing in urban Belfast.<\/p> <p>  To achieve political stability, the most important thing is that politicians on all sides need to dial down the rhetoric in the North, between Britain and Northern Ireland and between Britain and Ireland.  We need to get back down to the basics of what matters to the people, which is delivering for them and being able to achieve to underpin that level of political and economic stability.  The European Union and the UK need to have direct discussions with the Irish Government, the parties in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive.  It is only when there was persistent and consistent dialogue and an understanding emerged of the various issues and positions that we had that level of political stability.<\/p> <p>  I happen to agree with Deputy Richmond.  Those elements for political and economic stability lie in the features and institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, such as the Northern Ireland Executive, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the North South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  It is vitally important those structures of the agreement meet continually and that they move away from the scripted agendas that mean they are inclined to be dictated to by civil servants.  I speak as a former Minister and that was my personal experience.  There needs to be constant participation in the North South Ministerial Council and meetings should not be cancelled because certain Ministers cannot attend.  If the principal Minister in a given instance is from Sinn F&eacute;in or the SDLP, therefore there has to be an accompanying unionist Minister.  It should be mandatory that Ministers attend and subscribe to all the institutions because that was the ministerial pledge of office they took, to abide by the rules of their office.  The same is true of the other position.  If the principal Minister is a unionist, either from the Ulster Unionist Party or the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and the accompanying Minister is from a nationalist perspective, then that should be allowed to happen.<\/p> <p>  I believe that good outcomes happen when issues are discussed, whether they are about Brexit and the protocol or the climate emergency.  There have been very beneficial discussions because problems do not stop at the Border.  They can very much be of a cross-Border nature.  It is vitally important all those institutions, such as the North South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council, meet very regularly.  I have no doubt many of the issues we have encountered relating to the protocol and Brexit could have been ironed out by a greater level of understanding and appreciation of the other person's, or party's, point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I will address the question from Senator Chambers.  My earlier answer probably demonstrated that I am concerned about political stability in Northern Ireland.  I agree with much of what Baroness Ritchie said.  The issues around the protocol have been a major contributory factor in recent weeks and months but there are long-standing grievances within loyalism, some of which go back to the immediate aftermath of the Agreement in 1998.  Although I do not agree with it, there is a perception that many loyalists have that the Agreement has worked for nationalists and republicans but has somewhat left them behind.<\/p> <p>  I remember drafting a speech in 2014 in the immediate aftermath of the flag process, during which the disorder was on a far worse scale than we saw some months ago.  The speech was my attempt to do a version of the scene from the Monty Python film where the characters ask what the Romans have ever done for them.  I asked what the Belfast Agreement has delivered for loyalism.  Actually, if we look at the list, it is a long one.  I remember at a select committee Tony Blair was asked what the Good Friday Agreement delivered for unionism.  The first answer was the union.  There are long-standing grievances within loyalism.  They relate not only to the protocol but other issues that we need to try to address.<\/p> <p>  I believe Deputy Richmond and Baroness Ritchie have demonstrated above all that the Agreement is three-stranded.  All parts of that agreement are essential and interlocking.  One of the problems I found in engaging with Brussels is that those involved tend to see the Agreement almost exclusively through the prism of strand two and they downplay the east-west dimension.  If there is anything that colleagues could do to try to gently address that, it would be most helpful.  It is three-stranded and all three strands are vital and interlocking.  All have to work.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address one point on the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The history relates to the immediate aftermath of the St. Andrew's Agreement, for which Lord Hain was responsible, to his credit, and the re-establishment of devolved government.  A decision was taken at the time by the then British Government that the BIIGC should not meet regularly because of unionist sensitivities.  After 2010 we continued that.  To be honest, we did not come under much pressure from Dublin or any other quarter for the conference to meet regularly until after devolution fell in 2017.  Then, the BIIGC met more regularly.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Richmond.  As I said in an earlier answer, we need a strong institutional mechanism for the bilateral relationship between the UK and Ireland, whether that means more regular meetings of the BIIGC or a new institutional arrangement.  My view is not set in stone on which of these it should be, but we definitely need institutional arrangements for the bilateral relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Lord Caine"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I do not have many more comments.

I agree completely with what Lord Caine said.  I believe it was a mistake in retrospect not to have more regular meetings of the BIIGC and the British-Irish Council.  To be frank, often we did not get every top Cabinet Minister, including the UK Prime Minister, present at these bodies.  That was as true under Labour Governments as under Conservative ones.  I will come back to this because Deputy Richmond specifically addressed the point.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with the question from Deputy Chambers.  I believe the political instability at present is serious.  It is not all to do with the protocol.  I agree with what Lord Caine said about that.  It has been there for several years.  Anyway, it is serious.  I am using my words carefully.  It is important for nationalists and republicans, whatever side of the Border they are on, to be careful at the moment.  This is because unionism feels extremely insecure, especially loyalism.  As Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and ever since, I have tried to play an honest broker role.  It seems to me that is the key duty of any British Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and, for that matter, their colleagues in government.  Their duty is to be genuine honest brokers in this.  Given Britain's tangled history in Ireland, Northern Ireland as well as the Republic of Ireland, that is essential.  We would not have got the Good Friday Agreement, the work of John Major beforehand and that of others without that honest broker role, so we need to return to that.  That means in the current situation some care and attention should be given by nationalists and republicans on both sides of the Border to how they resolve, form relationships and behave in this situation.  It is quite serious.<\/p> <p>  I will offer one example.  President Mary McAleese's husband played an important role under the radar in building relationships with loyalists.  That gave a sense of comfort to loyalist opinion.  Such opinion is not always or often not represented at all by unionist politicians that claim to represent loyalist opinion.  Many loyalists do not believe that is occurring.  Therefore, I would urge direct relationships between the Oireachtas and those in government in Dublin with the loyalist community and the wider unionist community.  The more personal relationships there are and the more trust that can be built, the better.  I was the first Secretary of State to formally meet loyalist representatives in my office at Stormont.  Many of them, as one of my advisers described, were men in uniform.  That was a step that had not been taken but it gave recognition and respect to an important strand of opinion in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Richmond made a point about North-South relations.  Again, these are not happening.  The North-South bodies, of which there are many, are not meeting in the way they should be and in a way that is essential.  Whatever the suspicions on the side of the DUP, it is personal relationships and working together on tourism, the economy, energy or climate change that builds greater understanding and trust.  We have to try to get those going again.<\/p> <p>  I hope I am not speaking for too long but I wish to take this opportunity to say that I believe Brussels, especially the European Commission, is being too rigid.  I say this as an unapologetic remainer.  Our committees have ardent Brexiteers as well as remainers.<\/p><p>I accept the charge of being a remainer as a badge of honour.  Brussels, traditionally in a sense, subcontracted questions on Northern Ireland to Dublin and directly to London because, of course, we had a direct relationships through our ambassador in Brussels with that kind of hands-on relationship.  Members of the European Commission or, for that matter, members of the European Council or even the European Parliament, are sufficiently understanding of the situation in Northern Ireland.  I put most of the blame on the way in which Lord Frost and Boris Johnson have been behaving and, quite frankly, the dishonesty with which the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, behaved on the Irish Sea question where he denied a border that he had signed up to.  That created a sense of betrayal and of suspicion in the unionist and loyalist community.  There are faults in Brussels, and Dublin could be more energetic in being on the ground and in building relationships and trust, where loyalists might understand that Dublin is on its side in wanting to promote a future of peace, progress and prosperity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Lord Hain","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Hain.

I will say, however, say that Deputy Coveney, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, was before the committee and said that his interaction with businessmen and farmers, particularly of  a unionist persuasion, was just about finding solutions. They were not overly vexed as to the politics of this.  This has been played by unionist politicians because of the situation that they find themselves in.  I agree with Lord Hain in the fact that the loyalist communities have been let down and used by unionist politicians for many years and by the British State also at certain points in time.  <\/p><p>We are many years away now from Paisley and Molyneux, where &quot;Ulster Says No&quot; and being able to put those sort of numbers on the street.  We do not want to see any violence or anything like that into the future and we are far away from that.  I agree that we need more interaction and cool heads but I will put it plainly.

Sometimes that is gameplaying and sometimes it is just reassuring one's base but that has not been particularly beneficial in Ireland.  Succour has been given to the more extreme elements of loyalism and political unionism that there is some gameplay to be had around the Irish protocol whereas what every sensible person wants is a streamlining and to deal with the problems.<\/p><p>As to the benefits, as I said it here before and was hammered by certain voices within the the DUP for doing so, there are certain advantages that the North will have in respect of its situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the Single Market and the east-west connectivity.

One of the sessions of our Joint Committee on European Union Affairs was to deal with the whole question of the invoking of Article 16.  We gave the vice president, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, quite a tough time.  That action on Article 16 was a fundamental mistake, as the Chairman has just said.

As other speakers have said, that would be very beneficial not just to the economy of Northern Ireland but to the society generally.<\/p><p> I draw the subcommittee's attention to the shared island initiative.  When we spoke to Hilary Benn's committee, he was not too familiar with it.  It is an initiative launched by the new Government last year.  I ask the witnesses to examine and study that and the need for cross-Border infrastructural projects.  The Irish Government approved financing of &euro;500 million in the budget this year for cross-Border structures and institutions across a wide range of Departments.  It is a major initiative by the Government and something to which I wanted to draw the witnesses' attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#K01200","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I will speak directly to the two questions.  On the first, I will speak to a different strand of European opinion because I had the delight of spending my weekend virtually in Strasbourg at the first Conference on the Future of Europe plenary session as a delegate of the Oireachtas along with other Deputies, including Deputy Brady, who is on this committee.  I am very involved within Fine Gael and our Europe-wide political family, the European People's Party.  The mood on the general Brexit discussion as well as the specific protocol discussion, where there remains a mood - the vast majority of colleagues have moved on very distinctly and many colleagues never really had the level of interest that certainly we in Ireland did - is one of serious frustration and misunderstanding among those who remain with a watching brief.  It is not a misunderstanding of the mood in Northern Ireland.  I think everyone with half a wit can appreciate that unionists are very concerned and indeed have a right to be so, and the mood is very worrying for many of them in their communities.  There is, however, a lack of understanding of what is going on in the British Government.  It is not helped by repeated articles, as was mentioned, or repeated comments by certain ministers doing down a treaty they themselves negotiated and ratified merely months ago.  There just seems to be quite an ignorance of how European systems work at a political level, which is really disappointing.<\/p> <p>  I repeat that, every time there is a daft article in certain British newspapers, we do read it, we do see it and it does have an impact.  We are all very good at stressing, rightly, the importance and the desire to maintain good, cordial relations, which we are all endeavouring to do, but those things do not always help and have certainly made things very difficult.  From an Irish point of view, trying to play a very proactive role within the European Union, possibly looking for flexibility within the protocol or just reaffirming that this can last, it is very hard to be the UK's best friend within the European Union if at the same time British Government Ministers are going out to trash the agreement or trash the European Union itself.<\/p> <p>  To go to the point about Article 16, that was all very clear at the time and, as the Chair and others rightly said, those officials in the European Commission who deliberated on this for a couple of hours certainly would never do it again.  The number of times that has been rolled out as the reason to justify unilateral actions and to seek to break international law is pretty tiring at this stage.  Hearing certain voices, political and otherwise, constantly harping back to that without ever acknowledging some of the really lousy things that have been said and done in the other direction gets tough to take, and the currency of that has been well and truly spent.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the second question and in response to Baroness O'Loan, the opportunities are vast and they are fundamentally economic opportunities for Northern Ireland to look to diversify.  Many people understandably made good play of the importance of the GB export market to NI, but there is now huge opportunity in diversifying the export market with the Continent, just like we are doing in Ireland, and looking to see where that level of joined-up thinking and co-operation can be done on an all-island basis.  One of the key aims going into the Brexit process was the maintenance of the all-island economy.  It really does not matter what your political persuasion is or whether you are in business or whether you are a consumer as long as you can see your economy grow and your society improve as a result of that.  Baroness Ritchie mentioned some of the opportunities Dale Farm has had, but we also saw a whole range of other sectors talking about the opportunities: the tech sector, financial services and many in the agrifood sector.<\/p> <p>  To supplement the points Deputy Haughey made about the shared island unit, that is a huge untapped resource.  We are talking in this jurisdiction about a higher education strategy for the north west, but that does not include our third level institutions in the city of Derry.  How do we have joined-up thinking about the entire island and the entire region?  We are a relatively small island, and the more we work together and the more we use the protocol, the more opportunities there will be for many people to come.  It can be an exciting time if a lot of the political sensitivities can be worked out about the potential, particularly in Northern Ireland.  For someone sitting in an office in Dublin, when Northern Ireland succeeds socially and economically, the whole island thrives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#L00500","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I wish to respond briefly to both Peter Hain's comment about a lack of understanding within the European institutions and Baroness Ritchie's direct question.  All my interaction across the political family in Europe and with the Commission has told me they have a very deep knowledge of the intricacies of Ireland, not only at an institutional level.  People like Michel Barnier, obviously, but also people like Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi have taken enormous trouble to understand the nuances and difficulties.  I have had discussions and dinner with Mr. &Scaron;efovi.  He has a degree of understanding that is surprising.  It is the same with people such as Johannes Hahn and other Commission members who have had a long-time understanding of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will make two points in this regard.  I strongly agree with Deputy Richmond's analysis.  I spoke to many British parliamentarians in the early stages of Brexit who had a view that the economic issues would come to a point where the German Chancellor or the French President would pick up a phone and instruct Michel Barnier, \"Fix this because it is in the interests of the German car industry or French industry.\"  They had a fundamental misunderstanding that the European project is the project that underscores the heart of French and especially German politics.  The solidarity Ireland has got from the 27 is a manifestation of that because there was a view that maybe the European Union itself was somehow fragile.  I think the solidarity shown to Ireland across the 27 was to make it manifest that the European project is to be sustained and supported.  However, there is now a view, in my judgment, that the European Union wants to look beyond Brexit.<\/p><p>That is a chapter it is closing and it wants to look at the future of Europe debate, where its energy and focus has gone.  That has also become an issue for us, that as we march on, it is looking in the rear-view mirror and asking why are these things still causing aggravation.  <\/p><p> The other fundamental issue is that the EU is a community of law.  When you do deals, write down treaties and sign up to them, there is a real expectation that they are delivered upon and not walked away from.  It is very difficult if you formally agree to an agreement and then come back to say, \"Actually, let us have a different agreement and we will ignore the one we just concluded.\"  These are fundamental issues that I am not sure if everyone in the British system had a clear understanding of.  Obviously the people in this discussion have.<\/p><p> I thought Baroness Ritchie's question was on opportunities for the Republic of Ireland as opposed to Northern Ireland.

That is why it was a shock to a lot of unionists and loyalists when suddenly they found themselves facing complex arrangements for Irish Sea trade.  I wonder whether colleagues in Dublin feel that greater flexibility on the dates might be a good thing.  We have had statements to that effect - encouraging ones.  It is not to allow London to escape it obligations under the protocol, which are clear and to which they have signed up, but to allow a bit of room to sort some of these problems out.  To be frank, if we got the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement, sorting out the protocol is relatively minor by comparison.  I do not mean that in any kind of triumphalist sense having been involved in the latter one, but those were \"it will never happen\" moments.  Any good negotiation, I am sure, should be able to sort these problems out within the protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Lord Hain"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Apologies, but I must leave at 11.30 for another meeting.

I agree with much of what Lord Hain has said about some of the issues and hurdles that were overcome in 1998, 2007, 2014 and 2015 being such that, by comparison, the protocol should be easier - I will not say relatively easy - than some of those issues.  It is five years ago today that we had the referendum.  Shortly after that, the Northern Ireland Executive, Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness, sent a joint letter to the then UK Government setting out the specific concerns for Northern Ireland.  A few months later the Executive fell.  Throughout that crucial period of Britain negotiating, or starting to negotiate, its exit from the EU, there was no direct Northern Ireland voice.  Northern Ireland tended to be represented on Cabinet subcommittees by civil servants, not by politicians.  I think that was an absolute tragedy for Northern Ireland, that it was not directly involved during that period.  Fast forward to today and we see elements of political stability.  The DUP is going through a fairly tumultuous time.  There has been talk on both sides of crashing the institutions and so on.<\/p> <p>  My plea, which slightly follows one of Lord Hain's earlier comments, is that bearing in mind the experience we had without an Executive between 2017 and 2020, we all must do whatever we can to bring whatever influence we have to bear through our direct relationships with people involved in Northern Ireland to ensure the institutions survive and we do not go through that period of instability and collapse again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021062300002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Lord Caine"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I must also leave at 11.30 a.m.  I thank everyone for this morning.

Baroness Goudie said the same.  It would be timely in the aftermath of the subcommittee publishing its report.  We could do that.  I agree with Lord Jay that today's meeting was one of intent.  It was constructive but it was also heartening.  Lord Hain emphasised trust, Baroness O'Loan emphasised respect, and Baroness Ritchie spoke about dialling down the rhetoric, which is a sophisticated way of saying \"calm down\".  From our own personal journeys in life, we all know what the limitations of telling people to calm down are.  Baroness Goudie emphasised the potential of a mediator while Lord Hain spoke about honest brokers.  I will not open up the debate about where that goes but memories of George Mitchell come to mind in respect of that.  With respect to formal and informal, Baroness Ritchie gave us a semi-formal invite to Downpatrick.  We always talk in terms of London and Dublin.  Perhaps it would be nice to have something formal in Downpatrick and we could do something informal the next day in Donegal across the Border to reach out.  It would be an opportunity for both committees to meet up in Northern Ireland.  I will leave the witnesses with an old Irish saying, \"M&aacute; theasta&iacute;onn uait aithne a chur orainn, mair in&aacute;r dteannta\", which means if you want to get to know us, live with us.<\/p> <p>  What I am taking from this meeting is that the reason people were not meeting was not all down to Covid.  Over the past ten years, what we could call a vacuum has been created.  We must get back to basics.  I remember joining 12 of my colleagues in Stormont.  We met Peter Robinson and the late Martin McGuinness.  Peter Robinson started his speech by saying it was about building relationships.  He then stopped and said, \"No, delete that.  The relationships are already there.  It's what we do with these relationships that is important.\"  Perhaps we need to look at the language we use.  As a Donegal man who lives in Ulster, one thing I know about Ulster is that when you tell somebody what to do, it does not really work out.  It has not worked out and never will work out so perhaps we need to ask the questions differently and ask what we can do to help out.

They have such great experience, knowledge and insight and we could do good work collectively.<\/p> <p>  Once again, I thank our witnesses and members of our committee.

I am joined by my colleagues Patrick Farrell, our retail banking director, and Kevin Hewston, interim chief operations officer.  This is my first appearance before the committee since being appointed chief executive of the bank in June of last year.<\/p> <p>  Firstly, I assure the committee that I will always listen to the committee members and give them whatever assistance I can, and that I want Permanent TSB to bring vigorous competition, better service, better products and better value to Irish customers and small businesses in communities across Ireland.  I want to build a sustainable bank for the future and at the centre of any sustainable business is the responsibility it has to its customers.<\/p> <p>  As soon as I took up my position I set out a new purpose for Permanent TSB.  This is centred on building trust with our customers and connecting with the bank&rsquo;s community heritage, which has evolved over the past 200 years from our unique roots in communities throughout Ireland as the former Irish Permanent Building Society and the former First Trustee Savings Banks.  I set out this purpose because I want Permanent TSB to be known for having a strong sense of social purpose and one that plays a broader role in Irish society.  I strongly believe that maximising the return for customers leads to maximising the return for shareholders over the long term.  At the heart of growing a truly sustainable business is the fair treatment of and good returns for customers, acknowledging the requirement for any bank to make a return on capital so as to be financially sustainable.<\/p> <p>  While we still have more work to do to further build trust with customers, and I acknowledge there are legacy issues from the past, we are taking steps in the right direction and over the last year we have put our purpose into action with a number of measures.  We have kept all 76 of our branches open throughout the pandemic and committed to maintaining our existing branch network.  In addition to the &euro;30 million investment over the last five years, we have committed to investing a further &euro;5 million over the coming year in refurbishing and maintaining branches to make sure they remain an attractive place for our customers to do business.  We made significant cuts to our mortgage interest rates, both for new and existing customers, with greater fairness in our mortgage pricing and a shift towards offering the same rates to both new and existing customers.  We have supported our customers who were affected by the pandemic with more than 13,000 payment breaks to give these customers valuable breathing space at a time of significant upheaval.  We continue to work closely with some 1,000 customers who require ongoing support.  We supported the provision of affordable and social housing with a partnership between the bank and the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, in which the bank provides financial and operational support to the &Oacute; Cualann group.  We achieved the Business Working Responsibly Mark, which is the leading standard for corporate social responsibility and sustainability certification in Ireland.  We have also announced plans to hire more than 180 new staff with a particular focus on IT skills, to complement a &euro;150 million investment in our IT systems and digital banking capabilities.  We have announced a major initiative to grow our presence in the SME lending market, which included teaming up with the State&rsquo;s Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, to provide more than &euro;50 million in new low-cost lending to small businesses.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the single biggest example of our commitment to making things better for customers, our communities and the wider economy is our announcement in February that we are in discussions with the NatWest Group to acquire certain elements of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s retail and SME banking business.  This shows our ambition to become Ireland&rsquo;s best personal and small business bank, a bank with deep roots in Irish communities that can bring even greater competition to customers at a time when customers need competition more than ever.  If we are successful in agreeing commercial terms, Permanent TSB will be a bank with more customers, a larger footprint, greater reach and a greater ability to bring new and better products and services to retail and SME customers.<\/p> <p>  Before I conclude my opening remarks I must offer the committee an apology with regard to the level of detail I can go into at this stage about our discussions with the NatWest Group.  I hope members will appreciate that both sides have agreed to conduct these negotiations in the strictest of confidentiality and I must also respect our disclosure obligations as a company that is quoted on the Dublin and London stock exchanges.  I can say that I have been greatly encouraged at how constructively both sides are approaching these discussions.  It is my aim that we will reach an agreement that will benefit customers and create value for the State through its shareholding in the bank.<\/p> <p>  I reaffirm our commitment to continuing to support customers as we exit the Covid-19 pandemic and in demonstrating our purpose of building trust with customers.

The Senator is correct that 44 of our branches are moving to automated cash services but I will explain what that allows us to do.  Our focus in those branches is to ensure we can stop doing the administrative tasks behind the counter and get our staff out front of house so when one comes into our branches one is met by a person.  We acknowledge consumer behaviour has changed drastically, particularly in the last 15 months, towards more mobile and online banking.  Our customers also really want to meet a person and the core of our bank at a community level has always been about people.  We are still able to do 98% of the in-branch transactions that a person could have done when there was a cash desk but by using state-of-the-art automated machines we are able to get our staff out front of house to engage with our customers to help and assist them.<\/p><p>We also have a 100-strong external workforce in the community.

He described it as an administrative task.  People using cash desks meet members of staff.  Whether people are standing in the foyer or behind a desk, customers are meeting a person.

We are building up our direct bank with a phone and mobile banking service.  I am talking about people on the ground.  Prior to Covid, we had moved to getting our people out into the community.  As I mentioned, we have a 100-strong workforce that can deal with customers, which involves current and deposit accounts, mortgages, consumer finance, etc.  Covid has put paid to people visiting homes and businesses before now, but now that we are coming out of the pandemic it is about mobilising that workforce again to get back into the community.

Therefore, any speculation on requiring support from shareholders includes all shareholders, not just our 75% of shareholders.

Also, banking business models in Europe are somewhat under threat because of negative interest rates and excess liquidity.  That is the case in Ireland more so than other European countries.  Credit formation has been low in recent years arising from the crisis and the difficulties that gave.  Also, saving rates have increased significantly.  Savings among Irish households are up &euro;30 billion in the last three years, with over &euro;15 billion of that in the last year alone.  There is an excess of liquidity over lending.  That excess liquidity attracts a negative rate and is having an impact on the profitability of banks and the return we make as organisations.<\/p> <p>  To come back to the core point, if I take Irish share prices in their own right, they were much impacted by Covid and the uncertainty of Brexit.  We saw that once there was some positive news on Brexit, together with a lifting of Covid restrictions or at least a visibility of that, Irish share prices have recently increased.  Our share price has gone up significantly but I would also suggest that it is based on speculation around our previous discussion relating to the Ulster Bank franchise.  In more recent weeks, the share prices have come down slightly but they are at a higher level versus where they were in recent years.  I would suggest that there is an anticipated increase in commercial activity among wider society post pandemic.  I appreciate that there is an element of society that may not benefit from that but generally there is an anticipation of extra spending.

The market shares of the two main banks have been staying stable, or falling in some cases, in recent years.

Therefore, it is quite a competitive market and there is a lot of information for customers.  We must compete like everybody else in that respect.  Naturally, there has been some comment, particularly arising from the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, report in February, regarding the level of capital required by banks to support mortgage lending.  It highlights the competitive nature of how interest rates and costs are driven in respect of banks making a return.  I believe there will be more debate on this aspect in due course.  However, the retail area of banking is very competitive, no company has it its own way and market shares in recent years show that it is not a one-way bet.  It is necessary to work hard for every mortgage and work with all customers in a proactive way to get them from application to draw down and, ultimately, to get them keys to their own homes.

It can mean low interest rates.  It can mean forbearance in terms of mortgages.  The core issue here is what was expected by my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, and I when we wrote to the banks, and by the MICA Action Group at the time.  We were looking for PTSB and other banks to support the redress scheme by contributing to it, but they refused to do so.  Does Mr. Crowley foresee a scenario whereby there would be a contribution from the bank as a result of the mica redress scheme?<\/p> <p>  Can Mr. Crowley explain how a loan for a mica affected property is classified on the books of PTSB?  Let us be clear on this.  We have seen that one third of homes that applied for the scheme in Donegal need to be demolished, therefore, their asset value is zero.  Some of those assets are secured by PTSB loans.  How are those loans classified on the books of PTSB?<\/p><p>Has the fact that the assets are now valueless triggered an impairment review?  How is PTSB dealing with those assets and what are its obligations with regard to reporting?  There are clear obligations for impairment of loans.

It severely disabled a number of systems and necessitated the complete shutdown of the HSE's network.  We have been working to recover systems ever since.  The HSE response contains four stages.  First, the containment phase, which is now completed.  Second, the inform phase, which is also complete, but the task is ongoing.  Daily and weekly briefings are being provided to multiple stakeholders.  Third, the assess phase, which involves the restoration of services and eradication of ransomware from the network.  That phase is continuing.  Finally, the remedy phase, which involves strengthening our network against future cyber threats.  That phase is continuing.<\/p> <p>  The restoration process and the accompanying due diligence exercise is necessarily taking some time.  Although we can effectively decrypt data, that is only one element of it.  The malware must also be eradicated.  Decryption takes much longer than the original encryption, and eradication involves additional tasks to ensure that the perpetrators have no access route back into our systems.  We have worked with specialist cybersecurity firms and our application vendors to develop solutions to improve the efficiency of the decryption and eradication process, and it is showing dividends.  So far, 75% of our server estate has been decrypted and 70% of our end-user devices are now available.<\/p> <p>  While the architecture of our network dictates a certain initial sequence to the restoration of services, the majority of our sequencing decisions are clinically informed.  We are focusing our efforts on restoring the systems most critical to patient care in the first instance.  From a technical standpoint, many systems are now operational again, but restoring interoperability between systems and sites is ongoing.  That continues to impact on service delivery.  Characteristically, our staff across the country have worked extremely hard to keep services going in the face of the enormous challenges presented by the cyberattack and ensuing shutdown.  They are doing this at a time when our health system is experiencing very high demand for services.  I want to particularly thank staff for their hard work and commitment to the delivery of services to the public at this time.  Our IT staff, supported by the Defence Forces and contracted IT experts, have maintained a relentless schedule.  This continues seven days a week.<\/p> <p>  There is no underestimating the damage that this cyberattack has caused.  There are financial costs, certainly, but there will, unfortunately, also be human costs.  I assure members and the public that we are doing everything possible to restore the systems.  I must also caution that it will likely take months before systems are fully restored.  Accordingly, I must ask the public for continued forbearance and understanding.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to say that the Covid-19 vaccination programme is making really good progress.  We administered 340,000 vaccinations last week and GPs have administered close to 1.5 million vaccines.  Our other vaccination channels, namely, community-based vaccination teams, acute hospitals, ambulance and community pharmacies, are also functioning very effectively indeed.<\/p> <p>  We have 39 vaccination centres in place.  Over 3.7 million vaccines have been administered.  Over 2.3 million people have now received a first dose, or single dose, of the vaccine and over 1.3 million have received a second dose, or single dose.<\/p><p>Our key objective in prioritising vaccine cohorts is to protect the most vulnerable.  It is apparent, given the major drop in hospitalisations and mortality, that we are achieving this.<\/p><p> It is probably accepted by everyone that the health and well-being of mothers and babies has been at the heart of maternity visit restrictions, which I accept are a significant burden.  Hospitals must apply infection prevention and control measures in a manner appropriate to the physical infrastructure that they have.  We have provided guidance on partner access as I will outline.  Maternity services should facilitate a minimum of a 30 minute visit daily.  The partner should be facilitated during labour while the woman is in the labour ward.  It may not be possible to facilitate women in multi-occupancy antenatal wards before they go to the labour ward.  Partners should be facilitated at the anomaly scan and any other visit that may involve communications of emotional significance.  Parents should be facilitated in the national neonatal intensive care unit, NICU.  Given the improved Covid-19 situation, we recently asked all maternity hospitals and units to review their approach again.  This week, the national women and infants health programme is meeting with the clinical leads of the six maternity networks.  Subject to infrastructure limitations, I am confident that the least restrictive approach possible will be adopted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Good morning.

Regarding the cyberattack and cost, there are a few aspects for now and the future, as the Senator said.  We will incur a number of costs in the short and medium term.  As the Senator described, much technical work will have to be carried out on the network and infrastructure.  There are capital costs to replace a number of devices across our networks which we believe it would not be best practice to leave on the network with the new controls that we will put in place.  There are also capital costs where we will need to and will take the opportunity to upgrade some of our key systems, such as national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS, our radiology system, to bring them up to a higher standard.  Third party costs, as the Senator mentioned, relate to technical expertise that we have engaged including some of the best technical experts from a range of specialist providers that we have engaged in the country.  As the Senator rightly said, we have also engaged international expertise, primarily the international organisation in the USA, Mandiant, which is working on the decryption process.  It is a world leader in malware and ransomware recovery.  It has been working with us since the cyberattack.  There are costs across a range of providers.<\/p> <p>  We will have to incur costs in the future, considering the scale and size of our networks.  I worked on networks previously in different organisations.  Many organisations have a 24-hour monitoring centre, sometimes called a service operation centre or network operation centre.  Due to the scale of the network, we will need to put in place a security operation centre to monitor our network much more comprehensively for 24 hours.  We will take the opportunity to update many of our Microsoft applications to Microsoft 365 and a significant cost will be associated with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Reid estimate the costs to be approximately &euro;500 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#C00400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>The immediate costs are well over &euro;100 million, including capital and revenue costs, just to get through this.

In the short to medium term, it will cost significantly over &euro;100 million to get through this process and we are working on the medium and longer-term impacts.  It is clear, if one looks back at the previous three years, that we invested approximately &euro;82 million in malware and security protection, and a number of associated actions.

There will be two more weeks of more than 300,000.  In July, based on the national immunisation advisory committee's, NIAC, recommendations on what vaccines we can utilise with which age cohorts, we are down to just Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines, unless and until there is a change regarding the use of Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines.

A number of years ago the emergency department task force was established.  The INMO is represented on that task force.  I understand Mr. Reid also sits on that task force.  My understanding is that it has not met since January 2020.  Given the serious overcrowding being experienced in our emergency departments again, why has it been so long since the task force met?

While attendances have gone up, the admission rate has not changed hugely in many sites.  Prior to the cyberattack, the patient flow was much improved.  We had seen an increase, but because of the some of the capacity the Deputy referenced earlier in terms of our hospital avoidance measures and egress options, we have seen the lowest ever rate of delayed discharges.  There are number of things that were working very well that have been impacted by the cyberattack.  We are seeing longer lengths of stay in hospitals and greater numbers of attendances.

If there is a particular problem in some hospitals, whatever the reason, it would be useful if the task force were to meet.<\/p> <p>  I have two more questions for Mr. Reid.  The first is in regard to student nurses and midwives in placements.  There was a commitment to pay them &euro;100 and that was to be backdated.  My understanding, having engaged with the INMO, is that not all students have been paid.  I do not know if that is down to the cyberattack or if there is some other reason for it.  Whatever the reason, voluntary hospitals appear to be more on top of making the payments than is the case with acute hospitals run by the HSE.<\/p><p>I ask Mr. Reid to respond to that.<\/p><p> Mr. Reid gave figures earlier for the vaccine roll-out.  We all welcome that more people are getting vaccinated, which is really good news.  The harm associated with Covid is significantly reducing because of the vaccine roll-out, which is something we should all celebrate.  Mr. Reid spoke about the supply of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines over the coming months.  I ask him to give us the figures for the Janssen vaccine.  The last time Mr. Reid appeared before the committee, the Minister had said that the worst-case scenario for June was about 60,000 doses of the Janssen vaccine, with the best-case scenario being 230,000.  My understanding is we might have got about 70,000.  We were expecting very significant amounts of the Janssen vaccine in July.  Again, my understanding is that will be at the lower end of the expectation.  We know the Janssen vaccine is also being made available to pharmacists.

How many hospitals are not complying with this?  The Minister is getting all the flak for this.  Much of the content of the emails is directed personally at him.

I will make a brief comment on his opening comments about vaccines.  We certainly are in a much stronger position than we could have expected in terms of the benefits we are seeing from the vaccination programme, both in reduced hospitalisations and visits to ICU.  As of last night, we had 39 hospitalisations, of whom 13 were in ICU.  Contrast that with the dark days of January when there were 2,020 in hospital and 212 people in ICU.  We are seeing the benefits, including in the public mood.<\/p> <p>  Our experience and that of the public is that every time we think we are ahead of the virus, whether that was last summer or Christmas, it has a tendency to bite back.  The immediate concern is the Delta variant.  We are seeing in the percentage rise in cases, not just in Ireland but in European countries and cities, a very prevalent surge in the Delta variant.  There is no reason to expect that Ireland will be any different or that we will not see a surge in Delta variant cases.  That is a trend we are beginning to see and it is a concern.  Notwithstanding that, we are in a much stronger position than we might have expected.<\/p> <p>  On vaccines for the 60 to 69 years cohort, we take all of our administration of vaccines guidance from the national immunisation advisory committee.  It gives guidance to the CMO who makes recommendations to the Government and we comply with all of that.  In fairness to NIAC, it takes the best world evidence and monitors that carefully daily and weekly.  It continues to do that.  The guidance and advice at that stage was that AstraZenica was suitable to be administered to people above the ages of 50.  The risks that were prevalent at that stage were to population ages below that.  That was the process then.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the timeframe, it had been, if the Deputy recalls, the administration of a second dose was moved from 12 weeks to 16 weeks.  That interval has now moved back to eight weeks.  We have a programme in place whereby last week alone, almost 100,000 people were given their second dose of AstraZenica.  This applies to about 450,000 people in total.  The process will be accelerated and instead of a nine-week programme, it will be a five-week programme.  Everybody in all the age groups that received AstraZenica should have received the second dose by the week commencing 19 July.  That accelerates the process and we will increasingly see people in the 60 to 69 years cohort.

The HSE has two key messages.  The first is that we want to monitor things closely because we cannot let what happened in January happen again, where hospitalisations reached over 2,000 and when more than 200 people were in our ICUs.  This had an impact on an already exhausted healthcare staff.  That is what we in the HSE will be watching.  NPHET will provide advice with regard to opening up and the Government will make the ultimate decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>My final question relates to maternity visits.

I have questions on three areas, namely, third level students, children with cancer, and maternity restrictions, which I am sure the witnesses will receive further questions on after I conclude.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the vaccination of third level students in August and September.  I have been contacted by a number of students who are going abroad either on the Erasmus programme or for international studies.  Some of the institutions they are going to have said that the students cannot attend unless they can prove they have been vaccinated, otherwise they will not be able to attend on-campus.  Are there plans for those students?  It is not an enormous cohort but there will be a number of students who, having paid and are ready, will not be able to go abroad or will have to delay going because they will not be vaccinated in time.  Has any thought been given to that situation?<\/p> <p>  I have a second question for Mr. McCallion in relation to children with cancer.  Children with cancer and their parents are still waiting to hear when vaccines will be made available to children aged 12 to 15.  I know the Pfizer vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, but there has been no word yet from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, on this.  We are waiting on NIAC to give the go ahead.  Has the HSE given any consideration on how it will prioritise these high-risk patients in that age group, because they have been isolating for a long time and, obviously, the parents are extremely concerned about their children.  I will throw all my questions out and the witnesses can do as they will with them.<\/p> <p>  On the maternity restrictions, why are the risk assessments not publicly accessible despite the calls from Dr. Peter McKenna in April, and the HSE in May, to make them public?  Is there any further information as to why these risk assessments are not available?  On 10 May, Dr. Tony Holohan said that there should be a return to pre-pandemic partner access.  There still seems to be mixed messages on when that will happen.  Do the witnesses know when that is going to happen, whether it will be in the coming months or weeks?<\/p> <p>  The vaccination levels among maternity unit staff, and pregnant people and partners will affect restrictions.  Obviously, vaccination levels are extremely high among maternity staff and levels are climbing among pregnant people and their partners.  What is the current position of the HSE on the risk associated with partner attendance in maternity units, where other public health guidelines, such as social distancing and the wearing of personal protective equipment, are taken into account?  There was reference made in the guidelines that partners could not be allowed in for privacy reasons, I am sure the witnesses are aware of this.  That was never a reason in pre-pandemic times.  Therefore, why has privacy suddenly started to be referred to as a reason that pregnant peoples' partners need to be kept away from certain things, when that was not the case before the pandemic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#H00700","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I will make a few comments and they pass to my colleagues, Mr. McCallion and Dr. Henry.  On the first issue of third level students and their vaccination, it is worth reminding members of the committee and ourselves that the whole approach, in terms of the vaccination programme, has been to vaccinate those who are most vulnerable first, and it is working.  We started to programme based on NIAC advice, which was starting with residents and staff in long-term care facilities, moving on to healthcare workers, then people over the higher age groups and, indeed, medically vulnerable groups.  We should remain confident that this was the correct approach, that is what is working for Ireland and working for our vaccination programme.  There have been many calls throughout the programme to date, at the very early stages, the middle stages and now, to look to different groups at different stages.  We take our absolute advice, guidance and direction from NIAC and through the Chief Medical Officer and Government policy.  I reiterate that is has worked, it is working, and we should continue with it based on the process of working through the age groups.  It is based on limited supply and if we had a full supply, we would love to vaccinate all age cohorts together, but we must stick with what is working, and that is my very strong message to the committee.  I will pass to my colleague, Dr. Henry, on the visits question, and then to Mr. McCallion, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>We want to restore to the pre-pandemic levels but, as I said earlier, we are mindful of the particular risks in pregnancy and the evolving data, including that from the UK obstetric surveillance system, in March 2021, which looked at stillbirth rates.

We are in the happy position where we can release those incrementally.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hoey referred to the privacy issue.  Generally speaking, when women were in labour pre-pandemic, they had partners with them on the labour ward, but it was not always the case for a woman who may have been in suspect early-labour and was returned to a multi-occupancy antenatal ward, to have their partners in there, to give respect to other patients on the ward.  There is some degree of misunderstanding of what prevailed before the pandemic began.  As I said earlier, in response to one of the Senator's colleagues' question, we are now moving beyond those four areas.

We look at all of those factors before we come up with a plan.  We are doing that planning through our planning team and national immunisation office, in parallel with the work going with NIAC on looking at the evidence and so on in terms of vaccinating, so that if a recommendation comes from NIAC, we have assessed the options and looked at the best way to do it.

I mentioned to Deputy Crowe's colleagues earlier that the most recent review this week is expanding beyond those four areas which are listed in the opening statement to additional areas.<\/p> <p>  We issued guidance.  We contacted all the hospitals.  There is, as has been mentioned, some variation based on infrastructure, which is understandable.  Some of these maternity units are quite old, with infrastructure which corresponds to another age when it comes to ideal infection prevention control measures.  Our principal aim is to keep women, babies and pregnancies safe.

I will not repeat them again because I have stated them to the Deputy's colleagues.

In most cases, but not all, the person is good health, and that needs to be stressed.<\/p> <p>  There are situations in which a maternity hospital is co-located with a medical hospital and there are complexities with that.

Is it possible for those 16 units to set that out in writing individually rather than it coming as a general statement from the HSE or Mr. Reid?<\/p><p>Can they be asked to set out the procedures in writing?  I am getting feedback from different units around the country that different sets of rules are being applied compared with what we are being told publicly.  I spoke to a medical person in recent days who had seen four patients where their respective partners are already vaccinated so there should not be any reason they could not be admitted.  Can that issue be clarified?  Can the 16 units which are following the overall guidelines issue a statement to that effect individually?<\/p><p> The cyberattack has resulted in a huge build-up of waiting lists for surgery and for many procedures.  Is it possible to expand the treatment purchase fund to deal with the backlog?  For instance, yesterday I heard of someone being advised to go to Northern Ireland for a hip operation although the same facilities are available in a private hospital in Cork within 30 miles of where they live.  It may not be available in a public hospital because of the priorities that they are giving.  What is being proposed to deal with that waiting list and trying to reduce the numbers waiting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#J01300","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I will make a brief comment on maternity first.  I will restate that we fully understand the stress that maternity visit restrictions has had on women and their partners and families.  We are doing everything possible to be as compassionate as we can while protecting young women and their babies as well.  That is the key driver for us and for all our clinical and medical teams across the country.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Henry will answer on specifics but we get returns from the 19 individual maternity hospitals on the implementation of the guidance document that Dr. Henry sent out nationally.  In fairness, I mentioned earlier that 16 of the 19 were fully compliant last Thursday.  The three that were not put in measures to be fully compliant for this week.  When I say a hospital is not compliant, it is not that those concerned are mischievously going out to be non-compliant.  They have certain conditions in their hospital where they find it difficult to find the risk balance between access and visits and infection prevention and control.  That is the rationale and the reason this happens.  <\/p> <p>  As for the waiting lists for surgery, with every wave we have, our waiting lists for people for various forms of surgery and elective care are affected.  The national service plan for this year has two funds, namely, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, of &euro;125 million and the access to care fund, which is about &euro;210 million.  We are working collaboratively with our colleagues in the Department of Health and with the Minister about an approach for the best use of those funds to address some of the waiting lists.  To be frank, it has been significantly impactful for us, particularly with the recent cyberattack.  It will involve a combination of using private capacity, using the NTPF, strengthening further capacity through the recruitment of consultants and other teams in our public hospitals and new ways of working that my colleague Ms Anne O'Connor has implemented during Covid, which involve many outpatient departments getting waiting lists in a very different way.  That will be the overall strategy we will agree with the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The Deputy was asking if the hospitals make their own statements.

I compliment the staff members of the HSE on their work during the pandemic, particularly on the success of the vaccination programme which was always dependent on supply, as has been proven with the increased delivery of vaccines and the increase in patients who have been seen.<\/p> <p>  I am also going to touch on maternity services.  As others have said, we have been inundated with testimonies, which were sometimes heartbreaking, from expectant mothers, mothers who gave birth last year and some who have suffered heartbreaking situations where news around scans and anomalies was delivered in a very cold fashion because of Covid.  I will briefly read some testimony.  A lady called Stacey contacted me to say that partners are not visitors, fathers are not visitors and that she needs her husband to be there during labour and the post-natal period.  She asked that these restrictions be lifted, as this uncertainty is crippling.  Another lady, who lost a baby to stillbirth, wrote that not one more woman should ever have to walk the road she had walked alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00700","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I must interrupt Senator Kyne; he cannot really name people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00800","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>This woman went on to give a two-page testimony of giving birth, stillbirth, and all that went with it.  It was heartbreaking.  Another lady wrote how women and their partners are looking for a return to pre-pandemic levels of access through the pregnancy journey.  She queried the distinction between full labour and active labour and stated that women in labour need support and advocacy whether they are 1 cm, 4 cm or 10 cm dilated.  This is the whole point.  I have spoken to officials in Galway on this point of how you define labour.  Once a woman goes into a maternity hospital and presents to give birth, her partner should be there with them at all stages, as well as for 12-week and 20-week scans in particular.  They do not know what news they are going to get.  Where they get difficult news, they need to have their partner present, no ifs or buts.<\/p><p> I know that at times doctors can become immune to problems because they see so many of them, and I understand that, but women and their partners need to be together for these heartbreaking situations they have to go through where they receive bad news - and even where they do not receive bad news and the woman is just delivery a baby.  Even the normal, successful delivery of a child is an emotional roller coaster for women and their partners, and the latter need to be present.  We need to see that in place in all our maternity hospitals - no exceptions, no ifs and no buts.  Whatever has to be done to ensure that this happens needs to be done.  That is not a question; those are just comments based on testimony.  There has been enough uncertainty.  We have seen the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  As I said, the women need to have their partners present and need the support and love of a partner, whatever about good news, certainly in the case of bad news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00900","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I will go through the Senator's points.  I absolutely agree with him.  Our staff in the 19 maternity units want to be able to go back to a situation whereby partners can be full partners in every sense of the word during the whole process of childbirth, which, as the Senator says, is a difficult and anxious time.  It is mostly a happy time but sometimes, of course, as the Senator outlined, there are difficulties and bad news.  That is precisely why we are looking at this latest visitor guidance this week.  We are amending it to look at exactly those areas where there may be difficult news and particular anxiety, that is, those early pregnancy assessment units, people with high-risk pregnancies and people presenting in emergency situations in later pregnancy.  I mentioned earlier that nobody wanted to put in these restrictions but we were faced with overwhelming Covid disease and threat in January.  It threatened to destabilise our hospital system and, in fact, it did destabilise it.  There were multiple outbreaks in various settings.  Fifteen of those 19 units are co-located with general hospitals.  Those measures were put in place, as were the general visiting restriction measures, which also caused great distress to relatives and sick people in general hospitals and in nursing homes.  The measures were put in place in order to try to protect people as much as possible from the worst effects of this virus.  It is exactly those areas the Senator outlines that we are trying to focus on now as we return to some kind of normality.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned labour.  The practice has been, and the advice is very clear, that partners should be present in labour wards.  Sometimes women go back to antenatal wards after initial assessment.  Many of our units, which are not modern by any stretch of the imagination, are multiple occupancy wards and, as such, it was not the practice pre pandemic to have partners there constantly when other women occupy the wards.  What we are trying to standardise and to bring into practice, and what we have in those 19 units, is that a partner have every right to be present in the labour ward during labour.  What we are not able to commit to, however, based on the varying infrastructure of hospitals, is that people be present in the antenatal ward where it is a multiple occupancy ward because of the rights and privacy requirements of other women on that ward.<\/p> <p>  These are heartbreaking stories.  As I said, our staff, our working nurses and doctors, want to see pre-pandemic visiting practices return but they have had a very difficult few months themselves trying to keep women safe, to protect pregnancies and to protect women during what was certainly the worst surge of Covid-19 in January and February, during which we learned Covid is not without danger and risk to pregnancies and to women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Henry.  I accept the situation we were in post Christmas but we are in a much different situation now.  As I said, the heartbreaking testimonies we have seen over recent months cut to the core of life and death and expectant mothers' worry.  We therefore need to get back to whatever operated pre pandemic for expectant mothers.  They need to have that love and support of a partner for delivery and for scans.  Positive scans are fine, but you just do not know when you go in there what news you will get.  Again, reading the testimonies, where there is an anomaly, news may be delivered to women on their own, with no support.  They may be told to wait in a room or have to deliver news to their families in a car park.  It is unacceptable that that would be the way in which things operate in a hospital in this day and age.  I appreciate that Covid is the reason the restrictions are there, but for something as personal and as heartbreaking as this there needs to be a better system.  Cognisance needs to be taken of the delivery of the news and having partners there with the expectant mothers to provide that love and support and comfort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#L00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I will follow on from that point about the maternity hospital visits.

I suppose what many members are looking for is possibly a more imaginative approach if at all possible, even if the partner were to use PPE or something coming in for that visit, that news or whatever else.  Could we send out even that message, that we are looking at all areas, that we are listening to the stories people have to tell about their difficulties and that the approach will be as imaginative as possible?

This was notwithstanding concerns they had about infection prevention and control and their infrastructure.  It is because of that ongoing questioning and interrogation and the direct advocacy and concerns of the women and partners involved that we are pushing hospitals to do whatever they can to comply with the guidance we have given out, which, as I said, is about recovering as quickly as we can to that pre-pandemic level.  I do not mean to labour the point but, as I said, and as the Chairman echoed, we are constantly balancing the risk.  We have found that Covid-19 is a very volatile virus in its impact on the population in healthcare settings.  The vaccination programme brings great additional protection to people and certainly has allowed us much greater freedom and has opened up choice for us in respect of visiting and other hospital services.

It is very interesting.  There are a few aspects to it.  The first relates to equality of opportunities for all, which is very important.  We want to make sure Irish is a living oral language.  If we are to do that, we must promote the language to all.  A real danger arises from the absence of a foundation level course.  Students who would traditionally have done foundation level in Irish and who would have had some meaningful exposure to the language will now not have that exposure.  They will instead be in an ordinary level group and struggling to swim.  Foundation level is important.<\/p> <p>  The oral aspects of the language are crucial if we are going to promote it to everybody.  As John has referred to, the proposed change from 40% to 35% sends a very serious, symbolic and negative message.  While it depended on the school to a degree, an oral examination used to be a possible part of the junior certificate Irish examinations.  It no longer counts for any marks for junior certificate Irish, although it does count as part of a classroom-based assessment.  That does not form part of the junior certificate issued by the State.  That sends a very poor message.<\/p> <p>  The Senator quite rightly mentioned students who can access Irish language courses in the Gaeltacht.  He mentioned he was on such a course himself.  Similar language exchanges are available to study French, German and so on abroad.  In the context of equal opportunities, such courses are realistically only available to families who can pay for them.  Extensive scholarships might go some way towards levelling the playing field.  If we want Irish to be a spoken language promoted and available to all, we need to ensure a significant oral component and that a foundation level course is available so that everybody can have access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021062300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an pointe c&eacute;anna an-t&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn.

Even among the maths teaching community, the whole issue of bonus points is quite a contested space, as our ASTI colleagues have said.  There was a debate quite recently as to whether bonus points should be offered for physics and chemistry, for example.  There has also been debate as to whether priority of some form or another should be given to other subjects.  This presents a difficulty in that it can, to some extent, end up in a debate on what subjects are most important.  Such subjects may or may not be seen as so important in a few years' time.  If bonus points are brought in for any subject, should they be time-limited?  What is it sought to achieve with them and over what timeframe?  If bonus points are brought in for any given subject, how can they be taken away later?  The teachers and communities involved in other subjects will, quite understandably, say their subjects are also very important.  All of them will be correct because every subject is very important.  There is a danger of sending a message that one is, in some way, more important than others.<\/p><p>Even among the maths teaching community, the issue of bonus points has proved to be quite controversial.  There are different views on whether they have worked.<\/p><p> We mentioned the issue of equal opportunities earlier.  One of the fundamental flaws with bonus points for any subject, not specifically Irish, is that they are only good if the person is planning on going to higher education.  It does nothing whatsoever to incentivise the one third of students who do not intend to go to higher education but whose individual pathways, whether further education, an apprenticeship, joining the workforce or travelling, are equally important to them and should be equally important to the education system.  Providing bonus points creates an incentive at a point in time for some students, but the question is how to taper that incentive over time if, for whatever reason, and it is always for a very good reason, some other subject becomes a national priority.  There is an issue around that and there is also the equity issue.  It is also important to point out that almost since the foundation of the State, students who do their leaving certificate exams through Irish can avail of bonus marks in other subjects.  There is an incentive in the system already but where bonus points have, quite understandably, been brought in, they have been controversial even in those areas.  Even if we do bring them in, we will be doing nothing for the one third of students who do not intend to go to higher education immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021062300002#G02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as an gcur i l&aacute;thair.

As Mr. MacGabhann has noted, there is a programme in junior cycle around Irish heritage and culture which can be done through the Irish language.  It gives another level of interest in the whole area and practice to students whose level of Irish would already be quite good.  There has been some preliminary discussion about something similar for the leaving certificate, but I have to emphasise it is very preliminary.  Part of the reason behind that is we are all struggling with the idea of how T1 and T2 will interface in the first place, but the uptake of the course in heritage and culture at junior cycle has also been very low.  We are trying to find out how low and why that is.  The suspicion, and I need to emphasise that it is only at this stage a suspicion, is that it is an issue of resourcing, as Mr. MacGabhann and Ms Loughnane both made reference to.  We are talking about more classes, which means more teachers, so that also has to be folded into the issue.  The T1 and T2 courses will be premised on the issue of resourcing, and it will be important to provide the additional resources for them.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that on the day of the leaving certificate exam, regardless of whether a student has gone to a T1 school or a T2 school, they can ask for the other exam paper.  A student in a T2 school could opt on the day for the T1 paper or students in a T1 school who struggle with T1 could choose at some point to take the T2 course, as is their right.  We have a resourcing issue whereby we will have students in T1 schools doing T1 but we will also have students in T1 schools doing T2, which is their entitlement already.  There will be a resourcing issue coming off that.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question also raises the importance of maintaining foundation level so that all students can access the course and have exposure to the language.<\/p><p>It is a language so it is very important we maintain the priority of the oral component in the leaving certificate for the purposes of marks because, whether we like it or not, if something acquires marks as part of the leaving certificate, it gains more traction.<\/p><p> We also need to be looking back.  An initial review of junior certificate Irish is taking place at the NCCA, though it has not actually been examined yet because of Covid.  The TUI made clear from the very beginning, five or six years ago, that a key element of any initial review of junior certificate Irish has to be the fact the oral component could, depending on school level, carry marks as part of the junior certificate and no longer does.  It is important we also prioritise that as part of the initial review of junior cycle Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021062300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Cad is br&iacute; le T1 school agus T2 school?

The Chairman made reference to Irish language schools and how textbooks often come late in the day.  I need to make it clear I am not criticising anyone who produces them, but that is a reality.<\/p> <p>  There is a problem in relation to all schools, both English and Irish language, in terms of support materials for teachers for new courses and continuing professional development for new courses.  It is important this material comes out at the earliest possible stage so that people are ready when the course begins in the August-September of the following year and teachers feel confident in the new programme.  That is clearly a very serious issue in the Irish language schools, but I argue it is sometimes an issue in the English language schools and we need to cater for both.<\/p> <p>  In On the availability of subjects, there are challenges there.  There are very serious resourcing issues there.  There are almost 40 leaving certificate examination subjects, which do not include subjects where there is not an examination component, for example, SPHE, personal development, RSE, and that type of area.  I doubt that there is a single school in the country, be it Irish or English language, that can provide all 37 or 38 subjects.  The resources are simply not there to do it.  Resourcing is a very serious issue, not just for students moving schools but also across the entire spectrum.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of resources, it would be remiss of me not to mention that when it comes to percentage of GDP spent on second level education, Ireland is either the last or the second last in the entire OECD.  If education is, as I believe it is, genuinely an investment in society as well as the economy, we need to invest in it.  Saying it is satisfactory or acceptable in some way to Irish society and the Irish taxpayer that we should invest the lowest, or second lowest, in the entire OECD in our education system is quite shameful.<\/p> <p>  The third area I will come back to is that of equal opportunity.<\/p><p>It is vitally important we retain foundation level in order that all students can access the leaving certificate Irish programme.  It is vital the priority attached to the oral component of the leaving and junior certificates is genuinely valued through the issue of percentage as part of the leaving certificate.<\/p><p> On bonus points, I accept there are very strong views on this.  I accept people are debating how the T1 and T2 interface will work.  My own view is it creates a distortion in the system, but I accept there are views on the other side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021062300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Maidir leis na point&iacute; b&oacute;nais, t&aacute; an chont&uacute;irt ann nach mbeadh b&eacute;im ar aon cheo ach amh&aacute;in ar an rud sin.

Are the minutes formally agreed and there are no matters arising?  Agreed.<\/p><p>This meeting has been convened to hear from the European Commission Executive Vice-President and Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager - I hope I pronounced that well - who has responsibility for the Making Europe Fit for the Digital Age strategy.  It is my sincere honour and privilege to extend a very warm welcome to the Commissioner, who will be joining the meeting via Microsoft Teams.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite the Commissioner to make her opening statement, and questions will then be posed by members of our committee.  As the witness is already aware, the committee may publish her opening statement on its website following today&rsquo;s meeting.<\/p><p>Before I invite the Commissioner to deliver her opening statement, which will be limited to five minutes, I advise the witness of the following with regard to parliamentary privilege and I hope the Commissioner and the members will bear with me while I go through these housekeeping rules.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they may be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of the domestic law and how that may apply to the evidence they may give.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre to participate in the public meeting.  I will not permit members to attend unless they are adhering to that constitutional requirement and, therefore, any member not so present will be asked to leave the meeting.  I also ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit today of the Commissioner and of the Debates Office staff who are preparing the Official Report.  I also ask that microphones be muted when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask our guest and members to use the raise hand function on their screen if they want to contribute.  We have speaking slots and it would be wonderful if we could adhere to them.  I remind everyone as well to turn off their mobile phones, if at all possible.<\/p><p>Without further ado, we are privileged and delighted to have the Commissioner with us today.  I feel a little bit of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu <\/i>because I had the pleasure of attending the Conference on the Future of Europe in Strasbourg at the weekend.  It is wonderful to see the European flag flying in the background again today and it feels very apt after the weekend I spent in Strasbourg and in the context of the important work to be undertaken in the months ahead.  I invite the Commissioner to make her official statement to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#A00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for this very warm welcome and for the opportunity to exchange views with the committee today regarding how to make the best use of digital technologies to improve our societies and our Union.  I am glad this meeting is possible since travel is still restricted.  Our discussions, however, should not be restricted because there is an urgent need for our democracies to catch up and get ahead of the curve of technological development to serve our people in the best possible manner.<\/p> <p>  One lesson of the pandemic is that digital technologies can enable many things which otherwise would not be possible.  Equally, digital technologies can also facilitate travel and enable us to come together.  This is best exemplified by the European Union digital Covid-19 certificates, which will come into effect and be available on 1 July.  On the other hand, though, digital technologies can also increase differences.  Those who can fully benefit from an enriched and secure digital space with a full range of services are in a very different position from those who cannot benefit in the same way.  That disparity in access might derive from a lack of connectivity, skills, hardware and-or access to different services.<\/p> <p>  It is important we consider this digital divide as something we should work on, and this is why the deployment of fibre and 5G is very important.<\/p><p>I welcome the ongoing roll-out of the national broadband plan that aims to deliver high-speed broadband services to all premises in Ireland.  The expansion of the digital sector, however, should not come at the expense of a second transition, which is to being a climate-neutral continent.  It is important that data centres, for example, minimise their CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions, as they now account for many of these CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions.  While we roll out digital, we must really be much more effective in minimising CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions.<br\/><br\/>There will be no green transition without the digital transition.  They come together but only if we are successful in co-ordinating policies between the two.  Being successful in that respect also takes in the enabling of our European values to come to life with the help of digital technologies.  It is why we in the Commission have adopted our digital compass, the European way for the &quot;digital decade&quot; that sets out what we want to achieve by 2030.<br\/><br\/>Like a compass, this strategy has four cardinal points.  The first, of course, is about humans and how we can get the basic and expert skills to shape digitisation.  The second is about secure infrastructure to help us to get connected.  The third is the digital transformation of businesses and reinterpretation of business models and ideas with the use of digital technologies.  Last but not least is the digitisation of public services and egovernance, enabling public services to be delivered in a digital way.<br\/><br\/>It is not enough just to set targets and we need resources to enable us to reach those targets.  We have both the multi-annual financial framework and the NextGenerationEU recovery and resilience facility to help us to do this.  Members know a minimum of 20% of the recovery and resilience funds have the objective of achieving digital transition in a sustainable way.  The in-depth assessment of the Irish plan is ongoing, following which I hope to confirm that Ireland meets the digital targets.<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>Cybersecurity, and particularly in the Irish context, is very topical because of the hideous ransomware attack on the health system of Ireland just last month, forcing Ireland to shut down most of the healthcare IT systems.  I really want to express my solidarity with the people affected by this and firmly condemn such a malicious act.  This is aggressive interference in a very sensitive and strategic area, as health services all over the world have suffered an increase in attacks during the pandemic.  This is pathetic behaviour from the people who are responsible.<br\/><br\/>Everyone is deeply concerned about these attacks.  The more we use digital technology, the more vulnerable we can be if we do not protect ourselves in the best possible way.  This is why we have launched a revision of the network and information systems directive in order to have broader scope and bring more sectors on board.  It is also about increasing coverage of the healthcare sector, meaning many more hospitals and health-related facilities will need to take legally required cybersecurity measures and report cyber incidents.<br\/><br\/>Just today, we launched a proposal for a new joint cyber unit to improve cross-border co-operation in preventing cyberattacks and assistance so that member states can help each other if there is an attack.<br\/><br\/>I have some comments on the Digital Services and Digital Markets Acts that have been proposed, both focusing on the market or services to be delivered with more security with products sold online and in the handling of illegal content.  This also involves securing freedom of speech and, with the proposed Digital Markets Act, ensuring the market is open and competitive for the many amazing and innovative European companies with interesting products to present to us.  There is an artificial intelligence proposal focusing on the use cases and where there is a risk of fundamental values not being upheld while embracing artificial intelligence in all its many other forms.<br\/><br\/>There is a review of the broadband cost reduction directive in order to ensure we have a sustainable, quick and more efficient roll-out of high-capacity networks, including fibre and 5G.  We have much legislation in the pipeline, focusing on two fundamental elements.  We must be able to trust technology in order to see its full benefits and we must ensure our democracy is not only catching up with technology but getting ahead of the curve in order to be able to shape our future societies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Vestager for that insightful introduction to our discussion today.

The Digital Services Act will provide an obligation to do a horizontal risk assessment on the digital services to determine whether there is a risk they can be misused, for instance, to undermine elections.  We have seen examples of that.  If so, those risks must be mitigated by the service provider.<\/p> <p>  Also, in the case of individuals, if something is taken down, they should be told and have the option to complain about it.

There is a major problem here in Ireland which is mainly due to poor broadband in rural areas, but it is also a problem in socioeconomic terms.

For some kids, who have good connectivity, the correct gadgets, and whose parents can help out, the pandemic has been one thing.  However, for kids with very poor connectivity and whose parents have not been able to help out, this may have been a year that was more or less wasted.  In a child's life, a year of schooling counts for something.<\/p> <p>  There are two things from this.  Obviously, we have varying subcompetence when it comes to education, yet we have made a digital education action plan to see what we have learned in this.  The second thing is to focus on connectivity.  A minimum of 20% of the recovery and resilience facility is for digital technologies, and much of that goes to connections, in particular, where there is no business case.  If a private business does not roll out services because it does not believe there is a business case, a state can come in and make sure there is sufficient support for the roll-out to happen.  At the same time, it should work on other forms of technology so that the very remote areas can also be connected with broadband or fibre and, if not, via satellite.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Munster raised the point that of families living door to door in an urban environment, some have the resources to connect and others do not.  That is an important point for the local authorities.  In my letter box, when I came home the other day, there was an invitation to an open house youth centre, where young people were invited to come and write their CVs and learn how to deal with online job searches.

I thank her for giving us her time.  I want to talk about the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act because they are, as Deputy Munster just said, related to legislation we are considering here.  I will specifically talk about some of the issues we need to address domestically and at European level.<\/p> <p>  My first question is about online advertising targeting children.  Does Ms Vestager believe there should be a Europe-wide ban on such advertising?  Second, does she believe there should be a ban on surveillance-based advertising?  My third question is about algorithmic decision-making.  Algorithms can do lots of wonderful things, but if we do not guard against algorithmic bias, it will create many problems.  We are looking to develop a number of codes here, but is it an approach that should be adopted at European level?<\/p> <p>  My final question comes down to the issue of European values and the importance of data.  Does Ms Vestager view the right to data privacy as a European value?  I speak in the context of China, which is increasingly using data for surveillance purposes, and the challenges we know of in the US around security and commercial purposes.  How should Europe approach this?  One must be conscious of the Schrems decisions and the implication of that in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#C00700","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.  Tonight, many Danes will be singing around bonfires to celebrate midsummer.  Luckily, we have stopped burning women on the stake, which was a bad idea.  Now it is a much more peaceful thing.<\/p> <p>  I think it is a European value for a person to have the right to privacy.  It is important we make this a right that people know they can enforce.  By now, after the introduction of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, many people know they have rights but they find it difficult to know they are able to enforce those rights.  We still have some way to go.  We are trying to reflect that in new pieces of legislation, such as on artificial intelligence.  We use a metaphor of a pyramid.  At the bottom of the pyramid, where there is a lot of space, there are kinds of artificial intelligence we do not touch at all.  However, at the tip of the pyramid we find cases that we would completely prohibit.  There is no place in the European Union that a government would put in place a social scoring mechanism that puts citizens under surveillance and that, based on whether they pay their rent, jaywalk or are due a dental appointment - whatever it may be - they are allowed certain privileges or not.  We want that to be prohibited.<\/p> <p>  The second thing we want prohibited, as a matter of principle, is general biometric surveillance in public spaces.<\/p><p>Basically, someone would know where you were at all times.  The one exception would be that you could go to a judge and ask to be allowed to use it for a limited period of time, for example, in the search for a missing child or in the case of terrorist or other serious crimes.<\/p><p> Last but not least, we would also want to prohibit the use of subliminal techniques that would make people do something that could be harmful to them or to others.  We also try to take this value of privacy into other pieces of legislation so people can see that this is for real.<\/p><p> On the question of algorithms, we have quite a number of initiatives on algorithmic transparency.  One of the things would be an obligation for the providers to explain how their algorithm works.  We would not necessarily ask for the code itself but we would ask the developer to be able to say how this was actually working because, without that level of explainability, how can we trust that it works without a bias?  That is exactly how we would do it because there is a risk of bias if there is no transparency or no explainability with the algorithms being used.<\/p><p> On the question of online advertising, both targeting vulnerable people and also targeting the rest of us, this is where there have been some very heated discussions.  One of the areas where we have been a little careful is in the case of smaller businesses with a limited advertising budget because, for them, it can be a good thing to be able to reach potential customers.  Businesses with large advertising budgets do not mind so much, and although every business minds about its costs, they can afford to have much broader advertising practices.  I am more than willing to discuss how we can, for instance, protect children against targeted advertising, going further than the transparency we are suggesting right now.  People should know why they see an ad but I think it is important to be mindful of businesses which have very small advertising budgets because, for them, targeted advertising really makes the difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for appearing before the committee.  I have four questions.  How important is rural proofing to all of these ideas to make sure we do not leave anybody behind?  Young people use the most data and they are prominent users of social media.  How are the voices and perspectives of young people included in the regulatory work of the European Commission?  The Commissioner mentioned there are significant resources but what does she see as the key areas for funding?  The Commissioner spoke about data centres, which account for the biggest share of carbon emissions.  How can we reduce these emissions in this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#D00300","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The idea of rural proofing is to see how proposals work outside of an urban area because there is a difference between people living closer together and people living much more spread out.  These are different communities and there is a different dynamic, but that does not change the fact that we should be sensitive to these differences between urban and rural.  We are working to be better at doing that kind of analysis in order to see how legislation will work for everyone.<\/p> <p>  Second, on the question on how young people are being heard, that is a really good question because we do not necessarily have specific youth panels.  What we see is that there are a lot of young people worrying about having the right competences and whether we learn what we need to learn at school in order to be qualified for the jobs to come.  This is one of the reasons we treat digital skills as a very hard strategic priority, not with education as a side thing or by treating it as if we can always put education here or there, but that it is a central thing and, without education, it will not work.  I will take the inspiration and think about how more young people can be included.<\/p> <p>  It is also a point that goes for older people.  For those aged 70 years today, in the next 20 years digitisation will only increase and more and more public services will come in digital formats.  Therefore, it is never too late to get the digital skills in order for people to fully feel they are part of their society and they can benefit from the different services being delivered.  People who are 70 today may well be here for the next 20 or 30 years.  It is very important that we take the different generations on board in that respect.<\/p> <p>  On the key areas for investment, as I said earlier, I really think connectivity must be a key area and the second must be skills.  We cannot leave anyone to say that digital society is not for them and that it is not important whether they feel empowered or not.  The citizen&rsquo;s empowerment to deal with this is of the essence because, otherwise, there is a risk that we get societies where people do not feel they belong, and I think that is the worst thing that can happen.  They may be fired from a job but if they feel they are being fired from their country or their society, where do they go then?  Skills are of the essence.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the data centres, with regard to the technology to get the next generation of semiconductors to use less electricity and less power, we have what we call an important project of common European interest that is working exactly on semiconductors to bring that down.  The second thing is to organise the data centres so they can run on renewables, like everything else, but also that excess heating can be used.  I know it is a quirky example but in Paris they have organised a pool next to a data centre, so the excess heat actually heats the pool for the people living around the data centre.  I think that is quite a sweet example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner.  It is an honour to have her at our meeting.  She mentioned the draft Digital Markets Act which is being worked on by the EU, along with the Digital Services Act.  It sets out some rigid and non-negotiable rules for a lot of tech businesses, regardless of circumstances.  Is there any concern in the EU that it is a bit over-specific and inflexible and might lead to unintended consequences?  When I say &ldquo;unintended consequences&rdquo;, I am talking about the whole issue of sideloading.  There are concerns that this could allow incidents such as software holding user data to ransom and letting children bypass parental controls and, indeed, that it could lead to potential piracy.  Given the proposed draft, does the Commissioner have any concerns with what is there as this is seen to be non-negotiable at present?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#D00600","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>When we were developing the Digital Markets Act, we took our experience from competition law enforcement and focused on what we were seeing.  One of our main challenges was to make procedures more efficient.  Even when we move quite quickly, it takes time to bring a competition case, for obvious reasons.  First, we have to prove dominance and then we have to prove that there has been wrongdoing through an illegal behaviour.  The mechanism of using a Digital Markets Act is a bit different.  Beforehand, parties are designated as gatekeepers according qualitative and quantitative objective criteria.  The gatekeepers, and there will not be too many of them - maybe ten to 15, or something like that, have a number of obligations and a number of things they cannot do.  What they must do and cannot do is based on our experience from competition law enforcement and the experience of seeing unfair trading practices.  We are being quite specific, because otherwise, we would revert back to competition law enforcement.  The regulation is supposed to complement competition law enforcement.  There will still be competition cases, but not in the same way as before.<\/p> <p>  The question of data protection and security is a valid one.  However, it is far-reaching to suggest, for instance, that an app store other than the one you already have on your phone would be an irresponsible app store that would allow any kind of crap to be pushed onto you.  For all other providers, the same GDPR and privacy rules apply as for everyone else.  One of the things I find thought-provoking is that if I am not happy with the prices or the choice of my supermarket, I go to another one.  When it comes to app stores, once I buy my phone, there is a monopoly.

I wish the team all the best in the round of the last 16.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner touched on the issue of cybersecurity earlier.  As she will be aware and as she mentioned, we suffered a serious cyberattack here recently.  Does she feel that a pan-European approach needs to be taken to cybersecurity?  There have been calls for heavy investment in our own cybersecurity.  Is it something that needs to be done at European level, covering the whole Union?  Perhaps the Commissioner can speak more to that issue.  As we know, and as she has mentioned, the more dependent we become on digital, the more vulnerable we become.  We are small country of 4.5 million people, like the Commissioner's own country.  For a small country, it is a heavy burden to try to protect our digital space.

It was devastating and shocking to see Christian Eriksen collapsing on the field.  I find very touching the reaction of the entire football community to the events.  The football community and the fans have shown fair play and warmth.  I find it impressive.  Of course, Christian Eriksen is fine and out of hospital.  He had surgery.  In Denmark, many people have signed up for first aid classes to learn how to do life-saving CPR.  Therefore, something good will come of it.  Obviously, I will be proud if the members join me in hoping for the Danish team to make it through the game on Saturday.<\/p> <p>  On the question of cybersecurity, it is a bit tricky.  Of course, we have the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, which deals with cybersecurity.  The directive on the security of network and information systems is trying to increase the scope so that more sectors will also be legally obliged to have what it takes to protect themselves against cyberattacks.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, we see that there is room to do more.  As we increase the use of digital technology, we become more vulnerable.  It is not only about vulnerability in the sense that each and every one of us can make the mistake of clicking on a link that looks attractive but is basically a phishing exercise or something much worse than that, but more systemically, it is about protecting us against the real professional, malicious attacks that we see happening.  We hope to be able to apply six to eight \"socks\", which is technology that carries out surveillance by patrolling the networks and the cables to determine if an attack is imminent.<\/p> <p>  The second measure is to start up a joint cyber unit.  We are very much aware that cybersecurity is a national competence.  However, we are also aware that some of the attackers have a lot of resources at their disposal and it may be a good idea for member states to help each other both in their surveillance as to what is ongoing to help out if an attack is under way, but also to learn what happens during an attack so that it can be recognised by others and better prevented.  There are many things that we can do together without affecting the sovereignty of the member states.  Perhaps by co-operating more closely, we can increase the sovereignty of the member states.  I do not think states feel sovereign when they are experiencing a massive cyberattack.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for the reply.

We have not seen the number of digital companies growing to the same extent in Europe over the recent years.  In the Commissioner's vision for Europe in the digital age, what can we do to be able to support that creativity?  Part of it may relate to the relationship with some of the tech giants.  I am not sure if the Commissioner wants to comment on the ongoing Apple case, an issue which is much in the news in Ireland, but maybe she might comment on the relationship with the European Union and Apple and the antitrust case against Google that is being taken this week.

You find so many clever, entrepreneurial people within our Union.  What we have seen so far is that many of them will leave for the US for skilled employees and capital to come on board.  We have been trying to create better capital conditions by creating the capital union, because European companies often go to the bank and create more debts if they need capital on board, whereas in the US it is much more the custom that you go to the market and sell 5% or 10% of your business and not only do you get capital on board, you get new competences on board.  It is definitely not a given that the innovator or initial entrepreneur who has created a great product also holds the competences to scale that business.  We also want to create a different sort of capital market dynamic in Europe.<\/p> <p>  The second thing, and here there is a sense of urgency, is to make sure the industrial potential of Europe is being used in full because everything digitalises: energy, mobility, health and agriculture.  Those ought to be the triggering events for European industry to dominate the next big chapter of digitalisation.  That takes an open marketplace in order that they can get to their customers.  It takes capital, a capital market that is willing to take risks and, of course, a Single Market approach in order that solutions can be scaled up because a full Single Market is available.  I am quite enthusiastic about this but it will take considerable effort for us to use this industrial culture and potential to its full.<\/p> <p>  On the ongoing cases, actually we have quite a few tax cases.  The Apple tax case is under appeal and I cannot comment on that, but what was interesting for me to see is that some of the things we have been looking at before are coming back.  We have to look at the same behaviour, only in slightly different markets.  If it is a different market, there is a different dynamic, but the fundamental behaviour is very much the same.  One of the things that really underpins the Digital Markets Act is that the things we have seen before should be straightforwardly prohibited in order that we do not have to spend the resources to redo investigations we have done before, with the risk of smaller businesses being squeezed out of the market in the meantime.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the digital wallet, our ambition is that it should work like a passport.  You have a national passport but it is also a European passport.  It is the same idea.  You have a national e-identity and it should work all over Europe as well.  If you can use your own identity to log in to different services, you can much better control what data you deliver or what trace you track after yourself.<\/p> <p>  The second beneficial thing is that you can create trust.  Other people will know that if you choose to identify yourself, it is really you.  That is one of the things which is really lacking online.  I appreciate that you can be there anonymously, but I also appreciate that I know who I am dealing with.  That can make the Internet a much more trusted place, if we get this to work.  Having a wallet in which you can also stash your birth certificate, educational certificates and all of this can make your life much easier in the administrative procedures you have to go through in life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Margrethe Vestager"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Can I ask the Commissioner a question about the digital currency?

We are, I hope, working our way slowly but surely out of a viral pandemic that has crippled Europe and the wider world.  Throughout, we have become overwhelmed with misinformation.  One might call it a misinformation pandemic.  The after-effects of that may linger for significantly longer than will the effects of the pandemic itself.  I recall Neelie Kroes in 2014 taking a significant step forward in empowering our young children to become more adept at manipulating technology and beginning that wonderful initiative that was EU Code Week.<\/p> <p>  In the aftermath of the pandemic, in the knowledge that our young people in particular need quickly to develop the skills necessary to become exceptionally digitally literate to be able to parse, analyse and critique all the information they encounter on the Internet using social media and other platforms, is it now time - perhaps this is something the Commission is already contemplating doing - to have a European-wide programme of digital literacy education for our young people, at both primary and post-primary level, that gives them those kinds of critiquing, parsing and analytical skills that are so crucial at a time they will most definitely be subjected to misinformation on a scale that is simply incomparable with what we encountered as young people growing up in the EU?

Someone told me the other day that the risk of someone passing on an article that is misinformation is higher with my generation or the slightly older one.  It is definitely not always young people who are the source of misinformation or who pass it on; it can very well be people of other ages.  It is important, therefore, to have a broad scope when we are discussing how to ensure we will get the exact competences the Deputy mentioned.<\/p> <p>  EU Code Week is ongoing because it is a great initiative, and it is encouraging to be part of this.  We also have events - what we call hackathons - because it is intriguing and interesting to see what can be achieved in perhaps just 24 hours if skilled people work in teams on a certain area.  Solutions can be found and that is an inspiration too.  We have an ongoing project to determine whether we can create a European digital certificate, similar to the one for languages, where somebody can receive qualifications of C1, B2, B1 and so on for his or her skill level.  We could have the same for digital skills in order that employers could easily recognise what kind of digital skill a young person or an experienced person has, and he or she will be able to travel with those digital skills.  We are in the process of developing that.  At the same time, it will not apply to each and every one of us such that if we just become more clued in, we will not be misinformed.<\/p> <p>  We have also strengthened the code of conduct.  It is soft law, but all the big companies, such as the US ones, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as TikTok and Mozilla, have signed up for a number of actions to ensure that misinformation will be suppressed.  During the pandemic, for instance, they sought to ensure that when a person was seeking Covid information, he or she would see the official information from the local health ministry as the first result.  We strengthened the code because we found there was room for the platforms to do better.<\/p><p>Here, of course, the next step will be the Digital Services Act.  This will give them new obligations.

She has had a busy hour responding to all of our members.  I also thank our members.  At the risk of sounding repetitive, which is not what I want to do, the Commissioner has covered everything comprehensively.  It falls to me to conclude.  The erosion of democracy is something that has left our countries and world highly vulnerable.  We saw what happened on Capitol Hill.  We saw the power of digital media and social media and the implications it had on Capitol Hill, which would have been unimaginable had anybody suggested it would be possible.  This is why I believe the work being done by the Commissioner is hugely important for all of us as a country.<\/p> <p>  Having attended the Conference on the Future of Europe, I am mindful that one of the important pieces of policy work the conference will do is on digital transformation and on the idea the Commissioner has comprehensively addressed today on leaving nobody behind, whether people live in rural or urban areas, whether they are female or male or their age.  None of this should matter and this is a very good objective.<\/p> <p>  To reflect on what the Commissioner and members have said, during the pandemic we had an attack on our health service.  This was probably at the most vulnerable time in the history of the State.  It proved very difficult for those on the front line in an already-impossible situation.  I feel very strongly about a point that has been touched on, which is that in the work being done by the Commissioner, it will be hugely important to find a way to ensure that information going out is legitimate, trusted and independent.  This is crucial in the work being done by the Commissioner.  It has been critical throughout the pandemic with regard to Covid deniers.  The voice and platform misinformation gets is equally as powerful as the correct and legitimate information.  We have to find a way at European level and here in our own country to ensure we suppress the misinformation that can get out.  It led people astray in the situation the world found itself in with the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  I do not have any questions because the Commissioner has covered everything so well.

It is still much easier to understand people we disagree with when we see them in real life.  It is a different thing to say to someone's face what some people write in online commentary.  We should never forget this when raising our children.  We must keep reminding ourselves as adults that democracy depends on a civilised way of disagreeing, listening to one another and perhaps finding ways of agreeing.

The MEAI would also like to thank most sincerely the members of this committee and Members of the Oireachtas in general who have raised issues relating to this sector and offered their voice and assistance to the association on numerous occasions.<\/p> <p>  On 12 March 2020, the music and entertainment industry ground to a sudden halt as a result of Covid-19.  As the days passed beyond the initial lockdown, it became apparent that as long as social distancing was a requirement to slow the spread of Covid-19, the industry would be at its mercy.  As of today, 23 June 2021, we are now on day 469 of lockdown or of severe restrictions which prevent those in our sector from working.  On 27 April 2021, the MEAI made a written submission to this joint committee on the Impact of Covid-19 on the music and entertainment sector.  In that submission, we highlighted a number of areas of concern for consideration including social protection, banking issues, business supports from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, sector-specific supports from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and guidelines, consideration and provisions for reopening.  Since then, the landscape has changed considerably and issues relating to certain topics in that submission require urgent and swift action.  These issues are: the proposed cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, from September and the transitioning of recipients on the lowest rate to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, thus classifying them as unemployed; the need for social protection measures and sector supports when the sector is in a state of phased reopening and for those supports to continue until the sector can function fully without restrictions or social distancing; the fact that the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, contains criteria to which other Government supports are not subject, namely, minimum business costs and publication of recipients; and the fact that F&aacute;ilte Ireland guidelines, which state that no live or loud music or performances are permitted, are preventing the sector from a phased reopening process - we would like to see test gigs conducted in licensed premises and social settings so that guidelines can be created for the safe and responsible return of live entertainment in those settings.  We recommend that the VAT rate for our sector be aligned with that relating to the tourism and hospitality sector because this would provide a meaningful stimulus and support for the sector when reopening can take place.<\/p><p> There is a great lack of understanding of and various misconceptions about the nature of the music and entertainment sector and how it works.  The Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas we have been fortunate enough to engage with over the past 16 months all have an understanding of the severity of the problems and have empathy and sympathy for the situation, but this compassion and comprehension is not necessarily reflected in the slow roll-out of the supports we have been promised up to now.

We understand also, from speaking to the Department of Social Protection, that any expenses during that are only applied to the eight-week period as well.  If earnings and expenses were taken over the course of the year, as in a normal business, that would be a more understandable way of looking at it.  We are concerned at the moment people may be in a position where, if they get some employment in July or August, they will be forced to sign off the PUP and then they will have no support further on into winter.

I have one quick observation to make and then a question to follow it.  As we recover from the pandemic and begin slowly to reopen our economy, there are sections of the economy where it is exceptionally straightforward to determine they are open, functioning and providing full employment.  For example, if hairdressers are open, they are open.  Their employees come back and they provide that service.  Due to the nature of the music industry, that coming back process is going to be very slow and transitionary in nature.  As Mr. McGranaghan said earlier, it is also affected by the normal seasonal ebbs and flows of the industry in any event.  What do our guests suggest is the best model for continuing to support artists and technicians in the music and entertainment industry, which would allow for the transitional phase to happen in a successful manner so nobody goes over the edge and ceases to be part of the industry and that they are supported and nurtured back to full health, if I can put it that way?  I suspect that will not happen until sometime early next summer.  That is my assessment of how long this is going to take.  For our guests, as representatives of that industry, what is the best model to allow for that support to continue in a very effective way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021062300002#L01300","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  One of the most effective supports we have is the PUP.  When we see that being reduced come September, we are very concerned that is going to be a repeat of last year whereby, as other sectors slowly reopened, there were reductions and then, as the larger lockdown happened in October, the rate went back up again.  The PUP is a critical life support but it should be enhanced with additional supports.  The LPSS is a very good support.  We could be critical of certain aspects of it, certainly, and it does not get out all the time to everyone who needs it, so we must look at other ways of ensuring subsidies can be given right across all the different sectors.<\/p> <p>  One of the greatest supports could be to make guidelines that will allow for work to happen in a safe and responsible manner and not just put this blanket ban on.

With regard to MEBAS, they do not seem themselves as businesses, even though that is what they are.  The language used has deterred people from applying.

What structure should be in place to ensure engagement with the sector in future?  I am also conscious of the question of universal basic income, a matter Senator Carrigy raised.

There is also the matter of setting up areas for people to get tested and holding areas for them to wait for their results.  If that is the only way forward and if venues can only open up with antigen testing, that is okay.  It is quite interesting.  Over the long weekend two weeks ago, many people were out drinking, eating and socialising in the streets.  It will be interesting to see the results of that.  It is almost like an unofficial test because there were so many people out on the streets enjoying the good weather and having food and a bit to drink.

The fact that there is so much stuff on sale means that even the equipment they are selling is not worth as much as it should be.  That is creating its own problems.  From July, the rate paid to people who earned less than &euro;200 a week before the pandemic will drop to the level of the jobseeker's payments.  There is no protection for them whereas there are certain protections for those on the pandemic unemployment payment.  The mental stress out there is unbelievable.

Regarding MEBAS, we must, in fairness, give credit to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  She has done great work in advocating for the industry.  Could more be done?  Yes, it probably could.  However, MEBAS is the only non-competitive support afforded to the industry and the Minister fought hard to make that happen.  Every other support given to this industry so far is competitive.  Looking at business supports such as the CRSS and the small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, those are not competitive schemes.  Support is provided once the eligibility criteria are met.  Unfortunately, there are criteria involved even in MEBAS which are not present in other Government support schemes such as the SBASC.  We have a minimum business cost to produce.  Strand 2 of MEBAS, for example, offers grant support of &euro;4,000 on turnover of more than &euro;50,000 and up to &euro;100,000.

I am sure, however, that she would welcome the opportunity to provide the relevant information to the committee and, ultimately, to the MEAI concerning the plans for the &euro;50 million in non-competitive funding which must be made available to the artists and crews.  Mr. McGranaghan was right when he mentioned the timeframe and it having been seven or eight months since that announcement.  A great deal of money is still to be disbursed to artists.  An announcement was made last week concerning live performance venues that had been successful in their applications to the LPSS, and that was welcome.  In my constituency, however, only one venue was successful in that regard.  Such a successful application can be a lifeline for the bands, musicians and crews involved, and it is important.  That may be another strand of work for this committee to undertake.<\/p> <p>  With the blessing of the members, I suggest that we write to the Minister regarding Mr. McGranaghan's final point concerning the &euro;50 million in funding which was announced and how it is intended or expected that the remainder of that funding will be disbursed to those most in need of such support.  It is really a survival mechanism.  As Mr. Conboy stated, bands and musicians are selling equipment, and for far less than it is worth, because there is no timeline in sight yet for the type of reopening which will allow those in the sector to use such equipment to perform again.  It is awful to hear those stories, but they are a reality and it is important that we hear them.  Is it agreed that the committee will write to the Minister regarding this issue?  Agreed.

Witnesses are reminded long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially damaging to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses who are attending remotely from outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.

I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked, reluctantly, to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of Leinster House campus.

By way of background, the Commission for Aviation Regulation was established in 2001.  We have a number of duties.  These including the following. We set the maximum price the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, can collect from airport charges at Dublin Airport.  We review the costs and revenues of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, as air navigation service provider.  We license Irish-based air carriers and authorise ground-handlers.  We investigate complaints about flight cancellations, delays of at least two hours, and instances of denied boarding.  This is more usually referred to as \"EC-261 rules\".  We investigate complaints about assistance received by passengers with reduced mobility.  We license travel agents and tour operators established in Ireland and administer a bonding scheme for licensed travel agents and tour operators.  We process claims if a travel agent or tour operator goes out of business.  I now turn to describe our work in relation to the Irish travel trade sector.<\/p> <p>  Tour operators and travel agents established in Ireland apply to our organisation for a 12-month contract.  These licences are usually renewed in April and October of each year.  We spread them out between the April and October round.  We issue a licence when the company has fulfilled certain criteria.  This licensing framework has been in place since 1982, although it has been updated over the years to reflect the ongoing monitoring requirements and a number of European directives that came into play in the intervening years. <\/p> <p>  To give the committee a feel for the number of licences, in 2020, we issued 181 licences - 24 for tour operators and 157 for travel agents.  This is a reduction compared to 2019 when we issued 211 licences.  During the year, we monitor our licensees, where they provide us with a variety of information, including monthly and quarterly management accounts and audited annual accounts. This is our only role in relation to solvent tour operators and travel agents.  <\/p> <p> We have a second role and this is where, unfortunately, a tour operator or travel agent is unable to fulfil its obligations to its customers and becomes insolvent.  As part of the licensing process a tour operator is required to put in place a bond calculated as 10% of its projected licensable turnover.  Effectively, that means its forecast future sales for the years ahead.  It must give us a bond for 10% of that amount.  For travel agents, a figure of 4% applies.  These same figures have applied since the 1980s.  In the event that a tour operator or travel agent becomes insolvent, we call on their bond to cover the cost of consumer claims.  Where the bond is insufficient, there is also in place a travellers&rsquo; protection fund.  This is used to cover legitimate claims, where the size of the claim exceeds the amount of the bond.  In this way, the customer is completely covered for legitimate claims.  In principle, the insolvency protection arrangements cover packages - for example, accommodation, flights and transfer from the airport to the hotel would be considered a package - where travel starts in Ireland and where the package has been cancelled due to the insolvency of the licensee.  There are some requirements that need to be met for the claim to be included in the scheme.  In addition, flights from Ireland, booked through a licensee are also covered.  It is important to bear in mind, though, that certain sales are not covered.  These include accommodation only, and items such as visas and insurance.  The important factors are it is a package, the travel starts in Ireland, and the package is cancelled due to the insolvency of the licensee.  <\/p> <p>  Under secondary legislation dating back to 1983, claimants have 60 days from the date of the collapse to make a claim to us.<\/p><p>We are in the process of extending the claim period to 120 days to provide affected customers with more time to submit a claim to CAR.  In fact, we have had that in place since Monday of this week and it has been completed.  One of the concerns raised by merchant service providers was that we had only a 60-day period.  We have now extended that period to 120 days, which aligns with some of the period they apply for customers making a claim to them, something I will come to later.<br\/><br\/>In June 2020, the Government introduced a refund credit note scheme.  This allows licensed tour operators and trade agents to offer refund credit notes to their customers where a booking has been cancelled due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.  By voluntarily accepting a note, customers could book another package holiday in the future and the Government will back the value of the note in the event of insolvency.  This arrangement was put in place to provide additional support to travel agents and tour operators, which are required, under a recent European directive, to provide a refund to customers in certain circumstances .  This arrangement allowed them to offer their customers a refund credit note and that allowed the companies more time to get their own rebate from their suppliers.  At the same time, the Government provided that the travellers' protection fund would be maintained, which was another important aspect of the additional arrangements put in place last year. <br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, merchant service providers give travel agents and tour operators the ability to accept debit and credit cards in payment for goods and services and they charge for this facility.  I understand, from travel industry representatives, that some providers have required significant upfront financial security deposits.  CAR is not a party to these discussions and does not play a role in these commercial relationships.  It is a matter between the merchant service provider and the business in question.<br\/><br\/>There is one point of interaction between merchant service providers and CAR and this relates to how consumer financial protection arrangements operate in the event of a travel agent or tour operator becoming insolvent.  Following an insolvency, an affected customer may seek to recover moneys from us or from the merchant service provider.  If the customer submits a claim to CAR, it falls under the insolvency protection arrangements.  The customer may also request the credit or debit card provider to consider reversing a transaction because the travel agent or tour operator has not delivered the services paid for.  This is called a charge-back.<br\/><br\/>In early 2016, in discussions with some merchant service providers, we provided clarity on how our two processes should work.  We agreed that CAR would be the first point of contact for the customer.  Therefore, if we determined that the customer should be paid under the insolvency protection arrangements, the customer would then not be considered in the charge-back process.  This gives clarity to the merchant service provider that the person will come to us first and we will determine whether he or she is part of our scheme.  If the person is part of our scheme, he or she will not be included in the merchant service provider scheme.  If we determine that the claim is not covered in whole or in part under the insolvency protection arrangements, we notify the claimant accordingly and he or she can provide this information to his or her credit or debit card issuer where he or she chooses to explore the charge-back route.  This is an important point.  In this way, we provide clarity to the merchant service provider about what our role and its role are, and we are the first point of contact.  It goes through our service first, before going down the charge-back route.  <br\/><br\/>As for our process for reviewing claims, when a travel company becomes insolvent, its customers can access a claims form on our website, <i>aviationreg.ie<\/i>.  We then assess each submitted form, together with all supporting documentation such as receipts, itinerary and proof of purchase.  At the end of this process, we decide whether the claim can be settled in full, in part or rejected, and we notify the claimant accordingly.  The claimant has an opportunity to have the decision reviewed, and in a number of cases, we have reviewed decisions.<br\/><br\/>At the end of this process, if the claim is not covered in whole or in part by Ireland's insolvency protection arrangements, and if the claimant has paid by credit or debit card, we suggest they may be entitled to a charge-back from his or her bank and that the claimant contact his or her bank if this is the case.  We suggest they provide the bank with our communication as evidence that the claimant does not have a claim under the bond or refund credit note scheme of the insolvent travel company.<br\/><br\/>It cannot be any clearer than that.  The consumer goes through our process first.  If they get the money from our process, all well and good, and if they are not eligible under our scheme, we communicate this to them and he or she brings that to the bank in order that the bank will know that the consumer has been through our process first.  In addition, where we can, we have provided any necessary clarity to merchant service providers that have contacted us over the years about how Ireland's insolvency protection arrangements work and what is covered by the scheme. <br\/><br\/>I will conclude with a summary of recent insolvencies.  In 2020, six collapses resulted in claims, the largest of which was USIT Travel Limited, which ceased trading on 27 March.  In total in 2020, we received more than 3,600 claims and these have been closed out.  In 2021, there has been two insolvencies, the later of which was Joe Walsh Pilgrimitours Limited, which ceased trading on 27 April.  To date, we have received roughly 2,489 claims relating to Joe Walsh Pilgrimtours Limited.  We are reviewing these claims and have started to pay out on them.<br\/><br\/>I hope the committee now has a clear view of our role in respect of the travel trade in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#B00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion.  This meeting was prompted by concerns raised by the travel agency sector.  Ms Mannion referred to significant sums.  The sector is reporting that in some instances, a cash security of &euro;1.5 million is being sought at short notice.  It has expressed concern that this may have an impact on the sector and that it may, in fact, contribute to and cause failures within the sector.  It has raised a further concern that there has been no indication or basis outlined for the decisions being made by the merchant service providers.  There have been references to risk but there is no proof of that risk and no clear indication.  There has been a suggestion that a differentiation has not been made between the bonded system here and the non-bonded system elsewhere, or between Britain and Ireland.  The processes employed in Britain are just being transferred to Ireland in an entirely different context, and that is of concern.<\/p> <p>  Is the commission aware of that concern?  Does it share that concern for an industry for which the commission has responsibility in licensing?  Does Ms Mannion have an opinion on how that issue could be resolved?  What level of engagement has the commission had with the merchant service providers, for example, and what have been their asks?  I note the point about the 60-day period versus the 120-day period.  Have there been any other requests?

That was in response to requests from service providers and followed discussions with our Department.  I just wanted to say those key things.  Our door is always open.

I accept that she will not able to agree with what I have to say but I want to use a little of my time to make a brief statement.  As a sector, travel agents have been ravaged.  They pay a bond fee to the Commission for the Aviation Regulation, at 4% of their annual turnover, as a safety net to ensure that if somebody goes totally insolvent, or if there are issues with air fare refunds, there will be some clawback and something there to protect them.<\/p><p>What I have been alarmed by over recent months is that these merchant service providers are on the wings.  Depending on how one views them, they are either an asset to protect the consumer, which they are, given that a person can book by card and there is an additional safety net there, or a vulture to many in the sector because, in some instances, they demand cash security deposits as high as 30% of projected turnover.  In one case in Ireland, they demanded a cash security deposit of &euro;1.5 million, which was absolutely ludicrous and would be crippling for businesses that are trying to function to some degree of normality and have fallen well short of that over the past 15 months.  They are striving to recover, but that will be impossible when they are being charged more than seven times what the commission requires them to hold as a bond.  The merchant service providers are hanging around asking for seven times that.  I accept that Ms Mannion cannot comment on this and I have heard what she said in response to other members, but I just wanted to make that point.<\/p><p>Ms Mannion sat on the aviation recovery task force last year.  One aspect of its report related specifically to the commission's role and I want to home in on it.  Recommendation No. 5, on Dublin Airport, states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe regulatory regime as overseen by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) should continue to apply to Dublin Airport, with a planned Interim Review of the current price-cap determination to be held in the coming months.  Airlines should continue to pay all airport and air navigation charges relating to Dublin.  The Government should provide a rebate directly to the airlines of all Dublin Airport charges and air navigation charges as paid by the airlines.  This would represent State Aid, and it would have to be notified to the European Commission for approval in accordance with State Aid Rules. <\/blockquote> <p>People have bemoaned the fact that recommendations from the aviation task force have not been implemented.  Again, I do not expect Ms Mannion to comment on that, given that the task force met as a broad entity and we are not individualising this.  Nevertheless, one issue I have seen in the report is that it was intended for the continuance of the commission's regulatory functions at Dublin Airport, so it still has all of this scope.<\/p><p>As we approach the end of June and look to 19 July as a date from which international air travel will resume, and as we look to the sector bouncing back, is there anything Ms Mannion can say to people who are tuned in and who work in the aviation sector, such as travel agents and others who are concerned about where the sector in general is going, in regard to how pricing charges and the regulatory framework that is in place can be used in a positive discriminatory way to ensure that air travel into and out of Ireland will be shared better with the regions, rather than funnelling everything through our national airport?  Dublin Airport is important - do not get me wrong - but it is equally important to have economic recovery in the regions and air travel to them.  Is there anything in the current regulatory framework that could be used as a positive discrimination tool?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#E00800","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Our remit is to set the charge for Dublin Airport.

It supports 140,000 jobs and attracts 8.8 million overseas tourists arriving by air.  The recent announcement by Aer Lingus that it is closing its crew base at Shannon Airport is a devastating blow to the airport, the Aer Lingus employees and the region generally.  It is an indicator of the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the sector nationally and globally.  The collapse in international travel, through effectively halting aviation in Ireland, has the potential to cause further severe and long-term damage to a critical driver of our economy in the absence of a clear and actionable plan to restore air services to regional airports.  It is against that background that we have prepared a business case setting out the urgent need for a multi-annual, fully funded, regional air access recovery and growth action plan for the aviation sector.  The business case we have prepared outlines the three levels of multi-annual funding airports will require until at least 2024, and potentially as late as 2029, to restore international connectivity to 2019 traffic levels.  That time span is based on EUROCONTROL's most optimistic forecast for a return of Europe's air traffic to 2019 levels.<\/p> <p>  The three funding levels are the following.  First is multi-year capital expenditure funding to enable our regional airports to survive during the recovery period.  Funding of the order of &euro;32 million annually has already been provided by the Government, and we welcome that.  That level of funding will need to be sustained over the period of the crisis.  The second category of funding is a doubling of Tourism Ireland's tourism marketing funding from &euro;47 million to &euro;94 million, together with an industry activation fund of &euro;92 million over three years, as called for in previous task force reports to the Government.  Finally, and as covered in the aviation task force report from last year, is a fixed euro amount per passenger to subsidise airport charges to enable airlines to restore critical routes to and from North America, the UK and Europe as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  To substantiate the business case, particularly for the last item, the fixed euro amount per passenger, we have prepared a detailed traffic recovery support scheme, which we call the TRSS for short, providing costings for the airport charges element of the business case.  The model is based on a review of international traffic and route support schemes in operation in countries such as Spain, Denmark and Cyprus and in other parts of the world, and has been prepared using Shannon Airport's 2019 traffic levels to estimate the level of funding required.  The current assumptions in the financial model show a total cost range of between &euro;20 million and &euro;39 million for Shannon Airport for the period July 2021 to June 2024.  It is calculated based on giving airlines a percentage refund of monthly all-inclusive passenger charges.  The idea is that they will get the refund based on the percentage of traffic they deliver to an airport compared with the same month in 2019.  To be eligible for a refund, an airline would need to achieve or exceed monthly traffic thresholds.  All the detailed assumptions are set out in the model we have shared with you, Chairman.  While the calculations are based on Shannon Airport's traffic figures for 2019, the model can also be used to quantify the funding requirement for all airports, based on their 2019 traffic levels, using the CSO data we have added to the model.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the Government's special package of &euro;80 million for aviation, which included an EU state aid approved allocation of &euro;20 million for route incentives and charge rebates at Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports covering the winter period that has just finished.  We also welcome the &euro;200 million in horizontal supports which have been provided to the sector through wage subsidies, rates waivers and so on.  However, our business case shows that the levels of supports provided to airports and airlines will need to increase substantially and be multi-annual rather than focused on the recently completed winter season.  The TRSS costs over a multi-annual period, whether for Shannon alone or for all State-owned airports combined, is a fraction of the economic impact of the aviation sector.  For example, the maximum three-year cost of airport charges support for Shannon Airport is less than the annual local economy and Exchequer spend in respect of just three hotels in the region where I am sitting today, Dromoland Castle Hotel, Shannon Springs Hotel and the Great National South Court Hotel, Limerick.<\/p> <p>  The International Air Transport Association, IATA, has been consistently making the case for international government action to stimulate market recovery in the face of the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors.  The TRSS we are presenting to the Government is our solution to stimulating such a recovery in Ireland, so we are very much in solution mode.  Again, I emphasise that as Shannon Chamber, together with the Irish Hotels Federation and with the support of Galway, Ennis and Limerick chambers, we believe Ireland must adopt this approach, given what is happening internationally, with &euro;173 billion given by governments globally to airlines and airports since the onset of Covid-19, and that is just up to December 2020.  We will be facing into a very competitive aviation marketplace once travel restrictions lift, with airlines favouring airports with lower airport charges and route support facilitating fare reductions to attract and reignite passenger numbers growth.  Ireland's regional airports simply must be enabled to compete.  That is why we need and must have a clear, actionable and fully funded plan to restore connectivity to this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompstone"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":741,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thompstone.

We had representatives of Aer Lingus before the committee yesterday.  Mr. Thompstone may have had an opportunity to see the proceedings.  We were trying to understand why an airline such as Aer Lingus would not make commitments to an airport such as Shannon Airport even though the State is providing significant support to it through loans, etc.  From Mr. Thompstone's experience, does he believe one of the best approaches is to support the airport in the region with the necessary funding to ensure connectivity, and that this is ultimately how we might best achieve the balanced-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#H01000","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":748,"content":"<p>We shall suspend the meeting for some minutes to resolve a technical issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#J00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1624402800,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.51 p.m. and resumed at 1.53 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":750,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Thompstone start his response to Senator Dooley from the beginning?

If they have lower airport charges, that increases their potential to restore routes they were previously providing.  When we looked at what was happening around the world, we found that the airport in Copenhagen, for example, is providing airport charge rebates, starting at 45% this year, to airlines that are connecting Copenhagen to global hubs.  We found this was being done in Cyprus as early as last summer.  In Spain, the authorities have introduced a system that is very straightforward and simple.  They are saying that a rebate will be given on airport charges <i>pro rata<\/i>based on the level of traffic this year compared to that in 2019, before Covid.<br\/><br\/>The critical piece in our model is that the Government would provide the airport with the cash needed to pass on lower airport charges to airports.  Why do we say &quot;to airports&quot;?  It is because the airports currently do not have any income stream because the airlines are not flying.  If they can be got back flying, an income stream will come in.  The airports need the income stream to run their operations.  It is for a defined period.  We have modelled from July of this year to June 2024 to coincide with the optimistic scenario coming from EUROCONTROL.  The idea is that, for the defined period, regional state airports, in particular, would get a sum in euro per passenger and, in turn, pass on the saving to the airlines, but with the incentive that if the airline hit a threshold based on 2019 levels of traffic, it would get back a portion of its airport charges <i>pro rata<\/i>.  We start the rate at 35% this year, rising to 50% next year, and then to 70% and, ultimately, 80%.  Indeed, if an airline reached a higher level, it would also get back a <i>pro rata<\/i>rebate.  If it reached 100% of its 2019 level, it would get back the full rebate.  The arrangement is designed to be very straightforward and easy to understand.  If 2019 levels are reached, one gets back a proportion of the airport charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompstone"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":752,"content":"<p>That is very good.

Coming from the Shannon region &ndash; others will have a similar view &ndash; I believe it is about ensuring the best outcome as the recovery takes place in Ireland, which is ultimately a small island where airlines are trying to consolidate for the obvious reason that they are under enormous pressure.  They are trying to consolidate out of one location, principally Dublin.  Is there anything in the schemes Mr. Thompstone has devised that can be applied exclusively to Shannon Airport?  The bottom line is that if there is a scheme that covers all airports, they will try to reduce their costs, as we know.  They have already got rid of the crew base at Shannon Airport.  Mr. Thompstone, from his experience, will be conscious of the state aid rules and all that go with them, as am I.  Is there an imaginative way to design a scheme that would protect the foundations at Shannon Airport so we could build upon them to protect and enhance the recovery in the region?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#J00600","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":753,"content":"<p>In response to what Senator Dooley is saying, the first point is that in July 2020 the Aviation Task Force, in its recommendations on airport charges, said the Commission for Aviation Regulation should decide on charges for Dublin Airport as it would normally.  Separately, for the regional airports, particularly the regional State-owned airports of Cork and Shannon, there is a need for some kind of intervention to incentivise airlines to come back in.  The proposal we are putting forward would be for the regional airports, including those in Shannon and Cork but also those in Donegal, Knock and Kerry.  The reason for that, from a state aid point of view, is that we are trying to minimise the red-circling.  The more one red-circles in respect of a geographical area or sector, the greater the issues from a state aid point of view.  Therefore, we are trying to make it very much a regional issue.  After that, it is really up to the airports and airlines to work together.  The most innovative airports will attract the traffic in the end.  Shannon Airport has a strong base from which to work.  One should remember that we are talking about restoring routes that were viable up to 2019.  It is not about new business; it is about getting back the Shannon-Heathrow, Shannon-New York and Shannon-Boston services and so on.  This also applies to other airports.  The services in question are what provide the passenger feed for the hospitality and leisure sectors and what enable internationally traded companies in Ireland, be they foreign owned or Irish owned, to engage with their customers and supply chains and so on.  The connectivity is vital.  It is very much about regional connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompstone"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thompstone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#J00800","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

There have been some lifesaving measures provided by the Government in supports but we need a pathway forward and we need to ensure that it is a multiannual approach.  There is a strong emphasis on multiannual in this report, be it capital expenditure funding or incentives around passengers and marketing.  Shannon Airport is so important to the mid-west and the western region and to all the hospitality and businesses that need this vital connectivity.  I want to emphasise that point.

The Shannon-Heathrow route is a scheduled service and we have three flights a day.  Pre-Covid we were at about 40 flights a week.  That Shannon-Heathrow connectivity connects Ireland to a global hub in London Heathrow.  In my day-to-day commercial business I spend most of my time in countries around the world, be it in Africa, the Middle East Asia and Europe.   I would fly to a client's location for one week or two weeks.  Typically, I could be found at 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday evening catching that Shannon service into Heathrow and then I would take an overnight flight from Heathrow and arrive into southern Africa or the Middle East or Asia.  What is interesting about doing this regularly is that I meet other business people, from not just the Shannon free zone but also from Galway, Limerick and other areas who are catching that very same flight.  We will also usually meet in the connection centre at Heathrow going to all corners of the earth.  Similarly, the route is a vital link for the tourism side.  Transatlantic connection is very important but Heathrow is also a source for generating a significant amount of back haul traffic into Shannon Airport and the wider Wild Atlantic Way.  <\/p> <p>  I will put this into perspective.  Transatlantic Shannon Airport numbers in 2018 would have been the bones of 500,000 or 450,000 passengers on transatlantic services.  Consider hotels such as Dromoland Castle in Clare.  It would have had about 16,000 American bed nights up to 2018-2019 and 75% to 80% of those would have come through Shannon Airport.  That business is gone.  The same situation applies to many of the Irish Hotels Federation member companies that Elaina is representing today.  A scheduled service like that and the connectivity it provides to a global market is absolutely vital for the hotel industry, the hospitality industry and the leisure sector.  It is also vital for foreign direct investment and Irish owned businesses who are trading internationally.

I was very interested in reading the traffic recovery support scheme, TRSS, statement on how that would work.  Perhaps Mr. Thompstone will give us some figures on how he came up with the projected numbers that he has.  I assume that they are coming from the European model of what will come out after recovery.  Mr. Thompstone has answered most of the questions I had about being back to the 2019 levels, and if the airlines do not reach that level they do not get a refund or whatever.  Obviously then there is the exponential growth and the more flights they bring in the more passengers they bring in.  I do not have to tell anyone in this room how important the flights are - especially those Shannon-Heathrow connections - for the economy, for business and for families.  A lot of Irish people have family connections in the UK and there are ongoing connections too.  Will Mr. Thompstone outline for the committee the concerns that the chamber is getting from business people?  Are they concerned about the cabin crew base going from Shannon?  Do the businesses see this as a threat to the Heathrow slot?  Are they telling the IHF that they are concerned about that?  Will Mr. Thompson give us feedback on what he is hearing from the businesses?<\/p> <p>  I would also like some more information on how Mr. Thompstone has modelled the figures.  I worked in the travel industry for 19 years and I know how difficult it is to get routes in and especially to bring them back once they have ceased being with an airline.  My time is very short and I appreciate Mr. Thompstone answering those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#K00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  On the TRSS and how it works, at a minimum level and just month by month, consider July this year for example.  We would say to airlines that if they hit a minimum level of 35% of the traffic they had in July 2019, we will give them back the same proportion of their airport charges.  We are not saying that it is 1%, 2% or 3%: the airlines must hit a minimum threshold.  We want something back from the airlines, which is a minimum level of traffic.  If the airlines hit that we would give them back their airport charges <i>pro rata<\/i>.  If they go above that and hit 50%, 60%, 80% or 100% they will get back those charges also.  If every airline was to hit 2019 levels of traffic just at the threshold level of 35% this year, going up to 50% next year and graduating up to 80% the total cost would be &euro;20 million over the three years of the programme.  If every airline was to hit 100% the total cost would be &euro;38 million or &euro;39 million.  This is the  equivalent - at the upper end - of what three hotels, for example Dromoland Castle, Shannon Springs Hotel and the South Court Hotel in Limerick, would pay out in wages and Exchequer contributions annually.  So the payback is very quick.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the Aer Lingus decision to close the cabin crew base at Shannon, it is regrettable.  I particularly feel for the Aer Lingus employees and staff there.  While I do not know many of them not personally, as a frequent user of the airport I know all of their faces and their names.  It is important to emphasise, however, that although Aer Lingus is taking the crews out this does not necessarily mean that Aer Lingus will not be bringing the services back.  It would mean that they will have to position crews into Shannon.  The business community's questions on this are about whether there are any implications for the timings of flights in and out of Shannon airport as a result.  The same would apply to Cork Airport if any such decision was to be made there in the future.  I heard the CEO engaging yesterday with the chairman.  Aer Lingus is obviously under significant financial pressure and are now looking at every angle to cut costs.  This brings us back to why the traffic recovery support scheme is so important.  We must recognise that for a defined period of time the airports are going to be in difficulty and need to be sustained during the recovery period.  That is when governments should be intervening, when there is a market failure and when there is a problem particularly with economic infrastructure.  I put it to the committee that connectivity to Heathrow, to Europe and to north American market is a critical piece of economic infrastructure to the whole of the Atlantic economic corridor, wherever one is in that space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompstone"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thompstone for clarifying that.

My concern is that when an airline is not based in Shannon, we are depending on flights coming elsewhere.  If a flight goes technical out of Dublin first thing in the morning, then we are goosed.

As the Chairman and other members know, there is significant engagement with Shannon Chamber, the Irish Hotels Federation and all who hold Shannon close to their hearts and have concern for the airport.  Far more happens beyond the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.<\/p> <p>  I have read Mr. Thompstone's document, which was already presented to us in the county some weeks ago.  What is proposed is very innovative.  Three countries, Spain, Denmark and Cyprus, have operated schemes along the lines of the suggested traffic recovery support scheme.  Mr. Thompstone is correct to say that this money will recirculate in the economy because landing planes on the tarmac in Shannon means that the passengers they carry will exit the airport and, invariably, spend their money in local shops and restaurants.  They sleep overnight in local hotels.  The economy is cyclical.  The money comes back in and goes around.  It is similar to the way people said the construction industry works in that 70% of the money circulates right back through the economy again and everything comes full circle.<\/p> <p>  Intervening in Shannon has effects throughout the region.  The two are interlinked.  They are cogs of a wheel going in the same direction.  The economy in our region lives and dies in Shannon.  I do not use the word \"dies\" in a pessimistic way.  They are so symbiotically linked such that if one is damaged, the other also gets damaged.  The proposed scheme is very innovative.  It would involve a sliding scale that would take account of where figures are on a seasonal basis and thereby would allow the Exchequer to adjust.  That is a point I have been making to my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  This intervention can absolutely work.  The document is self-explanatory.<\/p> <p>  I want to change my questioning somewhat.  I commend the witnesses before us.  Two and a half years ago, they came forward with a document to reinvigorate Shannon Airport and air connectivity into an out of the mid-west.  I refer to the report compiled by Copenhagen Economics and commissioned jointly by the chambers of commerce in the mid-west.  It was issued at a time when Shannon was faltering and trudging along because it was competing against Dublin.  Things were not very rosy.  However, this document has a new sparkle to it because it is very relevant as we get beyond 19 July and as we look towards summer scheduling and, moreover, a recovery.<\/p> <p>  This needs to be looked at in tandem with a capital expenditure, capex, per passenger intervention involving a capping of the number of passengers who can land at the capital's airport.  Before people in Dublin start jumping on Twitter, I am not looking to shut Dublin down.  This works very successfully in the Netherlands where there is an annual cap of 500,000 flights into that nation's capital airport.  That has resulted in many airlines using the airports in Eindhoven, Rotterdam and The Hague.  It has driven far more traffic and given rise to a 6% to 10% boost in air travel via those airports.  That was one of the recommendations from a year and a half or two years ago.  Does Mr. Thompstone believe that is still in the mix?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#L00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":763,"content":"<p>The Copenhagen Economics report, as it is now known, was led by Limerick Chamber with the support of the other chambers, the very same group that is involved here today.  It is indicative of how important chamber members regard connectivity through airports in the regions.  Every argument I am making here today applies equally to Cork Airport as it does to Shannon or any other airport in the western region.  The Copenhagen report highlighted that very few if any countries in Europe or the rest of the world have the level of concentration of air traffic that Ireland has on Dublin with over 90%.  In February, the Government announced the route incentive scheme which was very welcome.  It provided &euro;26 million of which &euro;20 million was for Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.  As the incentive scheme is based on 2019 levels of traffic, by definition most of it will go to Dublin Airport.  We need a strong capital city and we need a strong Dublin Airport, but we also need strong regional connectivity.  Our issue is with the level of concentration in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  The rationale for either capping or incentivising more traffic into Cork and Shannon is to reduce the level of congestion.  One of the things we have learned from the Covid pandemic is that there is a significant premium on space - space around people and ability to move into and out of an airport quickly.  We can contribute to the Covid solution by bringing more traffic into Cork and Shannon airports.  It is not an either-or in that sense.  It is not about equity.  It is about coming up with something that is sensible for our economy, for our country and for our people.<\/p> <p>  This comes back to the argument for intervention.  If we do nothing and just leave it to the market forces, then the Copenhagen Economics people will be back in two, three, four or five years' time and that number will be 99%, which would not be good for the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompstone"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":764,"content":"<p>One of the eye-openers of the past 18 months has been the minuscule level of air cargo into and out of Shannon Airport.

I thank the members for this opportunity to speak with them.  We appreciate their time and interest.  With respect to Covid, ours is a decimated industry that operates in a symbiotic relationship with aviation.  We ran at a level of 30% of our overall revenue last year.  We have had five months of closure.  We are taking baby steps into recovery as part of the quasi reopening we have in so far as we are open to residents only or for outdoor service.  To give members an indication of the summer months, what would be considered the peak season of June, July and August, hotel occupancy in Limerick city is running at 16%.  Essentially, that means only one out of every ten bedrooms is occupied.  Ours is the worst performing region in the country despite all the fantastic amenities we have.  It was great to see F&aacute;ilte Ireland's development plan launched this week.  <\/p> <p>  In essence, hotels across the country, in the main, are only existing because of the life support they have been on from the Government perspective.  The outlook is poor.  We could not be confident about it, particularly in the context of international travel.  There is some uncertainty about the sector reopening on 19 July.  If the reopening goes ahead, and everybody hopes it will, we also hope public health plans will progress, but what will that look like for the sector?  We are cognisant a number of southern European countries, in particular, announced very early when they would reopen.  They have made some progress ahead of us.  There is also a sense of progress markers.  At what points will we see changes in that respect?<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Thompstone mentioned, our tourism industry is worth &euro;9 billion.  Some &euro;7 billion odd of that comes from overseas and less than &euro;2 billion comes from the domestic market.  Irish people have been fantastic in supporting hotels across the country last year when they could but Covid has had a major impact.  During the worst period of the pandemic in our 270,000 job-strong tourism industry, some 160,000 jobs were lost.<\/p> <p>  In the areas represented by the Shannon, Limerick, Clare and Galway chambers, 50,000 jobs in the tourism sector alone would fall within those areas.  If we were to extend that along the western seaboard and take into the consideration the other regional airports, for which the case is also being made today, we would be talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Tourism represents one in ten of all jobs in Ireland and 70% of those tourism jobs are outside Dublin.  As many members know from their constituencies, sometimes tourism is the only show in town.  It has a significant impact on suppliers and the retail sector.  When we had the first lockdown, in my home village of Adare, the shops closed very soon after the hotels just before the lockdown.  They are very interlinked.  That is the reality of it.  Reference was made to the business community and foreign direct investment.  We cannot exist without it.  Regional airports such as Shannon, Cork and the others are the lifeline to the area.  We are really feeling the hit.<\/p><p>To answer the question regarding doubling the tourism marketing fund, that was something suggested initially as part of the tourism recovery task force, of which I was a member.  To give an idea of its scale, in previous times, every euro Tourism Ireland spent on overseas marketing led to &euro;130 in tourism revenues.  If that ratio of 130:1 is not return enough, it tells its own story in terms of the ability of tourism to contribute.  Prior to Covid, tourism contributed &euro;2 billion per annum to the Exchequer.  We believe the impact of tourism is critical in terms of supporting Shannon.  The Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, has suggested, as has Mr. Thompstone in his report, that recovery may not come until 2024 and as an island nation, we have a lot more to do, particularly given that the restrictions have been a bit tougher than what was experienced across Europe.  Particularly from a regional perspective, this is a really proactive approach.  It is three-pronged and looks at multi-year capex.  As Mr. Thompstone mentioned earlier, airlines simply have no income.  It also looks at the doubling of the Tourism Ireland marketing fund and an industry activation fund because one cannot exist without the other.  The last piece is the TRSS.  The merits of it speak for themselves.  The impact of the visitors to the area, not to mention the business community, is the glue that ties our whole region together.  The committee will see a similar glue in the other regional airports as well.  Hopefully, that answers the Chairman's question.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#M01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaina Fitzgerald Kane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which were clear and easily understood.

It deserves moral and practical support and I have no doubt the committee will endorse the report, put its authority behind it and seek Government intervention, as outlined in the report.<\/p> <p>  We mentioned Clare, Limerick and Galway.  It is also important to remember that Shannon is of significant importance to Tipperary, an area I represent, and north Tipperary in particular.  A large number of our people work in Shannon or rely on the Shannon hub for connectivity.  In particular, Lough Derg and our tourism sector feed off Shannon Airport and the Shannon region.  Many involved in our business sector rely on connectivity through Shannon to run their enterprises properly.  I listened to the T&aacute;naiste last week in the D&aacute;il put forward a suggestion that we should promote Shannon as a cargo hub.  This indicates that there is Government support for that initiative and the witnesses should pursue this in a more formal manner and possibly make a business plan for that particular project within the business plan.

I support everything the witnesses are trying to do.  I would sound a note of caution.  I live in Dublin now instead of Galway.  Many people on this side of the country are asking what is the big issue as with motorways nowadays, one can be in Dublin within an hour and a half, two hours or whatever.  Consequently, they think there is no great need for the regional airports or the emphasis on them.  I ask the witnesses to look for additional funding for marketing, particularly for Shannon and Cork airports.  I will not talk too much about Cork too much because I do not know as much about it as some of those present.  I first flew from Shannon in 1968 to London as a boy and have great memories of that airport.<\/p> <p>  I have significant concern about the negative press relating to Shannon because of flights by US forces.  I want to put on the record that nothing illegal is happening.  Those aircraft are flying in under UN chapter and are perfectly legal.

My questions may touch on issues raised previously.  I will start with the recent announcement by Aer Lingus and the closure of its cabin crew base.  In light of the fact that there has been no commitment to resume the vital Heathrow route, could the witnesses comment on the direct and indirect knock-on effects on tourism and hospitality business owners in the region they have seen or that have been relayed to them?  No conclusions have been drawn on the back of numerous reviews and reports and task force recommendations have not been implemented by the Department of Transport.  Therefore, very little action has been taken.  How has this affected confidence in the region?  This is something with which I am particularly concerned.<\/p> <p>  What does Shannon Chamber anticipate with regard to the strategic review of Lufthansa and will this result in its closure?  Do the witnesses think that Shannon Group should intervene to prevent further decline in the aviation industry base at Shannon?  Do the witnesses anticipate a decrease in foreign direct investment in Shannon if connectivity continues at its current rate?  To date, has the Government committed to or considered a capital investment scheme such as the witnesses' proposal of the TRSS?  Has the Government engaged with Shannon Chamber and taken on board the measures outlined in detail in the presentation to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, several months ago?  <\/p> <p>  I will touch on something mentioned in the witnesses' responses.  They spoke about Spain being an example of best practice or a country that has modelled their TRS scheme.  In light of this, can the witnesses give us an example of what Spain has provided for regional airports akin to Shannon?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#N00400","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their support for the proposal, which is very much appreciated.  In response to Deputy Wynne's questions, I would always be a glass half-full person.  One of the things I can say about aviation over the years having worked in economic development and in aviation, particularly in Shannon and around the area over many years, is that it is a cyclical business and there will be ups and downs.  Aviation is clearly in a down phase at present.  The airline industry and the wider aviation sector are impacted, which is why we are talking about Lufthansa Technik doing a review of its operations.  I have been around and have seen a lot of those in the past.  Many of the businesses that are there today have been through multiple ownerships but the one success we always have in Shannon is reinventing to deal with whatever issues are thrown at us from the marketplace.<\/p><p>I would be very confident about Shannon's future from that point of view.<\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, the Aer Lingus decision on the cabin crew base in Shannon is regrettable, particularly from the point of view of the people working there who are directly affected and their families.  At the same time, though, I would be confident that we will see Aer Lingus flying into Shannon again.  The question is when.  Hopefully, it will be sooner rather than later.  I would be confident because, as Ms Fitzgerald Kane mentioned earlier, right up and down the Wild Atlantic Way, we have a superb tourism project.  We know there is pent-up demand around the world for that.  With Tourism Ireland getting the marketing funding we are proposing on the back of previous task force recommendations, we believe the message will go out to the world that Ireland is open for business.<\/p><p> If we can back that up with the route incentive scheme we are proposing today, there will be a market for the future.  The same also applies to foreign direct investment.  We have blue-chip companies, most of them run by Irish people, regardless of where the ownership is, up and down the Atlantic economic corridor, whether it is in Castlebar, Galway, Ennis, Shannon, Limerick or Cork.  We have a strong base there and we have good, practical Irish and non-Irish people working in those businesses.  They will push, as they have always done, to make sure those businesses succeed.<\/p><p> That brings us all the way back to the reason we are here today, which is that governments intervene when there is market failure.  We clearly have market failure now.  Our recommendation is to intervene for a defined period during the recovery to enable that critical mass we have, be it in tourism, hospitality, leisure, manufacturing or the international service industry to realise its potential, as we have shown in the past.  If the Government does that, it will get the payback as our numbers have shown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompstone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":793,"content":"<p>We will now move to Senator Buttimer, who has four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021062300002#O00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I will not use the four minutes.

I am in a hotel in Dublin right now as a guest.  The doors are locked for people who are not staying in the hotel.  Some hotels have such a close link with their communities.  When they cannot provide indoor dining, it is a huge part of their business.  Not being able to reopen at a fuller scale or a restricted version of a fuller scale will have a huge impact on businesses, teams and communities.  It is untenable and, in some cases, businesses have not been open for 16 months.<\/p> <p>  One of the points I will make is that we as hoteliers, and I am sure I can say this on behalf of all the tourism community, cannot wait for the point where we are not dependent on supports, which we are.  They are so welcome, particularly now as we are trying to recruit people and retrain them.  It is like starting all over again but the notion of not being able to proceed to the next level would have a hugely devastating effect.  It is across all elements of one's business, whether it is indoor dining or weddings with a couple whose hopes and dreams have been put on hold.  Any threat to international travel is untenable given the fact that other countries are open and have more clarity around their lead time and what it will look like.  As an island nation, with &euro;9 billion in tourism revenue and &euro;7 billion of that coming from overseas, any further threat to that is just untenable.  It is something I do not want to think about.  It will make the road to recovery so much more difficult than it already is.  That is 270,000 livelihoods in terms of tourism, not to mention the other people who are affected.  We have seen that it is catastrophic.<\/p> <p>  In the context of Government, we often hear the sector was the first and hardest hit but the last to recover.  That is the difficult bit and that is where we need the most help.  We are very thankful for what has been put in place.
