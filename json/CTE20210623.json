Apart from me and the members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely.  All members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senators Garvey and Gavan.<\/p> <p>  Today, we will give consideration to facilitating the reactivation of enterprise, trade and employment following the pandemic restrictions.  The committee will be assisted by representatives of the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  Members will recall that last week the committee considered a similar issue with representatives from Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, ISME, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.<\/p> <p>  From the County and City Management Association, I am pleased to welcome Ms AnnMarie Farrelly, chief executive of Fingal County Council and chair of the CCMA business, enterprise, innovation and urban-town economic renewal committee.  I also welcome Dr. Pat Daly, who I know well, chief executive of Limerick City and County Council; Ms Anna Marie Delaney, chief executive of Offaly County Council; Mr. Richard Shakespeare, assistant chief executive of Dublin City Council; and Mr. Padraic McElwee, chair of the local enterprise office, LEO, network and head of LEO from Clare County Council.<\/p> <p>  Before we proceed, I must outline some issues around parliamentary privilege.  I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Evidence given by witnesses physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If a witness's statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  To commence our consideration of the matter before us, I invite Ms Farrelly to make her opening remarks on behalf of the County and City Management Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":6,"content":"<p>On behalf of the CCMA, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to present on the role of local government in the reactivation of enterprise, trade and employment following the pandemic restrictions.  I am the chief executive of Fingal County Council and chair of the CCMA business, enterprise, innovation and urban-town economic renewal committee.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Dr. Pat Daly, Ms Anna Marie Delaney, Mr. Richard Shakespeare and Mr. Padraic McElwee.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities provided a range of social and economic supports throughout the pandemic appropriate to the level of restriction in place for the economic sectors and across our communities.  The roll-out of supports was implemented with pace, agility and efficiency with the aim of maintaining as much business confidence as possible during this time of unprecedented economic and societal change.<\/p> <p>  The following supports are managed directly by local authorities: 107 urban regeneration and development projects approved to a value of &euro;1.6 billion; 164 rural regeneration development projects approved to a value of &euro;338 million; &euro;633 million paid to 108,000 businesses through the restart and restart plus grants in 2020; &euro;1.2 billion of rates waivers processed, with the waiver continuing for quarter 3; &euro;85 million in direct funding to local businesses, including &euro;38 million for online trading to 16,000 businesses; &euro;60 million in funding provided for the small business assistance scheme; more than 22,000 businesses supported with one-to-one mentoring through the local enterprise offices: and the participation of almost 110,000 people in upskilling training events organised by the local enterprise offices.  There are now 35,000 jobs in 7,500 LEO-supported client companies.  In excess of 20,000 outdoor dining spaces have been facilitated for the hospitality sector on the public realm.  This includes local authority provision of more than 1,000 parklets and caf&eacute;-style options for business.  More than 1,000 hospitality businesses have also benefited from in excess of &euro;4 million in outdoor dining grants so far.  Almost 3,000 new benches and public seats have been provided.  Greatly enhanced litter prevention and cleansing regimes are in place.<\/p> <p>  As has been demonstrated, local authorities play a key role in the democratic, social, economic and cultural development of local areas.  City and county councils across Ireland provide infrastructure, amenities and services designed to improve local areas as places to live, visit and invest.  From an economic perspective, local authorities play a critical role in putting in place initiatives to stimulate the local economy and to support business in creating employment.  Never has this role been more critical than in the past 16 months.  Local authorities work closely and in partnership with Departments and key State agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Arts Council, and on a local level with chambers of commerce and business representative bodies.  This collaborative and partnership approach has been essential to navigating the challenges faced by business due to the impact of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The community call was one such action-led programme to provide services to vulnerable individuals during the Covid-19 lockdown.  Co-ordination at local level by the local authorities was critical and the sector immediately responded to the call to mobilise community networks across the State over the space of a single weekend.  At a local level, local authorities established a local authority response forum, which co-ordinated the work of the community call.<\/p><p>This involved frequent engagement through the national oversight group which included CCMA representation in its membership. <br\/><br\/>The local enterprise offices play a key role and are an integral part of each local authority, supporting start-up businesses, entrepreneurs and in general assisting businesses to scale up, innovate and develop their market potential.  Local enterprise offices, LEOs, are recognised as a one-stop shop, providing enterprise advice, coaching, management development and expertise.  The financial supports available through the LEO network have proven to be a critical contributory factor in the success story of many of Ireland&rsquo;s high performing start-ups.  It has been widely recognised that in the face of unprecedented challenge, the LEOs managed to pivot and adapt quickly to assist businesses to endure the crisis of the pandemic. <br\/><br\/>In addition, local authorities play a pivotal role in supporting tourism and the development of destinations and attractions throughout the country.  Working in collaboration and partnership with the national tourism authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, tourism task forces have been established across the sector.  The tourism industry has been one of the most affected industries by the pandemic.  The impact on a national, regional and local level has decimated the industry.  However, throughout this time, local authorities have been active and responsive in ensuring tourism on a local, regional and national level will survive and build back stronger. <br\/><br\/>Local authorities have also been instrumental in the provision of enterprise hubs.  A national digital hub network<b><\/b>of 400<b><\/b>digital hubs is now established, providing 15,000 workspaces and 270 broadband connection points.  Wifi4EU schemes are also being rolled out nationally.  All of these services are integral to future remote workings strategies.  The Look for Local and staycation tourism campaigns had significant success in 2020.  Further campaigns for summer 2021 are under way.  More than 4,500 local companies have participated in the Look for Local campaign which covered every business sector throughout the country. <br\/><br\/>Local authorities continue to lead, deliver and finance city and town centre rejuvenation projects, economic activations and other direct business supports in line with the following Government initiatives: the urban regeneration and development fund; the rural regeneration development fund; the town and village renewal scheme 2021; the walking and cycling infrastructure programme; the rural active travel investment programme; the Creative Ireland programme; the reimagining outdoor spaces fund; the outdoor seating and accessories fund; the outdoor dining enhancement scheme; the local live performance scheme; the local authorities urban animation capital infrastructure scheme; the creative climate action fund; the enhanced litter prevention and cleaning programmes to support outdoor summer 2021; and the community enhancement programme.<br\/><br\/>The projects include large-scale urban regeneration investments and town centre public realm improvements and revitalisation projects.  Town and city recovery task forces have been established to work in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Licensed Vintners Association, Retail Excellence, chambers of commerce, local business improvement district, BID, companies and other relevant stakeholders.  Dublin, Cork and Limerick city councils, along with most other local authorities, have been very active in this regard and further information is provided in our submission.<br\/><br\/>The restrictions on travel and the reduction in the capacity of public transport accentuated the necessity to accelerate active travel initiatives in cities, towns and local areas throughout Ireland.  Local authorities implemented and continue to implement a series of measures to support walking and cycling.  Active travel measures being delivered by local authorities primarily involve the improvement and expansion of cycling and walking infrastructure.  These measures were supplemented by a suite of supports designed to enhance the safety, security and comfort of cyclists and pedestrians, such as the pedestrianisation of streets, installation of benches and parklets to accommodate rest, segregation of cycle lanes and roadways, provision of quiet spaces and installation of temporary and permanent toilets.<br\/><br\/>In addition to facilitating mobility, these active travel measures play an important role in supporting the physical and mental well-being of people through the pandemic.  These measures also helped foster a greater appreciation of the natural and built heritage of local areas, while connecting local communities.  The CCMA acknowledges the considerable support of the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority which have committed &euro;393 million investment for multi-annual active travel plans, with more anticipated.  The roll-out of this is supported by creation of 248 active travel posts.  Local authorities will play a key role in achieving the Government&rsquo;s objective of delivering 1,000 km of cycling and walking infrastructure by 2025.<br\/><br\/>Local government economic plans for the coming months will build on our efforts over the past 16 months.  In November 2020, a framework for development of local economic sustainability initiatives was developed by the local government sector.  The framework was centred on significant measures and activities that were under way across the sector to support businesses at this critical time.  Over the coming weeks and months, a robust suite of initiatives will underpin economic growth at local level and provide confidence for communities, as we move forward into a period of rebuilding.  Local authorities are committed to supporting and facilitating an agile and appropriate response to business and community needs, working collaboratively with business communities and representative groups throughout the country.  New regional enterprise plans are now being developed to encourage development of new and existing businesses and to increase employment in every region.  Local authorities are a key partner in this process. <br\/><br\/>The CCMA and the local government sector acknowledge the extensive and far-reaching support provided by Government during the pandemic crisis and on a continuing basis.  Local authorities have and will continue to respond to the needs of their local areas, assist business recovery and help get people back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms AnnMarie Farrelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The members will have received a submission which they have read.

It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that Ms Farrelly from my area is here.  I thank her for being here and for all of the work she and her team have done throughout Covid-19.  I have written to her about this as well.  It has been outstanding.  Notwithstanding the challenges faced at every turn, the staff of Fingal County Council have been first-class in terms of the service provision, etc.  I would be grateful if Ms Farrelly would pass that on to the staff.<\/p> <p>  We cannot ignore the elephant in the room which is the recent issue raised by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, some members of local authorities and myself last night on the floor of the D&aacute;il, with regard to consumption of alcohol outdoors.  I do not believe any person in government, when he or she said we would have an outdoor summer, meant we would solely and only be consuming alcohol outdoors, but I also do not believe any person who said it could be ignorant of the fact consumption of alcohol will form part of the summer outdoors for some people.<\/p> <p>  I will be straight with Ms Farrelly.  It does not seem sufficient preparation was put in place.  I say that because last night, when I was on my feet in the D&aacute;il Chamber, the Minister of State read out a script on behalf of the Minister for Justice that was contradicted by a statement issued previously to the media.  The Minister for Justice has now indicated she will be drafting primary legislation to ensure people can stay within the confines of the rules and use the outdoor seating, whether that be for eating or consumption of alcohol.<\/p> <p>  That is regrettable.  It sends a poor message to businesses that are struggling.  Many of them in my area are counting the days until indoor dining reopens.  In the meantime, all they have is takeaway and outdoor dining and this has thrown a spanner in the works.  If you talk to local businesses, which I know Ms Farrelly does, they will tell you this is the last thing they need.  If you talk to the workers who are working in these local businesses, they will tell you that uncertainty over their employment is the last thing they need.<\/p> <p>  My questions are fairly simple.  Can Ms Farrelly say, with confidence, to those businesses that are operating outdoor seating for eating, drinking or both that they can continue?<\/p><p>Does she believe the primary legislation is necessary?  Can she detail what consultation took place because for my part, it does not seem like there was sufficient consultation?  If there had been, these issues would not have arisen.  What level of consultation was there with the Government in establishing what the legal position was locally?  That does not seem to have been done and it seems to be different from area to area.  It is really disappointing.<\/p><p> Can Ms Farrelly provide her views on the primary legislation and on the level of consultation?  If I were to have a pint next Friday in one of the many parklets provided by Fingal County Council outside one of the many lovely establishments in Skerries, where I live, would I be within the confines of the law?  Does she think the primary legislation is necessary or does she believe businesses can continue to trade?  Advising members of the Garda to use their discretion is not a good policy.  The Garda does not want to do that as it puts its members in a poor position.  Business owners and workers are concerned that it puts them in an unstable and precarious position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#B00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I might ask some of my colleagues to supplement anything I say here.  I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her compliments with regard to the county of Fingal.  Great efforts have been made across the country in every local authority to make sure we could get ready for the congregation that has happened as a result of the lack of indoor space.  Much of what has happened in our counties is because of the need for people to congregate outdoors.  We have been getting ready for the outdoor summer, including the provision of parklets, as referred to by Deputy O'Reilly, and outdoor space.<\/p> <p>  I can speak for most local authorities insofar as saying that usually, the local authority by-laws apply and prohibit drinking in public places.  However, where licences have been provided under section 254 of the Planning and Development Act, the alcohol by-laws do not apply to those areas.  Deputy O'Reilly is correct in saying that when I mentioned 20,000 outdoor spaces, a substantial majority of those areas have been provided to coffee shops and other dining areas where alcohol is not an issue and that should be taken into account.  Many restaurants and public houses are using their own private space for the outdoor summer.  Some have been supplemented by the outdoor parklets.<\/p> <p>  There was a lot of consultation in relation to the grants for outdoor dining, to help businesses purchase furniture for their private space and the public areas.  It is clear that local authorities are responsible for the public realm and policing of people is a matter for the Garda.  At a local level, in Fingal, there have been many conversations with the local garda&iacute;, and we worked together.  There is no doubt that the provision and the reopening of businesses, albeit with outdoor space, has greatly assisted the issue of people congregating.  As an example, in Deputy O'Reilly's own town, it was mentioned to me recently that there are as many as 2,000 seats available in the private outdoor spaces of local bars and restaurants.  Those 2,000 people were more than likely in the public area up until the bank holiday weekend in June.  That has, therefore, greatly helped maintain the safety of our towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  The discretion seems to be necessary.  Insofar as a precise interpretation of the legislation is concerned, none of our public space provision ameliorates against provisions in the licence for the public house or restaurant and that needs to be taken into account.  I understand the point of sale of alcohol is a consideration as well.  Ultimately, however, I am in members' hands as to whether further legal provision needs to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms AnnMarie Farrelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>That is the point I take issue with.

Let us bear in mind, shortly before said she was going to bring forward primary legislation, she was tweeting that it was not necessary.  This kind of shambolic carry-on is driving business owners and workers up the wall.  My time is limited so I want to be very clear.  Is Ms Farrelly confident that without primary legislation, people can serve alcohol, not in their own private spaces because I know that is covered by section 254, but in the public realm?  Is she confident that without having to exercise discretion, members of the Garda can leave people alone so long as there are no public order incidents and that the people in Skerries, Balbriggan, Swords, Rush, Lusk or wherever they happen to be can have a glass of wine with their pizza or a pint or whatever in the public spaces specifically?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#C00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am not in a position to advise Deputy O'Reilly on the individual licence criteria of businesses.

The impression that has gone out is that the people who control the car parks control the pedestrianisation, which is bonkers because the people who control the car parks clearly have an interest that is entirely at odds with the goal of pedestrianisation.  I would appreciate it were Mr. Shakespeare, particularly because he is here representing Dublin City Council, to respond to that.  It seems that the partial pedestrianisation has worked.

For the vast majority of people there, notwithstanding some messing, it was a very enjoyable experience.  People say that it is great and that it would be great if it were bigger.

I am in the happy position that both Ms Farrelly and Mr. Shakespeare cover my constituency.  I have a couple of questions.  I am interested in the council officials' view of town centre reinvention following the impact of the pandemic.  One certainly gets the impression the shift away from retail to online has dramatically accelerated.  I wonder what will be the permanent impact on town centres.  As a group, are the officials changing their strategy with respect to town centres, particularly regarding residential living within towns?  I saw data on the use of the local authority scheme for reviving derelict properties.  Waterford, which is just one city, was using 45%.  There appear to be opportunities on that front.  Is there a new approach in this regard?  The officials are now recasting both enterprise plans and development plans.  Will we see a new approach to town centre reinvention?  Ms Farrelly rightly quoted many schemes out there including, creative, public realm, cycling renewal and community schemes.  There is a need to inject within individual selected towns some methodology for pulling people together to frame a comprehensive plan and I am interested in that.<\/p> <p>  As for the long-term impact of the pandemic, the second item I am interested in is the development of remote working outside the major cities.  To what extent are local authorities looking at the potential of hubs to copper-fasten that development?  Alternatively, do the officials think this is likely to be a fairly temporary phenomenon that will not call for very significant change in infrastructure?<\/p> <p>  Obviously housing is on the minds of most people and while the building of social homes was allowed to continue through the pandemic, I am sure it was considerably interfered with, and private housebuilding came to a standstill.  How are local authorities approaching the issue of getting that back on track as quickly as possible, because there is such pressure in the housing area?<\/p> <p>  As we exit this pandemic, there are bound to be many businesses under considerable pressure.  Have the councils been looking at how they are going to look at outstanding rates bills - although I am aware they did not apply during the Covid period - or how they might manage the problems of essentially viable businesses with short-term problems?  In some cases, those businesses may be tenants of the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I have a question for Ms Delaney of Offaly County Council.  What perception does she have at this point of the progress on just transition?  Covid has no doubt dealt a blow to many of the projects that were hopefully coming on stream.  I would be interested to hear her view on where we stand with that and whether it can be accelerated in its impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#D00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will come in quickly on the town centre approach and how we might reinvent some of our town centres.  Certainly the town centres first initiative coming from Government is something on which we are working very closely with it.  It is about living and working in town centres.  The remote working opportunities may help reinvigorate some town centres and bring back more employment.  Local authorities are looking at that quite closely.  There is no doubt we need to work with all the stakeholders in towns.  The principle of town teams is well accepted by ourselves and is in place in many towns across the country.  I take the Deputy's point on dereliction.  A combination of penalisation and incentives will get more activity into our town centres.  We are worried about retail.  However, some towns which are remote from city areas have done quite well during Covid and some of those areas have reinvented themselves.  This has not perhaps been the case with city centres across the country.  I will allow my colleagues from Limerick and Dublin city to come in on that.  On remote working, I mentioned the 400 digital hubs already established and the need for more.  It is not necessarily a rural issue alone.  The likes of the towns in north County Dublin would benefit greatly from remote working hubs.  Those towns have thrived somewhat during Covid as more people lived and worked in their local time as they were working from home.  I would like to capture some of that benefit and ensure we can keep it into the future.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt housing was delayed by the Covid restrictions earlier this year.  We are doing everything we can to get that impetus going again and it certainly started off quite quickly when the restrictions lifted.  We are all working to an agenda of activating more sites and getting more construction on the ground.  It is going to be a challenging year but we are all working to the one agenda and driving through progress where we can.  On the current rates waiver, I can only give the Fingal County Council experience but 40% of businesses benefit from the rates waiver at the moment in Fingal, so we are working quite closely with the other 60% on where they stand this year and whether they are in a position to pay the rates liability due.

We have seven of the eight national cultural institutions within Dublin and that is an area on which we will need to focus.  The question of what does city shopping offer people might be asked.  The retailers have been preparing for this online shift and all we can do is try to facilitate it by improving the experience in the public realm and how people experience their city.  In Dublin we have the living city initiative, which is encouraging people to live over the shop.  That is based a particular area in the city.  It relies on tax relief for individuals who own such properties to get them to build over the shop, as you might say, and get them to create those living spaces.

Our experience in Limerick city centre is similar to Dublin.  The market is changing and people&rsquo;s needs and wants from the city centre are changing, particularly around retail.  We are all aware that.  The experiential approach will to feature more.  We have been looking at this as part of the development plan process in Limerick.  We have looked at the retail strategy for the metro area.   That is common across authority areas in the country as they prepare the development plans.  It is about looking at how to animate that space much more, as well as at how it can trip into the night-time economy, so that there would not be two distinct phases of an experience in Limerick from the business side in the daytime, switching not very effectively into the night economy.  We have been asked to look deeply at that.<\/p> <p>  Revitalisation will be the carrot and stick approach, as Ms Farrelly mentioned.  We are using all our legislative bases to challenge people who are moving on or developing properties.  At the same time, we are gaining some success in Limerick on taking those back into ownership, changing them,  and offering them back to the market.  The owners are also stepping up to the plate and doing things.  The Living City Initiative was mentioned.  We are having some success in Limerick, which is a Georgian city.  The scheme is dedicated to older buildings.  Georgian buildings, in particular, are costly.  The grant level may need to change or to be looked at.  Broadly, it has the potential to be successful, but it may need some tweaking.  We will probably engage with the committee on that later.  However, it has potential and it would give people an impetus to develop, if either the grant or the percentage level on a tax base, were tweaked. <\/p> <p>  When people could only walk within a 3 km, 5 km, or 10 km limit, they engaged with their places.  Place-making, as well as where retail animation is within that place-making, will feature heavily.  I found it interesting - colleagues might share my view - that the engagement with trade and stakeholders has been active.  People have taken much more interest in what they are trying to achieve, and in what they want from their cities and counties.  That will feature heavily and the dialogue has been enriched.  It should feature heavily in the development plan process going forward.

I thank Deputy Bruton for his question and for his support previously at the commencement of the regional transition team process and its activation.  On the just transition process itself, progress has been slow.  That would be the perception of progress, both locally and throughout the region.  However, there have been significant activities around the just transition process.  We got engagement with the start team at EU level.  It engaged with communities locally.  There have been a number of recommendations and an action plan going forward to address some of those communities that are most impacted.  With regard to the just transition fund, it supports projects across three specific priority areas, namely, enterprise and employment; training and upskilling; and community transitioning.  There are Strand 1 and Strand 2 projects.  Strand 1 is for those under &euro;100,000.  Of those projects, 16 are currently in contract.  They are delivering.  The total value of those is &euro;1.2 million.  As reported under those 16 project plans, they will create 28 direct jobs and 175 indirect jobs.<\/p> <p>  Provisional offers were then made to 47 Strand 2 projects, which are those up to &euro;1 million.  All have undergone state aid assessment, etc.  It is a significant verification process.  There many hurdles for those projects to get over in that verification process.  However, at this stage, approximately 30% of those applications are in contract.  Work is ongoing with Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to get the rest of them over the line.  They are at varying stages of that process.  Some &euro;27 million was committed overall.  We do not know if all that will be drawn down.  We are seeking assurances on that and on what will happen to funds that are not drawn down.<\/p> <p>  The EU territorial plan is being prepared by the Department for submission.  That will go to Brussels for ratification.  There is &euro;77 million in that just transition fund allocated to Ireland.  With match funding and national funding, I think that brings it up &euro;150 million.  We ask that that will go to those communities that are most impacted.  We look forward to working with the Department further on that.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at the administration of funds in Offaly.  We are working with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to see if Offaly County Council can administer those funds to enable them to be rolled-out to those communities more quickly.  It has been approximately 12 months since applications were made.  It has been six months since the announcement of the successful projects.  This is a obviously significant issue for communities that have made applications, particularly in getting their match funding.  They have not been able to do local fundraising due to Covid-19.  There is, therefore, a match funding issue for a number of those.   We have been asking our Deputies and MEPs to look at that.  We have had a couple of meetings with MEPs in relation to the NUTS 3 region and the EU territorial plan.  These are progressing, but progress is slow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Marie Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Paul Murphy, who has seven minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#E00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.

Does that cause Limerick City and County Council to alter any of its existing plans?

We have kept in close contact with both the indigenous and the foreign direct investment markets to see what the trends were.  Their view is that the office market will maintain and that there is a role for the market and the office.  They believe that people may do transactional work at home and that where people are transacting or processing work, they may do part of that at remote locations.  However, for creativity, teamwork and strategising, people will still need spaces and offices.  The inside of the office may reconfigure but the pattern of office development or the need for offices will not change.  We are seeing that there is still a healthy pipeline in Limerick and we are still getting a lot of interest because the cost base is right.<\/p> <p>  We are benefiting from remote working in the sense that, through technology, people are beginning to relocate to Limerick or the mid-west to work.

I will speak about the living city initiative.  I am interested in hearing comments from Mr. Shakespeare but not about Dublin, which has been well covered this morning.  I am thinking more about my city of Waterford.  We are probably following the same narrative as other cities at the moment in trying to develop remote working opportunities, seeking to expand digital hubs and, hopefully, retain some of the outdoor amenity space we are developing, as well as developing public transport, access and all of that.  I agree with what Ms Farrelly said.  Much of this is predicated on jobs.  It is basically a chicken and egg situation.  If a place is not invested in, how can economic activity be created to drive job creation within it?<\/p> <p>  The living city initiative is not working in Waterford.  The reason for this is largely economic but we also have many old, listed buildings.  There is no benefit in giving property owners a tax break because there is no money to be made out of it in terms of a rental yield.  The question is how we get these properties back into use.  There are two hotels in Waterford at the moment, both of which are derelict.  The property owners are sitting on them and waiting for a market bounce.  In one case in particular, the economic tide has turned and one would imagine the owners would get going but the properties are sitting there despite dereliction notices and so on, which are not having the desired effect.

Limerick is akin to Waterford in size and scale.  To add to what Mr. Shakespeare said, we could look to the blending of a conversion to a grant or a raise, or look at the time period of the building and the percentage of the tax allowance.  We have had good dialogue and have gone door-to-door with our conservation and architectural teams, and talked and walked with the owners to challenge them to do more.  It has resulted in 20 or 25 buildings coming back into the market, either being redeveloped or being brought for sale to the market.  I can understand there is a great fear of using the scheme among some owners, developers, potential investors and even homeowners, which is that when they get into conservation of these old Georgian buildings, it will just be an open-ended bill.  We have been able to guide it very heavily, as Mr. Shakespeare has said.  We have been able to talk to property owners and, hopefully, give them some assurances.  We have given them design templates to help them.<\/p> <p>  When we started that process and dialogue it helped things along.  We were not the big, scary place where people felt they would just end up with a lot of costs, bills and regulation.  We turned it on its head and said to property owners that these are very important buildings that are part of our urban architecture and history and we wanted to work with them on it.  That kind of carrot approach has been better than the stick in this instance.

Its excellent report, The Future Development of Limerick City, painted a really positive picture of transforming Limerick into an urban environment where significantly higher numbers of individuals live in the city and others are attracted to visit and to participate in cultural, hospitality, educational and other activities.  It estimated that we would need 1,100 additional homes in the city each year.  I want to revisit the issue of the Opera Centre in that context.  The word \"balance\" has been mentioned.  I think we all agree that we have to get the balance right.

I will pass them on to my colleagues.  The chamber of commerce report, which was prepared by Indecon Consultants, was very useful as an insight into how they see the world, as an analysis of how Limerick might emerge and develop and as an input into the draft development plan for Limerick.  It identified that urban living, particularly in the city centre, needs to come up a level at pace.  We would agree with that and we are working through it.<\/p> <p>  For the benefit of other members of the committee, the Opera Centre site is a large 4-hectare site in the middle of the city that we are bringing forward.  We have a development company in Limerick called Limerick 2030 DAC.  It is probably Ireland's only public interest development company.  It is taking forward key sites that we felt would anchor the redevelopment and revitalisation of Limerick city centre.  We are now looking at other locations around the county as well.  The site will be mixed use.  It will primarily have public spaces.  In addition to a new building for Revenue, which is expanding in Limerick, there will be a new library centre, an innovation office block, an aparthotel, some retail, a neighbourhood centre and some limited residential development, involving the conversion of a Georgian area.<\/p> <p>  That is only one site and there are many others we are working through.  A great deal of attention has been paid to the mixed-use aspect of the Opera Centre site.  Much of it is under negotiation which I probably cannot get into.  We have nearly all the blocks in dialogue with possible investors and owners.  Work is continuing on other key sites around the city centre, some of which are in our ownership and some of which we are working on with the private sector, to bring forward apartment living and social, affordable and student schemes.  I acknowledge that we have lacked such schemes in Limerick.  Our planning has not been confined to the Indecon report, on which we worked very closely with the chamber of commerce, with which we have a strong relationship as a stakeholder.  We have also worked with KPMG Future Analytics on our own reporting as part of the development plan process.<\/p> <p>  On an economic and spatial basis, we are asking what else is needed and how the mix works.  We probably need seven or eight new sites that would have social and affordable aspects along with more commercial and residential aspects.  That is where the next phase of the plan will be.  We spoke earlier about animating the city centre, what the change in the mix of retail and living will be, and where the night economy meets that.  I think that will be the next phase for Limerick.  It is quite an exciting phase.  I think there is a lot of interest in the public consultation around the draft development plan.  That came through very clearly.  It is very interesting that both reports we have been working with have come up with that as a finding.  While I agree with what the Senator has said, it will be not be confined to the Opera Centre.  We are a long way down the road in the Opera Centre - on-site works are taking place and development agreements have almost been finalised on several of the key buildings.

As we want people to be more animated in the city centre and to come to the city, we will have to look at the provision of public toilets and facilities.

So many schemes have come through the county councils.  They have tried to get them out to businesses and communities as quickly as possible.  I am sure it has not been easy but it has been done very well.  Many rural towns in my own county of Tipperary, such as Cahir and Cashel, and around the country have been enhanced on the back of the outdoor dining scheme.

I refer to the relationship of local authorities with Irish Water.  It seems to me that the priorities of many local authorities within their county do not align with the priorities of Irish Water for the county.  Is that difficult to align?  Where do our guests see that going?   It seems to me that the priorities of local authorities relate to economic growth whereas those of Irish Water relate to environmental aspects.  We cannot attract people into rural Ireland, to counties such as Tipperary and elsewhere, unless Irish Water and local authorities are aligned.

What are their views in that regard internally going forward?  Those targets set down in the White Paper are quite ambitious.<\/p><p> Reference was made to remote working hubs.  It is really positive and very welcome.  I am a huge supporter of such hubs in County Tipperary.  It is all well and good to have remote working hubs in place, but there is a need for them to be managed.  What role can be played by local authorities in the management of remote working hubs?<\/p><p> Several speakers touched on rural regeneration and the amount of funding that has come through the rural regeneration and urban regeneration funds.  Obviously, costs have gone up in the past year but it seems to me that there is a difficulty in respect of the rural regeneration projects, rather than the urban regeneration projects.  Is that the experience of county councils in terms of getting extra funding because of increased costs?  I know Ms Farrelly stated that most projects are up and running but it seems that they are progressing more slowly than was hoped.  Obviously, we are in the pandemic but, leaving that aside, do our guests believe there is a requirement for extra staff to get these projects moving?

My colleagues may also wish to respond.<\/p> <p>  As regards housing, there are ongoing discussions with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding what the new targets may be under the new plan for housing which I understand will be launched in the coming month.  As to whether there is more we can do, we are trying to utilise every avenue for housing delivery, including direct build by the council, working with approved housing bodies, AHBs, and pursuing public private partnerships where they are a smart solution in certain circumstances.  The Senator asked about the LDA.  I do not think there can be too many actors involved in housing provision at this time in terms of ramping up housing supply.  The LDA will play its part in that regard.  It certainly has a big part to play in the provision of affordable rental and affordable housing.  We are all mobilising to do more.  Housing supply can be difficult to get off the ground but we in Fingal, for example, have sites on which we can deliver 3,000 units in the coming years.  These are sites on which we are actively involved in planning or design and hope to get to site on most of them very quickly.  We are already on site in some of the developments.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right with regard to the alignment of priorities across all infrastructure providers.  Land activation requires everybody to be working to the same programme and delivering on time in order to get development happening, whether that is commercial or housing.  There is no doubt that active engagement with the likes of Irish Water to ensure it is doing the right projects in one's area at the right time is the only way we can get sites active.  There is a significant amount of work ongoing in that area.  I am not sure it is as difficult as the Senator suggested.  More probably needs to be done with regard to communication to make sure priorities line up on time, but it has happened quite well in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure I will comment on the staffing issue relating to Irish Water.  It is the subject of ongoing discussion and we might let that take its course in terms of the White Paper.<\/p> <p>  We are engaged in the management of remote working hubs but it is not our wish to staff them ourselves.  Some of my colleagues may wish to come in on this issue.  Ms Delaney may have further information on it.  Most of the hubs will work to a business plan that allows the doors to be open, so to speak, but we assist and are very often involved in the overall management structure for the hubs to ensure they run efficiently.<\/p> <p>  As regards the rural regeneration and development fund and the urban regeneration and development fund, the most frustrating part of any project is design, planning and procurement.  There is no avoiding it in respect of all these projects but it can be frustrating not to see work happening on the ground.  We are working through that for many of the projects.  Obviously, increased costs are a concern and something we will have to keep under review.  The increase in cost happened quite quickly and we do not know where it will bottom out.  Most projects are currently in the design phase, which can be slow.

I refer to the retention of skills in terms of tradespeople.   I have been speaking to several developers and smaller builders in recent months.  It is becoming quite apparent that the current costs in the building sector are very unlikely to unwind because of planning regulations and specifications.  It is going to make housing unaffordable, particularly outside Dublin.  As I stated previously, in Waterford we do not have high-quality jobs like those available in Dublin and affordability is already a very significant issue despite the fact that the housing market has moved on.  Affordability is the central problem.  We are trying to get houses built under the affordability scheme.  A significant amount of social housing is being planned but not a lot of private housing is being done, apart from one-off builds.  What can local authorities do to ensure they have capacity in that regard?  We are hearing that local authorities should be building.  We know there is no capacity within local authorities currently to take on build projects.<\/p><p>It is all done by tender through third parties.

Due to Brexit and distribution issues, we are currently having problems sourcing product, which is impacting on some contracts.  However, the feeling is that as Brexit and distribution issues are addressed, as deliveries ease and product gets easier to find, some of the cost will come back in.  That should alleviate some of the pressures.  In time, as we emerge from the Covid pandemic and come through Brexit, the hope is that we will get the cost back in a relatively straight line and there will be more manageable inflation on some of the contracts.  That is what we are hoping for.  There are some good examples of that.  We have a development arm in Limerick in terms of the public interest works.  Even if councils want to get back into the building game directly, it is very difficult because the staffing is not there.  We will see a lot more special purpose vehicles or joint venture type arrangements that will accelerate the delivery of housing in the future, but it will need to be properly thought out.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, in the case of the Limerick development draft plan, and it may be common to other development plans in trying to address and even get round the issues Senator Ahearn mentioned in respect of Irish Water, where service sites or small clusters emerge, a lot of that is ready-made for small builders and procurement through smaller framework contracts.  We will seek to make some schemes available so that smaller builders can come in.  They will be the right fit for such projects.  The larger density projects will be built by the larger commercial interests.<\/p> <p>  There will probably be a blended approach.  A one-size-fits-all approach will not be the solution.  There will be individual solutions, not just in different locations but in different areas within locations.  For example, county towns will have a different approach from a city or metropolitan area.  It will be a matter of how we structure or organise around that rather than getting involved in building directly.  There may might be a different organisation of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Dr. Daly mentioned small builders.

First, I commend Dr. Daly and the staff in Limerick City and County Council.  They have done the best they can in the past year, which has been very difficult for everyone.  They have done a really good job.  Limerick itself is looking well at the moment.  I was there at the weekend.  It is buzzing again for the first time in a long time.  It is great to see.<\/p> <p>  I have a few queries on the living city initiative.  Obviously, there is a huge Georgian centre in Limerick and a medieval centre around the Nicholas Street area.  What could the Government do to make it easier to bring many of those properties back into use?  I know Dr. Daly said quite a few properties have been brought back into use.  I believe the total is 25.  I have seen some of them myself.  The quality is excellent and the properties have been finished very well.  How do we make it easier for those properties to be brought back into use?  As Dr. Daly will be aware, there is a lot of dereliction, particularly in the Georgian area and Nicholas Street.  Although many of the properties on Nicholas Street have been addressed, there is a lot more to do there.<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns Arthur's Quay.  Is there any specific plan to do something with Arthur's Quay?  We need to reimagine the city in light of the Covid pandemic and the fact we are emerging from it.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the Cleeve's site, would the local authority consider putting social and affordable housing on the Cleeve's site?  To be honest, I do not see any other potential development for that area.<\/p> <p>  My final question concerns infrastructure and the very welcome redevelopment of O'Connell Street.  Has the council had any significant discussions or does it plan to change the initial development plan?  Obviously, the plan was agreed before the Covid-19 pandemic and things have changed during the pandemic.  Will there be any changes to the outcome of the redevelopment of O'Connell Street and the surrounding area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021062300002#L01000","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his kind words.  We are happy to pass them on to colleagues.  In respect of the living city initiative there are two aspects to consider.  We could look at the time bands within it, what buildings fall into it and what buildings could be included.  A study of the impact across the sites and the city may be beneficial in that respect.  We could also look at the tax treatment within the scheme, specifically a potential increase in allowances or, as Mr. Shakespeare and Ms Farrelly mentioned previously, a possible conversion to a grant mechanism.  There is an opportunity in the scheme.  To get it to the scale people are talking about, it would need a rethink and a part overhaul.  However, it could withstand that.  It is probably the last of that particular type of urban regeneration programme that could benefit from a rethink or a tweak.  It is perhaps something to look at as we go into the budget cycle towards the end of the year.  With some changes, strong communication and perhaps some local management, it could work very well.<\/p><p>Arthur's Quay is a sister site adjacent to the Opera site in Limerick.  We are working with a number of partners at the site regarding how it could be developed.  That work is ongoing.  I believe there are opportunities.  Abutting that site is the site for the university campus in the city centre.  There is a ring of development emerging.  Arthur's Quay will be redeveloped as part of that programme, which is exciting because one can see where the city centre is nearly shifting down to that riverside area and the waterfront, which was supported under the urban regeneration and development fund and the Government's schemes.  Limerick received some &euro;116 million to make that happen.  It will be a significant project.<\/p><p> The Cleeves' site is in master planning and the consultants are looking at that.  I imagine they will look at all options around residential, mixed use and commercial, and how that mix will be.  It will most definitely be looked at for social and affordable.<\/p><p> On the infrastructure of O'Connell Street, we are on-site and we are disrupting Limerick city centre a little bit at the moment.  I am sure our traders are hopeful.  They have been very patient so far and with a little bit more patience we will get the benefit.  There have not been many changes because we are working to the panning permission on it and we must be careful of it.  The revitalisation project was designed to cater for more pedestrianisation, a reduced thoroughfare, a specific public transport lane, a reduction to one motor lane from the current two lanes and a lot more paving animation on the public side.  Once we get through the works and people begin to see each phase emerge, hopefully they will be very impressed and happy with it.  It will really future-proof the main street in Limerick.  It will be quite exciting.

I am joined by my colleagues Patrick Farrell, our retail banking director, and Kevin Hewston, interim chief operations officer.  This is my first appearance before the committee since being appointed chief executive of the bank in June of last year.<\/p> <p>  Firstly, I assure the committee that I will always listen to the committee members and give them whatever assistance I can, and that I want Permanent TSB to bring vigorous competition, better service, better products and better value to Irish customers and small businesses in communities across Ireland.  I want to build a sustainable bank for the future and at the centre of any sustainable business is the responsibility it has to its customers.<\/p> <p>  As soon as I took up my position I set out a new purpose for Permanent TSB.  This is centred on building trust with our customers and connecting with the bank&rsquo;s community heritage, which has evolved over the past 200 years from our unique roots in communities throughout Ireland as the former Irish Permanent Building Society and the former First Trustee Savings Banks.  I set out this purpose because I want Permanent TSB to be known for having a strong sense of social purpose and one that plays a broader role in Irish society.  I strongly believe that maximising the return for customers leads to maximising the return for shareholders over the long term.  At the heart of growing a truly sustainable business is the fair treatment of and good returns for customers, acknowledging the requirement for any bank to make a return on capital so as to be financially sustainable.<\/p> <p>  While we still have more work to do to further build trust with customers, and I acknowledge there are legacy issues from the past, we are taking steps in the right direction and over the last year we have put our purpose into action with a number of measures.  We have kept all 76 of our branches open throughout the pandemic and committed to maintaining our existing branch network.  In addition to the &euro;30 million investment over the last five years, we have committed to investing a further &euro;5 million over the coming year in refurbishing and maintaining branches to make sure they remain an attractive place for our customers to do business.  We made significant cuts to our mortgage interest rates, both for new and existing customers, with greater fairness in our mortgage pricing and a shift towards offering the same rates to both new and existing customers.  We have supported our customers who were affected by the pandemic with more than 13,000 payment breaks to give these customers valuable breathing space at a time of significant upheaval.  We continue to work closely with some 1,000 customers who require ongoing support.  We supported the provision of affordable and social housing with a partnership between the bank and the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, in which the bank provides financial and operational support to the &Oacute; Cualann group.  We achieved the Business Working Responsibly Mark, which is the leading standard for corporate social responsibility and sustainability certification in Ireland.  We have also announced plans to hire more than 180 new staff with a particular focus on IT skills, to complement a &euro;150 million investment in our IT systems and digital banking capabilities.  We have announced a major initiative to grow our presence in the SME lending market, which included teaming up with the State&rsquo;s Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, to provide more than &euro;50 million in new low-cost lending to small businesses.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the single biggest example of our commitment to making things better for customers, our communities and the wider economy is our announcement in February that we are in discussions with the NatWest Group to acquire certain elements of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s retail and SME banking business.  This shows our ambition to become Ireland&rsquo;s best personal and small business bank, a bank with deep roots in Irish communities that can bring even greater competition to customers at a time when customers need competition more than ever.  If we are successful in agreeing commercial terms, Permanent TSB will be a bank with more customers, a larger footprint, greater reach and a greater ability to bring new and better products and services to retail and SME customers.<\/p> <p>  Before I conclude my opening remarks I must offer the committee an apology with regard to the level of detail I can go into at this stage about our discussions with the NatWest Group.  I hope members will appreciate that both sides have agreed to conduct these negotiations in the strictest of confidentiality and I must also respect our disclosure obligations as a company that is quoted on the Dublin and London stock exchanges.  I can say that I have been greatly encouraged at how constructively both sides are approaching these discussions.  It is my aim that we will reach an agreement that will benefit customers and create value for the State through its shareholding in the bank.<\/p> <p>  I reaffirm our commitment to continuing to support customers as we exit the Covid-19 pandemic and in demonstrating our purpose of building trust with customers.

The Senator is correct that 44 of our branches are moving to automated cash services but I will explain what that allows us to do.  Our focus in those branches is to ensure we can stop doing the administrative tasks behind the counter and get our staff out front of house so when one comes into our branches one is met by a person.  We acknowledge consumer behaviour has changed drastically, particularly in the last 15 months, towards more mobile and online banking.  Our customers also really want to meet a person and the core of our bank at a community level has always been about people.  We are still able to do 98% of the in-branch transactions that a person could have done when there was a cash desk but by using state-of-the-art automated machines we are able to get our staff out front of house to engage with our customers to help and assist them.<\/p><p>We also have a 100-strong external workforce in the community.

I would like to a clear picture of what exactly he is describing when he refers to going out into the community.<\/p> <p>  I share his view that people want to meet a person.  He described it as an administrative task.  People using cash desks meet members of staff.  Whether people are standing in the foyer or behind a desk, customers are meeting a person.  Our concern is that they will meet fewer people and will instead be pointed in the direction of a machine.

We are building up our direct bank with a phone and mobile banking service.  I am talking about people on the ground.  Prior to Covid, we had moved to getting our people out into the community.  As I mentioned, we have a 100-strong workforce that can deal with customers, which involves current and deposit accounts, mortgages, consumer finance, etc.  Covid has put paid to people visiting homes and businesses before now, but now that we are coming out of the pandemic it is about mobilising that workforce again to get back into the community.

We completed the investigation with the Central Bank in May 2019 and paid the fine at that stage.  We admitted to misdemeanours with respect to publication.  That was more than two years ago. <\/p> <p>  We continue to engage with the FSPO with regard to tracker cases where customers have, in some cases, raised those cases directly with it.  They do not necessarily have to come to the bank to raise those issues, and can instead go directly to the ombudsman.  In the region of 200 cases are with the ombudsman at this moment in time.  We also have some cases of tracker customers, which are in a legal process through the court system.<\/p><p>There are approximately 80 cases at present.  With regard to the number of impacted accounts, there are more than 2,000 and we have redressed and compensated these customers.<\/p><p> With respect to the comment on the 18 findings from the FSPO, naturally this is something on which we engaged with the ombudsman directly.  Some of the findings were partial findings and others were full findings against the bank, depending on the nature of the engagement.

Hence, the engagement with the ombudsman is more mature and we had more cases earlier than other banks.  This is what may give rise to these numbers.  We absolutely accept that engagement not only with the ombudsman but also with customers is very important to resolve this issue.<\/p><p> With regard to the number of properties that were at issue, I do not have the exact number in front of me but it was in the region of 40.  I apologise, it is one of the items I just do not have to hand but it is something I will come back to.

The problem here is that Mr. Crowley's predecessor apologised through the committee but now we have learned from the Central Bank that at the time of those apologies, when Mr. Crowley's predecessor was saying the bank had learned a lesson and was apologising for what was happening, the bank was continuing to inflict harm on some of its customers through this process, right up until 2018.

Also, banking business models in Europe are somewhat under threat because of negative interest rates and excess liquidity.  That is the case in Ireland more so than other European countries.  Credit formation has been low in recent years arising from the crisis and the difficulties that gave.  Also, saving rates have increased significantly.  Savings among Irish households are up &euro;30 billion in the last three years, with over &euro;15 billion of that in the last year alone.  There is an excess of liquidity over lending.  That excess liquidity attracts a negative rate and is having an impact on the profitability of banks and the return we make as organisations.<\/p> <p>  To come back to the core point, if I take Irish share prices in their own right, they were much impacted by Covid and the uncertainty of Brexit.  We saw that once there was some positive news on Brexit, together with a lifting of Covid restrictions or at least a visibility of that, Irish share prices have recently increased.  Our share price has gone up significantly but I would also suggest that it is based on speculation around our previous discussion relating to the Ulster Bank franchise.  In more recent weeks, the share prices have come down slightly but they are at a higher level versus where they were in recent years.  I would suggest that there is an anticipated increase in commercial activity among wider society post pandemic.

I would like to question the witnesses on the banking market in Ireland, which looks to be broken.  What I mean by saying it looks to be broken is that there are two major players with 85% of the market at this stage.  It is an oligopoly for all intents and purposes.

I cannot go into the specific detail, but an element of our negotiations with Ulster Bank concerns aspects of its business book.  We want to provide more competition in that area.<\/p><p> Turning to the mortgage side, I believe there is plenty of competition in this area.  The market shares of the two main banks have been staying stable, or falling in some cases, in recent years.  Our market share, for instance, has been increasing, as has that of others, such as the non-bank lenders.  Therefore, it is quite a competitive market and there is a lot of information for customers.  We must compete like everybody else in that respect.  Naturally, there has been some comment, particularly arising from the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, report in February, regarding the level of capital required by banks to support mortgage lending.  It highlights the competitive nature of how interest rates and costs are driven in respect of banks making a return.  I believe there will be more debate on this aspect in due course.  However, the retail area of banking is very competitive, no company has it its own way and market shares in recent years show that it is not a one-way bet.  It is necessary to work hard for every mortgage and work with all customers in a proactive way to get them from application to draw down and, ultimately, to get them keys to their own homes.  We have been doing that for many years, and we want to continue to do that to provide competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I am approaching this subject from the perspective of the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC.

My final question refers to the issue Deputy Farrell raised about mica.  Can Mr. Crowley elaborate on his comments?  Being helpful to customers can mean ten different things.  It can mean low interest rates.  It can mean forbearance in terms of mortgages.  The core issue here is what was expected by my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, and I when we wrote to the banks, and by the MICA Action Group at the time.  We were looking for PTSB and other banks to support the redress scheme by contributing to it, but they refused to do so.  Does Mr. Crowley foresee a scenario whereby there would be a contribution from the bank as a result of the mica redress scheme?<\/p> <p>  Can Mr. Crowley explain how a loan for a mica affected property is classified on the books of PTSB?  Let us be clear on this.  We have seen that one third of homes that applied for the scheme in Donegal need to be demolished, therefore, their asset value is zero.  Some of those assets are secured by PTSB loans.  How are those loans classified on the books of PTSB?<\/p><p>Has the fact that the assets are now valueless triggered an impairment review?  How is PTSB dealing with those assets and what are its obligations with regard to reporting?  There are clear obligations for impairment of loans.  One of those obligations relates to cases where the value of the assets that are secured on the loan drops, and in these cases the value has, unfortunately, dropped significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021062300002#H02100","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

We understand that scheme may change but, as I understand it from the BPFI, we are not aware of the details.  There is absolute acceptance that PTSB must play its part by supporting customers who, for reasons beyond their own control and creation, have been affected by this issue.  We have experience of cases where customers were partially or fully impacted by the pyrite issue.  We moved to support those customers directly.<\/p> <p>  I also mentioned that we are engaging with some customers on their position, particularly through our Letterkenny branch.

It is not about contributing to the cost of restoring assets on the bank's balance sheets.  As the CEO of PTSB, does Mr. Crowley believe the bank has a role in that domain?

Daily and weekly briefings are being provided to multiple stakeholders.  Third, the assess phase, which involves the restoration of services and eradication of ransomware from the network.  That phase is continuing.  Finally, the remedy phase, which involves strengthening our network against future cyber threats.  That phase is continuing.<\/p> <p>  The restoration process and the accompanying due diligence exercise is necessarily taking some time.  Although we can effectively decrypt data, that is only one element of it.  The malware must also be eradicated.  Decryption takes much longer than the original encryption, and eradication involves additional tasks to ensure that the perpetrators have no access route back into our systems.  We have worked with specialist cybersecurity firms and our application vendors to develop solutions to improve the efficiency of the decryption and eradication process, and it is showing dividends.  So far, 75% of our server estate has been decrypted and 70% of our end-user devices are now available.<\/p> <p>  While the architecture of our network dictates a certain initial sequence to the restoration of services, the majority of our sequencing decisions are clinically informed.  We are focusing our efforts on restoring the systems most critical to patient care in the first instance.  From a technical standpoint, many systems are now operational again, but restoring interoperability between systems and sites is ongoing.  That continues to impact on service delivery.  Characteristically, our staff across the country have worked extremely hard to keep services going in the face of the enormous challenges presented by the cyberattack and ensuing shutdown.  They are doing this at a time when our health system is experiencing very high demand for services.  I want to particularly thank staff for their hard work and commitment to the delivery of services to the public at this time.  Our IT staff, supported by the Defence Forces and contracted IT experts, have maintained a relentless schedule.  This continues seven days a week.<\/p> <p>  There is no underestimating the damage that this cyberattack has caused.  There are financial costs, certainly, but there will, unfortunately, also be human costs.  I assure members and the public that we are doing everything possible to restore the systems.  I must also caution that it will likely take months before systems are fully restored.  Accordingly, I must ask the public for continued forbearance and understanding.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to say that the Covid-19 vaccination programme is making really good progress.  We administered 340,000 vaccinations last week and GPs have administered close to 1.5 million vaccines.  Our other vaccination channels, namely, community-based vaccination teams, acute hospitals, ambulance and community pharmacies, are also functioning very effectively indeed.<\/p> <p>  We have 39 vaccination centres in place.  Over 3.7 million vaccines have been administered.  Over 2.3 million people have now received a first dose, or single dose, of the vaccine and over 1.3 million have received a second dose, or single dose.<\/p><p>Our key objective in prioritising vaccine cohorts is to protect the most vulnerable.  It is apparent, given the major drop in hospitalisations and mortality, that we are achieving this.<\/p><p> It is probably accepted by everyone that the health and well-being of mothers and babies has been at the heart of maternity visit restrictions, which I accept are a significant burden.  Hospitals must apply infection prevention and control measures in a manner appropriate to the physical infrastructure that they have.  We have provided guidance on partner access as I will outline.  Maternity services should facilitate a minimum of a 30 minute visit daily.  The partner should be facilitated during labour while the woman is in the labour ward.  It may not be possible to facilitate women in multi-occupancy antenatal wards before they go to the labour ward.  Partners should be facilitated at the anomaly scan and any other visit that may involve communications of emotional significance.  Parents should be facilitated in the national neonatal intensive care unit, NICU.  Given the improved Covid-19 situation, we recently asked all maternity hospitals and units to review their approach again.  This week, the national women and infants health programme is meeting with the clinical leads of the six maternity networks.  Subject to infrastructure limitations, I am confident that the least restrictive approach possible will be adopted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Good morning.

Regarding the cyberattack and cost, there are a few aspects for now and the future, as the Senator said.  We will incur a number of costs in the short and medium term.  As the Senator described, much technical work will have to be carried out on the network and infrastructure.  There are capital costs to replace a number of devices across our networks which we believe it would not be best practice to leave on the network with the new controls that we will put in place.  There are also capital costs where we will need to and will take the opportunity to upgrade some of our key systems, such as national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS, our radiology system, to bring them up to a higher standard.  Third party costs, as the Senator mentioned, relate to technical expertise that we have engaged including some of the best technical experts from a range of specialist providers that we have engaged in the country.  As the Senator rightly said, we have also engaged international expertise, primarily the international organisation in the USA, Mandiant, which is working on the decryption process.  It is a world leader in malware and ransomware recovery.  It has been working with us since the cyberattack.  There are costs across a range of providers.<\/p> <p>  We will have to incur costs in the future, considering the scale and size of our networks.  I worked on networks previously in different organisations.  Many organisations have a 24-hour monitoring centre, sometimes called a service operation centre or network operation centre.  Due to the scale of the network, we will need to put in place a security operation centre to monitor our network much more comprehensively for 24 hours.  We will take the opportunity to update many of our Microsoft applications to Microsoft 365 and a significant cost will be associated with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Reid estimate the costs to be approximately &euro;500 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#C00400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The immediate costs are well over &euro;100 million, including capital and revenue costs, just to get through this.

In the short to medium term, it will cost significantly over &euro;100 million to get through this process and we are working on the medium and longer-term impacts.  It is clear, if one looks back at the previous three years, that we invested approximately &euro;82 million in malware and security protection, and a number of associated actions.

While attendances have gone up, the admission rate has not changed hugely in many sites.  Prior to the cyberattack, the patient flow was much improved.  We had seen an increase, but because of the some of the capacity the Deputy referenced earlier in terms of our hospital avoidance measures and egress options, we have seen the lowest ever rate of delayed discharges.

The first is in regard to student nurses and midwives in placements.  There was a commitment to pay them &euro;100 and that was to be backdated.  My understanding, having engaged with the INMO, is that not all students have been paid.  I do not know if that is down to the cyberattack or if there is some other reason for it.

The last time Mr. Reid appeared before the committee, the Minister had said that the worst-case scenario for June was about 60,000 doses of the Janssen vaccine, with the best-case scenario being 230,000.  My understanding is we might have got about 70,000.  We were expecting very significant amounts of the Janssen vaccine in July.  Again, my understanding is that will be at the lower end of the expectation.  We know the Janssen vaccine is also being made available to pharmacists.

Because of manufacturing problems in the US, that was revised down to a best case of 235,000 and a worst case of 60,000.  I would anticipate it being closer to the worst-case scenario based on the recent feedback from Janssen.  We will see how the usage of it works out in pharmacies.  We will have some more deliveries to assist the pharmacies if needs be and if they have additional demand in June.  As Mr. Reid mentioned earlier, based on the current guidance, the Janssen vaccine would not be available to us for use within the programme beyond that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the HSE CEO and his team.

I will make a brief comment on his opening comments about vaccines.  We certainly are in a much stronger position than we could have expected in terms of the benefits we are seeing from the vaccination programme, both in reduced hospitalisations and visits to ICU.  As of last night, we had 39 hospitalisations, of whom 13 were in ICU.  Contrast that with the dark days of January when there were 2,020 in hospital and 212 people in ICU.  We are seeing the benefits, including in the public mood.<\/p> <p>  Our experience and that of the public is that every time we think we are ahead of the virus, whether that was last summer or Christmas, it has a tendency to bite back.  The immediate concern is the Delta variant.  We are seeing in the percentage rise in cases, not just in Ireland but in European countries and cities, a very prevalent surge in the Delta variant.  There is no reason to expect that Ireland will be any different or that we will not see a surge in Delta variant cases.  That is a trend we are beginning to see and it is a concern.  Notwithstanding that, we are in a much stronger position than we might have expected.<\/p> <p>  On vaccines for the 60 to 69 years cohort, we take all of our administration of vaccines guidance from the national immunisation advisory committee.  It gives guidance to the CMO who makes recommendations to the Government and we comply with all of that.  In fairness to NIAC, it takes the best world evidence and monitors that carefully daily and weekly.  It continues to do that.  The guidance and advice at that stage was that AstraZenica was suitable to be administered to people above the ages of 50.  The risks that were prevalent at that stage were to population ages below that.  That was the process then.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the timeframe, it had been, if the Deputy recalls, the administration of a second dose was moved from 12 weeks to 16 weeks.  That interval has now moved back to eight weeks.  We have a programme in place whereby last week alone, almost 100,000 people were given their second dose of AstraZenica.  This applies to about 450,000 people in total.  The process will be accelerated and instead of a nine-week programme, it will be a five-week programme.  Everybody in all the age groups that received AstraZenica should have received the second dose by the week commencing 19 July.  That accelerates the process and we will increasingly see people in the 60 to 69 years cohort.  We are vaccinating by age so the vast majority of the people who received the second dose last week should have been in that age cohort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":282,"content":"<p>On the opening of the economy on 5 July, we could soon have large numbers of unvaccinated young people who work in hospitality working in an indoor environment.

The way the process works is that the guidance to the Government as to potential impacts, concerns or recommendations regarding the opening the economy will come through the CMO and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  That is the process.  From the HSE's perspective, we are obviously keenly focused on the impacts on hospitalisation and ICU admissions and the impacts on our hospital service in general.  After every wave of this virus, we have suffered significant impacts not only on Covid care, but on the care services we provide more widely.  Our concerns relate to sickness, illness, hospitalisations and their impact.  There is certainly evidence emerging from Public Health England demonstrating the impact of the variant, particularly on those people who have not been vaccinated or who have not been fully vaccinated.  The HSE has two key messages.  The first is that we want to monitor things closely because we cannot let what happened in January happen again, where hospitalisations reached over 2,000 and when more than 200 people were in our ICUs.  This had an impact on an already exhausted healthcare staff.  That is what we in the HSE will be watching.

I have questions on three areas, namely, third level students, children with cancer, and maternity restrictions, which I am sure the witnesses will receive further questions on after I conclude.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the vaccination of third level students in August and September.  I have been contacted by a number of students who are going abroad either on the Erasmus programme or for international studies.  Some of the institutions they are going to have said that the students cannot attend unless they can prove they have been vaccinated, otherwise they will not be able to attend on-campus.  Are there plans for those students?  It is not an enormous cohort but there will be a number of students who, having paid and are ready, will not be able to go abroad or will have to delay going because they will not be vaccinated in time.  Has any thought been given to that situation?<\/p> <p>  I have a second question for Mr. McCallion in relation to children with cancer.  Children with cancer and their parents are still waiting to hear when vaccines will be made available to children aged 12 to 15.  I know the Pfizer vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, but there has been no word yet from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, on this.  We are waiting on NIAC to give the go ahead.  Has the HSE given any consideration on how it will prioritise these high-risk patients in that age group, because they have been isolating for a long time and, obviously, the parents are extremely concerned about their children.  I will throw all my questions out and the witnesses can do as they will with them.<\/p> <p>  On the maternity restrictions, why are the risk assessments not publicly accessible despite the calls from Dr. Peter McKenna in April, and the HSE in May, to make them public?  Is there any further information as to why these risk assessments are not available?  On 10 May, Dr. Tony Holohan said that there should be a return to pre-pandemic partner access.  There still seems to be mixed messages on when that will happen.  Do the witnesses know when that is going to happen, whether it will be in the coming months or weeks?<\/p> <p>  The vaccination levels among maternity unit staff, and pregnant people and partners will affect restrictions.  Obviously, vaccination levels are extremely high among maternity staff and levels are climbing among pregnant people and their partners.  What is the current position of the HSE on the risk associated with partner attendance in maternity units, where other public health guidelines, such as social distancing and the wearing of personal protective equipment, are taken into account?  There was reference made in the guidelines that partners could not be allowed in for privacy reasons, I am sure the witnesses are aware of this.  That was never a reason in pre-pandemic times.  Therefore, why has privacy suddenly started to be referred to as a reason that pregnant peoples' partners need to be kept away from certain things, when that was not the case before the pandemic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#H00700","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I will make a few comments and they pass to my colleagues, Mr. McCallion and Dr. Henry.  On the first issue of third level students and their vaccination, it is worth reminding members of the committee and ourselves that the whole approach, in terms of the vaccination programme, has been to vaccinate those who are most vulnerable first, and it is working.  We started to programme based on NIAC advice, which was starting with residents and staff in long-term care facilities, moving on to healthcare workers, then people over the higher age groups and, indeed, medically vulnerable groups.  We should remain confident that this was the correct approach, that is what is working for Ireland and working for our vaccination programme.  There have been many calls throughout the programme to date, at the very early stages, the middle stages and now, to look to different groups at different stages.  We take our absolute advice, guidance and direction from NIAC and through the Chief Medical Officer and Government policy.  I reiterate that is has worked, it is working, and we should continue with it based on the process of working through the age groups.  It is based on limited supply and if we had a full supply, we would love to vaccinate all age cohorts together, but we must stick with what is working, and that is my very strong message to the committee.  I will pass to my colleague, Dr. Henry, on the visits question, and then to Mr. McCallion, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>We want to restore to the pre-pandemic levels but, as I said earlier, we are mindful of the particular risks in pregnancy and the evolving data, including that from the UK obstetric surveillance system, in March 2021, which looked at stillbirth rates.

We are in the happy position where we can release those incrementally.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hoey referred to the privacy issue.  Generally speaking, when women were in labour pre-pandemic, they had partners with them on the labour ward, but it was not always the case for a woman who may have been in suspect early-labour and was returned to a multi-occupancy antenatal ward, to have their partners in there, to give respect to other patients on the ward.  There is some degree of misunderstanding of what prevailed before the pandemic began.  As I said earlier, in response to one of the Senator's colleagues' question, we are now moving beyond those four areas.  We are trying to restore attendances to the areas of greatest need and that includes, pregnancy assessment units, high-risk pregnancy routine visits, and emergency presentation of late gestation.

If we can vaccinate a large group quickly, we have found that to be nearly as effective as trying to isolate numbers and then trying to extract those.  We look at all of those factors before we come up with a plan.  We are doing that planning through our planning team and national immunisation office, in parallel with the work going with NIAC on looking at the evidence and so on in terms of vaccinating, so that if a recommendation comes from NIAC, we have assessed the options and looked at the best way to do it.

That would be part of the solution in terms of how we do it.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, it could come down to the speed at which we can roll this out.

The high levels of community transmission and the outbreak obviously led to severe restrictions.  Cases falling, hospitals becoming safer and the vaccination programme taking hold have allowed us to ease visiting restrictions.  It is under constant review.  I mentioned to Deputy Crowe's colleagues earlier that the most recent review this week is expanding beyond those four areas which are listed in the opening statement to additional areas.<\/p> <p>  We issued guidance.  We contacted all the hospitals.  There is, as has been mentioned, some variation based on infrastructure, which is understandable.  Some of these maternity units are quite old, with infrastructure which corresponds to another age when it comes to ideal infection prevention control measures.  Our principal aim is to keep women, babies and pregnancies safe.  That is of great importance to us given the risk we are now aware of, not just from Ireland but from abroad, to both women and pregnancies from Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  The most recent advice, which we will be altering this week, goes into those additional areas.  I will not repeat them again because I have stated them to the Deputy's colleagues.  We then follow up through our operations, working with Ms O'Connor and her colleagues through all those 19 maternity units and marking them against compliance with the latest iteration of our visiting guidance.

A medical doctor recently said on radio, which I thought was well put, that pregnancy and labour are medical conditions.  In most cases, but not all, the person is good health, and that needs to be stressed.<\/p> <p>  There are situations in which a maternity hospital is co-located with a medical hospital and there are complexities with that.  However, there needs to be uniformity here because there are so many expectant mothers - you would want to see the trail of emails which came in overnight - who are very stressed and worried, many of whom will even give birth today not knowing if their partners can be there for all parts of it or if their partners can attend key appointments if they are at a different stage of pregnancy.  It is morally cruel they are denied.  I hope the guidelines being issued will be taken up by all hospitals, because there is no political barrier to this.

That is the key driver for us and for all our clinical and medical teams across the country.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Henry will answer on specifics but we get returns from the 19 individual maternity hospitals on the implementation of the guidance document that Dr. Henry sent out nationally.  In fairness, I mentioned earlier that 16 of the 19 were fully compliant last Thursday.  The three that were not put in measures to be fully compliant for this week.  When I say a hospital is not compliant, it is not that those concerned are mischievously going out to be non-compliant.  They have certain conditions in their hospital where they find it difficult to find the risk balance between access and visits and infection prevention and control.  That is the rationale and the reason this happens.  <\/p> <p>  As for the waiting lists for surgery, with every wave we have, our waiting lists for people for various forms of surgery and elective care are affected.  The national service plan for this year has two funds, namely, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, of &euro;125 million and the access to care fund, which is about &euro;210 million.  We are working collaboratively with our colleagues in the Department of Health and with the Minister about an approach for the best use of those funds to address some of the waiting lists.  To be frank, it has been significantly impactful for us, particularly with the recent cyberattack.  It will involve a combination of using private capacity, using the NTPF, strengthening further capacity through the recruitment of consultants and other teams in our public hospitals and new ways of working that my colleague Ms Anne O'Connor has implemented during Covid, which involve many outpatient departments getting waiting lists in a very different way.

It was heartbreaking.  Another lady wrote how women and their partners are looking for a return to pre-pandemic levels of access through the pregnancy journey.  She queried the distinction between full labour and active labour and stated that women in labour need support and advocacy whether they are 1 cm, 4 cm or 10 cm dilated.  This is the whole point.  I have spoken to officials in Galway on this point of how you define labour.  Once a woman goes into a maternity hospital and presents to give birth, her partner should be there with them at all stages, as well as for 12-week and 20-week scans in particular.  They do not know what news they are going to get.  Where they get difficult news, they need to have their partner present, no ifs or buts.<\/p><p> I know that at times doctors can become immune to problems because they see so many of them, and I understand that, but women and their partners need to be together for these heartbreaking situations they have to go through where they receive bad news - and even where they do not receive bad news and the woman is just delivery a baby.  Even the normal, successful delivery of a child is an emotional roller coaster for women and their partners, and the latter need to be present.  We need to see that in place in all our maternity hospitals - no exceptions, no ifs and no buts.  Whatever has to be done to ensure that this happens needs to be done.  That is not a question; those are just comments based on testimony.  There has been enough uncertainty.  We have seen the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  As I said, the women need to have their partners present and need the support and love of a partner, whatever about good news, certainly in the case of bad news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00900","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will go through the Senator's points.  I absolutely agree with him.  Our staff in the 19 maternity units want to be able to go back to a situation whereby partners can be full partners in every sense of the word during the whole process of childbirth, which, as the Senator says, is a difficult and anxious time.  It is mostly a happy time but sometimes, of course, as the Senator outlined, there are difficulties and bad news.  That is precisely why we are looking at this latest visitor guidance this week.  We are amending it to look at exactly those areas where there may be difficult news and particular anxiety, that is, those early pregnancy assessment units, people with high-risk pregnancies and people presenting in emergency situations in later pregnancy.  I mentioned earlier that nobody wanted to put in these restrictions but we were faced with overwhelming Covid disease and threat in January.  It threatened to destabilise our hospital system and, in fact, it did destabilise it.  There were multiple outbreaks in various settings.  Fifteen of those 19 units are co-located with general hospitals.  Those measures were put in place, as were the general visiting restriction measures, which also caused great distress to relatives and sick people in general hospitals and in nursing homes.  The measures were put in place in order to try to protect people as much as possible from the worst effects of this virus.  It is exactly those areas the Senator outlines that we are trying to focus on now as we return to some kind of normality.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned labour.  The practice has been, and the advice is very clear, that partners should be present in labour wards.  Sometimes women go back to antenatal wards after initial assessment.  Many of our units, which are not modern by any stretch of the imagination, are multiple occupancy wards and, as such, it was not the practice pre pandemic to have partners there constantly when other women occupy the wards.  What we are trying to standardise and to bring into practice, and what we have in those 19 units, is that a partner have every right to be present in the labour ward during labour.  What we are not able to commit to, however, based on the varying infrastructure of hospitals, is that people be present in the antenatal ward where it is a multiple occupancy ward because of the rights and privacy requirements of other women on that ward.<\/p> <p>  These are heartbreaking stories.  As I said, our staff, our working nurses and doctors, want to see pre-pandemic visiting practices return but they have had a very difficult few months themselves trying to keep women safe, to protect pregnancies and to protect women during what was certainly the worst surge of Covid-19 in January and February, during which we learned Covid is not without danger and risk to pregnancies and to women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Henry.  I accept the situation we were in post Christmas but we are in a much different situation now.  As I said, the heartbreaking testimonies we have seen over recent months cut to the core of life and death and expectant mothers' worry.  We therefore need to get back to whatever operated pre pandemic for expectant mothers.  They need to have that love and support of a partner for delivery and for scans.  Positive scans are fine, but you just do not know when you go in there what news you will get.  Again, reading the testimonies, where there is an anomaly, news may be delivered to women on their own, with no support.  They may be told to wait in a room or have to deliver news to their families in a car park.  It is unacceptable that that would be the way in which things operate in a hospital in this day and age.  I appreciate that Covid is the reason the restrictions are there, but for something as personal and as heartbreaking as this there needs to be a better system.  Cognisance needs to be taken of the delivery of the news and having partners there with the expectant mothers to provide that love and support and comfort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#L00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I will follow on from that point about the maternity hospital visits.  I am listening to what the witnesses are saying about the risk balance and the argument that you can be as compassionate as you wish but it is down to the layout of the hospitals.  The simple question is whether the hospitals are looking at their layouts.  Can anything be done to rearrange wards?  I am told this has happened in some hospitals.  I suppose what many members are looking for is possibly a more imaginative approach if at all possible, even if the partner were to use PPE or something coming in for that visit, that news or whatever else.  Could we send out even that message, that we are looking at all areas, that we are listening to the stories people have to tell about their difficulties and that the approach will be as imaginative as possible?

I totally agree with what the Chairman says.  It is not enough for us to accept matters at face value.  We did not do so when we did our first survey and found that a number of hospitals were not compliant.  Our response to them was this: what do you need to do to become compliant?  This was notwithstanding concerns they had about infection prevention and control and their infrastructure.  It is because of that ongoing questioning and interrogation and the direct advocacy and concerns of the women and partners involved that we are pushing hospitals to do whatever they can to comply with the guidance we have given out, which, as I said, is about recovering as quickly as we can to that pre-pandemic level.  I do not mean to labour the point but, as I said, and as the Chairman echoed, we are constantly balancing the risk.  We have found that Covid-19 is a very volatile virus in its impact on the population in healthcare settings.  The vaccination programme brings great additional protection to people and certainly has allowed us much greater freedom and has opened up choice for us in respect of visiting and other hospital services.  I totally support what the Chairman says.  We need our hospitals to be innovative to acknowledge the importance of partners, particularly in difficult situations, as Senator Kyne outlined.

There is a small number, less than 100, of referrals over recent weeks remaining and they are being scheduled.

As we move into the groups comprising people in their 30s and 20s, that work continues through various media platforms, advocacy groups, influencers and sporting groups that work with us on communicating about the roll-out.

That is the direction that Dr. Henry has given to the 19 maternity hospitals.

Speaking from the HSE's perspective, everyone needs to make a personal risk assessment of travel, particularly in the context of the prevalence of the Delta variant.
