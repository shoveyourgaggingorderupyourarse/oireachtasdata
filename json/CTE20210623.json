It severely disabled a number of systems and necessitated the complete shutdown of the HSE's network.  We have been working to recover systems ever since.  The HSE response contains four stages.  First, the containment phase, which is now completed.  Second, the inform phase, which is also complete, but the task is ongoing.  Daily and weekly briefings are being provided to multiple stakeholders.  Third, the assess phase, which involves the restoration of services and eradication of ransomware from the network.  That phase is continuing.  Finally, the remedy phase, which involves strengthening our network against future cyber threats.  That phase is continuing.<\/p> <p>  The restoration process and the accompanying due diligence exercise is necessarily taking some time.  Although we can effectively decrypt data, that is only one element of it.  The malware must also be eradicated.  Decryption takes much longer than the original encryption, and eradication involves additional tasks to ensure that the perpetrators have no access route back into our systems.  We have worked with specialist cybersecurity firms and our application vendors to develop solutions to improve the efficiency of the decryption and eradication process, and it is showing dividends.  So far, 75% of our server estate has been decrypted and 70% of our end-user devices are now available.<\/p> <p>  While the architecture of our network dictates a certain initial sequence to the restoration of services, the majority of our sequencing decisions are clinically informed.  We are focusing our efforts on restoring the systems most critical to patient care in the first instance.  From a technical standpoint, many systems are now operational again, but restoring interoperability between systems and sites is ongoing.  That continues to impact on service delivery.  Characteristically, our staff across the country have worked extremely hard to keep services going in the face of the enormous challenges presented by the cyberattack and ensuing shutdown.  They are doing this at a time when our health system is experiencing very high demand for services.  I want to particularly thank staff for their hard work and commitment to the delivery of services to the public at this time.  Our IT staff, supported by the Defence Forces and contracted IT experts, have maintained a relentless schedule.  This continues seven days a week.<\/p> <p>  There is no underestimating the damage that this cyberattack has caused.  There are financial costs, certainly, but there will, unfortunately, also be human costs.  I assure members and the public that we are doing everything possible to restore the systems.  I must also caution that it will likely take months before systems are fully restored.  Accordingly, I must ask the public for continued forbearance and understanding.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to say that the Covid-19 vaccination programme is making really good progress.  We administered 340,000 vaccinations last week and GPs have administered close to 1.5 million vaccines.  Our other vaccination channels, namely, community-based vaccination teams, acute hospitals, ambulance and community pharmacies, are also functioning very effectively indeed.<\/p> <p>  We have 39 vaccination centres in place.  Over 3.7 million vaccines have been administered.  Over 2.3 million people have now received a first dose, or single dose, of the vaccine and over 1.3 million have received a second dose, or single dose.<\/p><p>Our key objective in prioritising vaccine cohorts is to protect the most vulnerable.  It is apparent, given the major drop in hospitalisations and mortality, that we are achieving this.<\/p><p> It is probably accepted by everyone that the health and well-being of mothers and babies has been at the heart of maternity visit restrictions, which I accept are a significant burden.  Hospitals must apply infection prevention and control measures in a manner appropriate to the physical infrastructure that they have.  We have provided guidance on partner access as I will outline.  Maternity services should facilitate a minimum of a 30 minute visit daily.  The partner should be facilitated during labour while the woman is in the labour ward.  It may not be possible to facilitate women in multi-occupancy antenatal wards before they go to the labour ward.  Partners should be facilitated at the anomaly scan and any other visit that may involve communications of emotional significance.  Parents should be facilitated in the national neonatal intensive care unit, NICU.  Given the improved Covid-19 situation, we recently asked all maternity hospitals and units to review their approach again.  This week, the national women and infants health programme is meeting with the clinical leads of the six maternity networks.  Subject to infrastructure limitations, I am confident that the least restrictive approach possible will be adopted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Good morning.

Regarding the cyberattack and cost, there are a few aspects for now and the future, as the Senator said.  We will incur a number of costs in the short and medium term.  As the Senator described, much technical work will have to be carried out on the network and infrastructure.  There are capital costs to replace a number of devices across our networks which we believe it would not be best practice to leave on the network with the new controls that we will put in place.  There are also capital costs where we will need to and will take the opportunity to upgrade some of our key systems, such as national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS, our radiology system, to bring them up to a higher standard.  Third party costs, as the Senator mentioned, relate to technical expertise that we have engaged including some of the best technical experts from a range of specialist providers that we have engaged in the country.  As the Senator rightly said, we have also engaged international expertise, primarily the international organisation in the USA, Mandiant, which is working on the decryption process.  It is a world leader in malware and ransomware recovery.  It has been working with us since the cyberattack.  There are costs across a range of providers.<\/p> <p>  We will have to incur costs in the future, considering the scale and size of our networks.  I worked on networks previously in different organisations.  Many organisations have a 24-hour monitoring centre, sometimes called a service operation centre or network operation centre.  Due to the scale of the network, we will need to put in place a security operation centre to monitor our network much more comprehensively for 24 hours.  We will take the opportunity to update many of our Microsoft applications to Microsoft 365 and a significant cost will be associated with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Reid estimate the costs to be approximately &euro;500 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#C00400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The immediate costs are well over &euro;100 million, including capital and revenue costs, just to get through this.

We do not have figures for some of the clinical costs, service recovery, better local IT security, and strengthened resources, capacity and capability across our organisation.  In the short to medium term, it will cost significantly over &euro;100 million to get through this process and we are working on the medium and longer-term impacts.  It is clear, if one looks back at the previous three years, that we invested approximately &euro;82 million in malware and security protection, and a number of associated actions.  We have an old legacy network in the HSE.  It needs investment for security and protection of data in the future.

There will be two more weeks of more than 300,000.  In July, based on the national immunisation advisory committee's, NIAC, recommendations on what vaccines we can utilise with which age cohorts, we are down to just Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines, unless and until there is a change regarding the use of Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines.  It would mean that our supply for July would revert back to what had been the projected levels of approximately 190,000 from Pfizer and some from Moderna, coming to just over 200,000 per week and approximately 840,000 for July.<\/p><p>The latter is what was projected and committed to.

As GPs do not have access to diagnostics, people are either presenting themselves or are being referred.  We have noted a much higher rate of ambulatory care in that people are being discharged home from the emergency department.  While attendances have gone up, the admission rate has not changed hugely in many sites.  Prior to the cyberattack, the patient flow was much improved.  We had seen an increase, but because of the some of the capacity the Deputy referenced earlier in terms of our hospital avoidance measures and egress options, we have seen the lowest ever rate of delayed discharges.  There are number of things that were working very well that have been impacted by the cyberattack.  We are seeing longer lengths of stay in hospitals and greater numbers of attendances.

I accept Mr. Reid's point that health services staff have been through a very difficult time and have gone above and beyond the call of duty.  It is unbelievable what those on the front line and elsewhere in the health service have done over the past while.  It would be wise if the emergency department task force met as soon as is possible notwithstanding all of the other challenges.  If there is a particular problem in some hospitals, whatever the reason, it would be useful if the task force were to meet.<\/p> <p>  I have two more questions for Mr. Reid.  The first is in regard to student nurses and midwives in placements.  There was a commitment to pay them &euro;100 and that was to be backdated.  My understanding, having engaged with the INMO, is that not all students have been paid.  I do not know if that is down to the cyberattack or if there is some other reason for it.  Whatever the reason, voluntary hospitals appear to be more on top of making the payments than is the case with acute hospitals run by the HSE.<\/p><p>I ask Mr. Reid to respond to that.<\/p><p> Mr. Reid gave figures earlier for the vaccine roll-out.  We all welcome that more people are getting vaccinated, which is really good news.  The harm associated with Covid is significantly reducing because of the vaccine roll-out, which is something we should all celebrate.  Mr. Reid spoke about the supply of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines over the coming months.  I ask him to give us the figures for the Janssen vaccine.  The last time Mr. Reid appeared before the committee, the Minister had said that the worst-case scenario for June was about 60,000 doses of the Janssen vaccine, with the best-case scenario being 230,000.  My understanding is we might have got about 70,000.  We were expecting very significant amounts of the Janssen vaccine in July.  Again, my understanding is that will be at the lower end of the expectation.  We know the Janssen vaccine is also being made available to pharmacists.  I ask Mr. Reid to give us the breakdown on the Janssen vaccine and to outline the status of payments to student nurses and midwives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#D01700","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>On the first item, I will take that away.

As Mr. Reid said, the original forecast in June was for approximately 470,000.

The email states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDear John, <br \/><br \/>I'm emailing while lying in a hospital bed in a maternity hospital, not at all where I want to be, but unfortunately, I'm experiencing some pregnancy complications and require hospital care and monitoring.

How many hospitals are not complying with this?  The Minister is getting all the flak for this.  Much of the content of the emails is directed personally at him.

I will make a brief comment on his opening comments about vaccines.  We certainly are in a much stronger position than we could have expected in terms of the benefits we are seeing from the vaccination programme, both in reduced hospitalisations and visits to ICU.  As of last night, we had 39 hospitalisations, of whom 13 were in ICU.  Contrast that with the dark days of January when there were 2,020 in hospital and 212 people in ICU.  We are seeing the benefits, including in the public mood.<\/p> <p>  Our experience and that of the public is that every time we think we are ahead of the virus, whether that was last summer or Christmas, it has a tendency to bite back.  The immediate concern is the Delta variant.  We are seeing in the percentage rise in cases, not just in Ireland but in European countries and cities, a very prevalent surge in the Delta variant.  There is no reason to expect that Ireland will be any different or that we will not see a surge in Delta variant cases.  That is a trend we are beginning to see and it is a concern.  Notwithstanding that, we are in a much stronger position than we might have expected.<\/p> <p>  On vaccines for the 60 to 69 years cohort, we take all of our administration of vaccines guidance from the national immunisation advisory committee.  It gives guidance to the CMO who makes recommendations to the Government and we comply with all of that.  In fairness to NIAC, it takes the best world evidence and monitors that carefully daily and weekly.  It continues to do that.  The guidance and advice at that stage was that AstraZenica was suitable to be administered to people above the ages of 50.  The risks that were prevalent at that stage were to population ages below that.  That was the process then.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the timeframe, it had been, if the Deputy recalls, the administration of a second dose was moved from 12 weeks to 16 weeks.  That interval has now moved back to eight weeks.  We have a programme in place whereby last week alone, almost 100,000 people were given their second dose of AstraZenica.  This applies to about 450,000 people in total.  The process will be accelerated and instead of a nine-week programme, it will be a five-week programme.  Everybody in all the age groups that received AstraZenica should have received the second dose by the week commencing 19 July.  That accelerates the process and we will increasingly see people in the 60 to 69 years cohort.  We are vaccinating by age so the vast majority of the people who received the second dose last week should have been in that age cohort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>On the opening of the economy on 5 July, we could soon have large numbers of unvaccinated young people who work in hospitality working in an indoor environment.

After every wave of this virus, we have suffered significant impacts not only on Covid care, but on the care services we provide more widely.  Our concerns relate to sickness, illness, hospitalisations and their impact.  There is certainly evidence emerging from Public Health England demonstrating the impact of the variant, particularly on those people who have not been vaccinated or who have not been fully vaccinated.  The HSE has two key messages.  The first is that we want to monitor things closely because we cannot let what happened in January happen again, where hospitalisations reached over 2,000 and when more than 200 people were in our ICUs.  This had an impact on an already exhausted healthcare staff.  That is what we in the HSE will be watching.

I have questions on three areas, namely, third level students, children with cancer, and maternity restrictions, which I am sure the witnesses will receive further questions on after I conclude.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the vaccination of third level students in August and September.  I have been contacted by a number of students who are going abroad either on the Erasmus programme or for international studies.  Some of the institutions they are going to have said that the students cannot attend unless they can prove they have been vaccinated, otherwise they will not be able to attend on-campus.  Are there plans for those students?  It is not an enormous cohort but there will be a number of students who, having paid and are ready, will not be able to go abroad or will have to delay going because they will not be vaccinated in time.  Has any thought been given to that situation?<\/p> <p>  I have a second question for Mr. McCallion in relation to children with cancer.  Children with cancer and their parents are still waiting to hear when vaccines will be made available to children aged 12 to 15.  I know the Pfizer vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, but there has been no word yet from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, on this.  We are waiting on NIAC to give the go ahead.  Has the HSE given any consideration on how it will prioritise these high-risk patients in that age group, because they have been isolating for a long time and, obviously, the parents are extremely concerned about their children.  I will throw all my questions out and the witnesses can do as they will with them.<\/p> <p>  On the maternity restrictions, why are the risk assessments not publicly accessible despite the calls from Dr. Peter McKenna in April, and the HSE in May, to make them public?  Is there any further information as to why these risk assessments are not available?  On 10 May, Dr. Tony Holohan said that there should be a return to pre-pandemic partner access.  There still seems to be mixed messages on when that will happen.  Do the witnesses know when that is going to happen, whether it will be in the coming months or weeks?<\/p> <p>  The vaccination levels among maternity unit staff, and pregnant people and partners will affect restrictions.  Obviously, vaccination levels are extremely high among maternity staff and levels are climbing among pregnant people and their partners.  What is the current position of the HSE on the risk associated with partner attendance in maternity units, where other public health guidelines, such as social distancing and the wearing of personal protective equipment, are taken into account?  There was reference made in the guidelines that partners could not be allowed in for privacy reasons, I am sure the witnesses are aware of this.  That was never a reason in pre-pandemic times.  Therefore, why has privacy suddenly started to be referred to as a reason that pregnant peoples' partners need to be kept away from certain things, when that was not the case before the pandemic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#H00700","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I will make a few comments and they pass to my colleagues, Mr. McCallion and Dr. Henry.  On the first issue of third level students and their vaccination, it is worth reminding members of the committee and ourselves that the whole approach, in terms of the vaccination programme, has been to vaccinate those who are most vulnerable first, and it is working.  We started to programme based on NIAC advice, which was starting with residents and staff in long-term care facilities, moving on to healthcare workers, then people over the higher age groups and, indeed, medically vulnerable groups.  We should remain confident that this was the correct approach, that is what is working for Ireland and working for our vaccination programme.  There have been many calls throughout the programme to date, at the very early stages, the middle stages and now, to look to different groups at different stages.  We take our absolute advice, guidance and direction from NIAC and through the Chief Medical Officer and Government policy.  I reiterate that is has worked, it is working, and we should continue with it based on the process of working through the age groups.  It is based on limited supply and if we had a full supply, we would love to vaccinate all age cohorts together, but we must stick with what is working, and that is my very strong message to the committee.  I will pass to my colleague, Dr. Henry, on the visits question, and then to Mr. McCallion, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>We want to restore to the pre-pandemic levels but, as I said earlier, we are mindful of the particular risks in pregnancy and the evolving data, including that from the UK obstetric surveillance system, in March 2021, which looked at stillbirth rates.

We are in the happy position where we can release those incrementally.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hoey referred to the privacy issue.  Generally speaking, when women were in labour pre-pandemic, they had partners with them on the labour ward, but it was not always the case for a woman who may have been in suspect early-labour and was returned to a multi-occupancy antenatal ward, to have their partners in there, to give respect to other patients on the ward.  There is some degree of misunderstanding of what prevailed before the pandemic began.  As I said earlier, in response to one of the Senator's colleagues' question, we are now moving beyond those four areas.

If we can vaccinate a large group quickly, we have found that to be nearly as effective as trying to isolate numbers and then trying to extract those.  We look at all of those factors before we come up with a plan.  We are doing that planning through our planning team and national immunisation office, in parallel with the work going with NIAC on looking at the evidence and so on in terms of vaccinating, so that if a recommendation comes from NIAC, we have assessed the options and looked at the best way to do it.

I mentioned to Deputy Crowe's colleagues earlier that the most recent review this week is expanding beyond those four areas which are listed in the opening statement to additional areas.<\/p> <p>  We issued guidance.  We contacted all the hospitals.  There is, as has been mentioned, some variation based on infrastructure, which is understandable.  Some of these maternity units are quite old, with infrastructure which corresponds to another age when it comes to ideal infection prevention control measures.

I will not repeat them again because I have stated them to the Deputy's colleagues.  We then follow up through our operations, working with Ms O'Connor and her colleagues through all those 19 maternity units and marking them against compliance with the latest iteration of our visiting guidance.

In most cases, but not all, the person is good health, and that needs to be stressed.<\/p> <p>  There are situations in which a maternity hospital is co-located with a medical hospital and there are complexities with that.

For instance, yesterday I heard of someone being advised to go to Northern Ireland for a hip operation although the same facilities are available in a private hospital in Cork within 30 miles of where they live.  It may not be available in a public hospital because of the priorities that they are giving.

I will restate that we fully understand the stress that maternity visit restrictions has had on women and their partners and families.  We are doing everything possible to be as compassionate as we can while protecting young women and their babies as well.  That is the key driver for us and for all our clinical and medical teams across the country.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Henry will answer on specifics but we get returns from the 19 individual maternity hospitals on the implementation of the guidance document that Dr. Henry sent out nationally.  In fairness, I mentioned earlier that 16 of the 19 were fully compliant last Thursday.  The three that were not put in measures to be fully compliant for this week.  When I say a hospital is not compliant, it is not that those concerned are mischievously going out to be non-compliant.  They have certain conditions in their hospital where they find it difficult to find the risk balance between access and visits and infection prevention and control.  That is the rationale and the reason this happens.  <\/p> <p>  As for the waiting lists for surgery, with every wave we have, our waiting lists for people for various forms of surgery and elective care are affected.  The national service plan for this year has two funds, namely, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, of &euro;125 million and the access to care fund, which is about &euro;210 million.  We are working collaboratively with our colleagues in the Department of Health and with the Minister about an approach for the best use of those funds to address some of the waiting lists.  To be frank, it has been significantly impactful for us, particularly with the recent cyberattack.  It will involve a combination of using private capacity, using the NTPF, strengthening further capacity through the recruitment of consultants and other teams in our public hospitals and new ways of working that my colleague Ms Anne O'Connor has implemented during Covid, which involve many outpatient departments getting waiting lists in a very different way.  That will be the overall strategy we will agree with the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>The Deputy was asking if the hospitals make their own statements.

I compliment the staff members of the HSE on their work during the pandemic, particularly on the success of the vaccination programme which was always dependent on supply, as has been proven with the increased delivery of vaccines and the increase in patients who have been seen.<\/p> <p>  I am also going to touch on maternity services.  As others have said, we have been inundated with testimonies, which were sometimes heartbreaking, from expectant mothers, mothers who gave birth last year and some who have suffered heartbreaking situations where news around scans and anomalies was delivered in a very cold fashion because of Covid.  I will briefly read some testimony.  A lady called Stacey contacted me to say that partners are not visitors, fathers are not visitors and that she needs her husband to be there during labour and the post-natal period.  She asked that these restrictions be lifted, as this uncertainty is crippling.  Another lady, who lost a baby to stillbirth, wrote that not one more woman should ever have to walk the road she had walked alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00700","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I must interrupt Senator Kyne; he cannot really name people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00800","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>This woman went on to give a two-page testimony of giving birth, stillbirth, and all that went with it.  It was heartbreaking.  Another lady wrote how women and their partners are looking for a return to pre-pandemic levels of access through the pregnancy journey.  She queried the distinction between full labour and active labour and stated that women in labour need support and advocacy whether they are 1 cm, 4 cm or 10 cm dilated.  This is the whole point.  I have spoken to officials in Galway on this point of how you define labour.  Once a woman goes into a maternity hospital and presents to give birth, her partner should be there with them at all stages, as well as for 12-week and 20-week scans in particular.  They do not know what news they are going to get.  Where they get difficult news, they need to have their partner present, no ifs or buts.<\/p><p> I know that at times doctors can become immune to problems because they see so many of them, and I understand that, but women and their partners need to be together for these heartbreaking situations they have to go through where they receive bad news - and even where they do not receive bad news and the woman is just delivery a baby.  Even the normal, successful delivery of a child is an emotional roller coaster for women and their partners, and the latter need to be present.  We need to see that in place in all our maternity hospitals - no exceptions, no ifs and no buts.  Whatever has to be done to ensure that this happens needs to be done.  That is not a question; those are just comments based on testimony.  There has been enough uncertainty.  We have seen the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  As I said, the women need to have their partners present and need the support and love of a partner, whatever about good news, certainly in the case of bad news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#K00900","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624402800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I will go through the Senator's points.  I absolutely agree with him.  Our staff in the 19 maternity units want to be able to go back to a situation whereby partners can be full partners in every sense of the word during the whole process of childbirth, which, as the Senator says, is a difficult and anxious time.  It is mostly a happy time but sometimes, of course, as the Senator outlined, there are difficulties and bad news.  That is precisely why we are looking at this latest visitor guidance this week.  We are amending it to look at exactly those areas where there may be difficult news and particular anxiety, that is, those early pregnancy assessment units, people with high-risk pregnancies and people presenting in emergency situations in later pregnancy.  I mentioned earlier that nobody wanted to put in these restrictions but we were faced with overwhelming Covid disease and threat in January.  It threatened to destabilise our hospital system and, in fact, it did destabilise it.  There were multiple outbreaks in various settings.  Fifteen of those 19 units are co-located with general hospitals.  Those measures were put in place, as were the general visiting restriction measures, which also caused great distress to relatives and sick people in general hospitals and in nursing homes.  The measures were put in place in order to try to protect people as much as possible from the worst effects of this virus.  It is exactly those areas the Senator outlines that we are trying to focus on now as we return to some kind of normality.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned labour.  The practice has been, and the advice is very clear, that partners should be present in labour wards.  Sometimes women go back to antenatal wards after initial assessment.  Many of our units, which are not modern by any stretch of the imagination, are multiple occupancy wards and, as such, it was not the practice pre pandemic to have partners there constantly when other women occupy the wards.  What we are trying to standardise and to bring into practice, and what we have in those 19 units, is that a partner have every right to be present in the labour ward during labour.  What we are not able to commit to, however, based on the varying infrastructure of hospitals, is that people be present in the antenatal ward where it is a multiple occupancy ward because of the rights and privacy requirements of other women on that ward.<\/p> <p>  These are heartbreaking stories.  As I said, our staff, our working nurses and doctors, want to see pre-pandemic visiting practices return but they have had a very difficult few months themselves trying to keep women safe, to protect pregnancies and to protect women during what was certainly the worst surge of Covid-19 in January and February, during which we learned Covid is not without danger and risk to pregnancies and to women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Henry.  I accept the situation we were in post Christmas but we are in a much different situation now.  As I said, the heartbreaking testimonies we have seen over recent months cut to the core of life and death and expectant mothers' worry.  We therefore need to get back to whatever operated pre pandemic for expectant mothers.  They need to have that love and support of a partner for delivery and for scans.  Positive scans are fine, but you just do not know when you go in there what news you will get.  Again, reading the testimonies, where there is an anomaly, news may be delivered to women on their own, with no support.  They may be told to wait in a room or have to deliver news to their families in a car park.  It is unacceptable that that would be the way in which things operate in a hospital in this day and age.  I appreciate that Covid is the reason the restrictions are there, but for something as personal and as heartbreaking as this there needs to be a better system.  Cognisance needs to be taken of the delivery of the news and having partners there with the expectant mothers to provide that love and support and comfort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021062300002#L00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1624402800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I will follow on from that point about the maternity hospital visits.

I suppose what many members are looking for is possibly a more imaginative approach if at all possible, even if the partner were to use PPE or something coming in for that visit, that news or whatever else.

This was notwithstanding concerns they had about infection prevention and control and their infrastructure.  It is because of that ongoing questioning and interrogation and the direct advocacy and concerns of the women and partners involved that we are pushing hospitals to do whatever they can to comply with the guidance we have given out, which, as I said, is about recovering as quickly as we can to that pre-pandemic level.  I do not mean to labour the point but, as I said, and as the Chairman echoed, we are constantly balancing the risk.  We have found that Covid-19 is a very volatile virus in its impact on the population in healthcare settings.  The vaccination programme brings great additional protection to people and certainly has allowed us much greater freedom and has opened up choice for us in respect of visiting and other hospital services.
