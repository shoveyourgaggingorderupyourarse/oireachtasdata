I would like to clarify a number of points.  Deputy Whitmore's amendments were ruled out of order last week as they were outside the scope of the Bill.  I have never sought to hide the fact I worked for Arup and it is clearly stated on my LinkedIn profile.  Arup has somewhere in the region of 1,000 employees in Ireland and I never had anything to do with Arup's work on the proposed LNG plant.  I did not even become aware that Arup was working on this project until after I left the company.  Any suggestion of a conflict of interest on my part is, frankly, ridiculous.  The Green Party, including me, has campaigned vigorously against the import of fracked gas and LNG.  The Government recently published a clear and unambiguous statement on fracked gas and LNG, and it has also committed to working on an outright ban at EU level.<\/p><p>On the ruling of certain amendments out of order, in making these rulings I was acting on the advice of the Oireachtas officials and this advice is strictly in compliance with Standing Orders.

It is not pie in the sky stuff but pragmatic.  It is reasonable and has been included in Bills in other jurisdictions.  It is a practical way to start implementing the just transition, rather than just paying lip service to it.  If there is a legal requirement to include the impact a decision will have on communities, an impact assessment will have to be undertaken in advance, and this can inform mitigation measures that can be included.  At the previous meeting, the issue of just transition was the one we brought to a vote and that was for a reason.

I think that is the appropriate place to put that requirement.  As an indication of that commitment, work is starting in the midlands and three reports have to date been prepared by Kieran Mulvey.  It is the start of a much wider application of our delivery on that legislative commitment, as I said in our previous discussions, to look at how we can broaden that.  I refer also to the work being done by the National Economic and Social Council's secretariat and the extended period of social dialogue we will need in order to meet this objective.<\/p> <p>  The legislative requirement is clear.

The Minister stated that the principles of a just transition are contained in the Bill but they are absolutely not.  A just transition is referred to once in the entire Bill, and there is no definition of it or guidance as to what it means.  This is a golden opportunity to incorporate it fully into the Bill and ensure we will meet our targets in a fair manner.  I do not agree with the Minister that it has been incorporated.  One reference is not sufficient.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, the thing about a just transition is that we have to be proactive with it.  It cannot come after the actions and targets are in place.  A proactive, targeted and focused approach needs to be taken, and it cannot happen after the fact because it will not happen properly.  A reactive transition is not a good transition and it will not happen organically.  In order to ensure the transition is done in a fair and just manner, we need to plan for it, and this amendment sets out how that can happen.  If something cannot be measured, it cannot be addressed.  The first step that needs to be taken is there needs to be an active analysis of which sectors and communities will be impacted and how they will be impacted, with plans set out to ensure that their needs will be met and that the direction of every Government policy will not undermine the right of those communities and those workers to access a just transition.<\/p> <p>  This is a really important initiative.  The Minister has been referring frequently during this debate to the just transition commissioner in the midlands.  The work he is doing is valuable but it has to be broader than that.  Not just one specific area will be impacted but everyone will be.  I have just read in my local newspaper in Wicklow that one of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues is quoted as stating that the Bill should not impact on and undermine farmers in Wicklow.  The way to ensure that is to ensure a just transition because a just transition does not relate just to Bord na M&oacute;na workers but to the majority of our communities, and to farming communities as well.  For the farming community, analysis needs to be carried out on how the obligations that will arise out of us meeting our targets could impact on them and how we can ensure they are not negatively impacted.<\/p> <p>  The amendment is really important.   Despite the continuing references to them, two words in the Bill is not sufficient.

The amendment gives the impression that much of this change is avoidable and that we can start to assess in an academic way the impacts on different sectors.  It suggests that if we think they are too great, there is some way in which we can prevent them or insulate against them.  We have to have a dialogue of the sort the Minister has set out in the section.  We are talking about creating a vision of a different, albeit prosperous, future for many of these sectors, and we are in a position where there is an imperative to change.<\/p> <p>  The concept of a just transition goes through the Government's entire approach.  Under the heading, Mission: A Green New Deal, in the programme for Government, a just transition is set out in several sections, including a commitment to publishing a just transition plan and establishing a permanent commission for a just transition.  There is a recognition that a just transition will go to the core of the work here.  The section before us sets out that one of the conditions to which the Government and the Minister must have regard is the requirement for a just transition to a climate-neutral economy to maximise employment opportunities and to support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition.<\/p> <p>  It goes to the heart of the Bill to create an environment where we deliver change that, unfortunately, we do not have the choice of considering whether we will or will not deliver.  We have to make change but, more important, we have to create the vision of an alternative future that is prosperous for farmers.  If we wait and allow an environment to develop whereby people feel we can put off change until another day, we will do a disservice to those very sectors and communities we are trying to support.  The key is the dialogue the Minister underpins in the section, with the creation of a better and more prosperous sector if it is climate resilient and sustainable in its use of resources and has anticipated the negative impacts, and that that is supported by the just transition strategy set out in section 4(8)(k).  While I can sympathise with people feeling they are threatened, the process we are in has to be about divining that new future, not analysing where we are now and hoping we can in some way prevent change happening, or wholly compensate people for everything that might change in that environment.<\/p> <p>  This transition is unavoidable.  The tone of the alternative being offered, compared with what the Minister has set out, is too static.<\/p><p>It pretends we can stay where we are, take the time to reflect on many sectoral impacts and then decide whether to make change.  We are past that period.  The challenge is to work with communities to find this alternative future, which I am convinced is there.

County Offaly will bear the brunt of the greatest job losses, with 53% of all job losses in the midlands occurring in that county.  Not one job has been created.

In theory, we are working with communities; in practice, it is not happening on the ground.<\/p><p>Let us reflect on the record in respect of seasonal workers in Bord na M&oacute;na.  It was evident from the December before last that we would have a serious situation regarding those workers.  They still do not know what is going on, 18 months later.  How can there be a just transition when a key part of the workforce in Bord na M&oacute;na still does not know what is going on or what role it will play in this?  That is the litmus test.  <\/p><p>I accept the legislation sets out in section 4(8)(k):<\/p> <blockquote> \tthe requirement for a just transition to a climate neutral economy which endeavours, in so far as is practicable, to&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) maximise employment opportunities, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition; <\/blockquote> <p>I accept that principle is set out in the legislation.  However, section 4(8) states: &quot;For the purposes of performing their respective functions under this section, the Minister and the Government shall have regard to...&quot;.  Once the Minister and Government of the day has regard to a just transition and ticks that particular box, then they comply with this legislation.  We have a perverse situation in this legislation where there is no recourse to the D&aacute;il one it is enacted.  The Government of the day, once it ticks the box regarding just transition, can do whatever it likes.  That is not right.<\/p><p>The difficulty is as we have seen relates to rural-proofing.  Every memorandum that goes to Cabinet must be rural-proofed but that is a box-ticking exercise that takes place after the memo has been drafted.  When it goes to the Department of the Taoiseach, then and only then is it rural-proofed.  It is rural-proofed in name only, rather than in practice.  A litany of policy programmes have come forward since rural-proofing of all Cabinet memorandums came into place, which have had a devastating impact on rural communities.  Yet, such policies were rural-proofed.  The same applies to what is presented here.  Once the box-ticking exercise relating to just transition is complied with, the D&aacute;il has no role or function in this whatsoever.  It is wrong.  We will come to the D&aacute;il's function later and it should have a function and role in monitoring the enactment and implementation of this legislation.  As currently drafted, that is not there and I hope the Minister will make that small concession.  Biogenic methane should be treated as something very distinct and the broader issue tabled by this amendment should be accepted by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060800002#D00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>It is not just in the section to which I referred where there is a requirement to have regard to the just transition.

Similarly, right across the legislation in setting a climate strategy, we also have to have regard to European regulations which require us to show the socioeconomic strategy behind that climate strategy.  At every stage in the process, we must check to see if it meets our social as well as our environmental and economic objectives.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Nolan, I absolutely accept that we must be effective on the ground in delivering.

It has taken time to get the European state aid approval in some of those but that is done now and I expect a huge number of community projects to be up and running very quickly to help make the transition happen.  It will continue to evolve.  Further European funding will become available to support a just transition.  Offaly County Council, particularly, will work on disbursing those funds.  Critically, the next phase of the just transition process will engage with the likes of the National Economic and Social Council as to how we spread this approach, not only in the midlands but in other parts of the country.

I can understand Deputy Naughten saying that phrases such as \"have regard to\" would appear to offer Ministers the potential to disregard those were they not of a mood but that is clearly not the case when one puts into permanent statutory form a just transition commissioner, when one has a plan that sets it out and when one complements that with this Bill.  There is undoubtedly an obligation on any Minister that occupies the current Minister's position, to take a view of the same kind that we must endeavour, insofar as is practicable.  That is the highest bar that one ever sees in legislation, one never sees deliver because obviously there are restraints which Ministers must apply to so that they do everything that they could within their power.  That is what \"insofar as practicable\" means in legislative terms.  The combination of this Bill and the other Bill that is coming up the tracks provides the belt and braces that Deputies are looking for here.  One cannot put everything into this Bill.

While I fully accept the overall thrust behind the legislation and the need for it, in some ways I am envious of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, being able to get a Bill such as this through.  It is imperative, for all of the arguments that have been made by committee members during the previous two sessions and this morning, that there is recourse to the national Parliament on all of these targets and their implementation.<\/p><p>Deputies Whitmore, O'Rourke and Nolan spoke earlier about the need for a just transition.  That needs to be reflected in the implementation of this legislation.  However, there is no mechanism for the D&aacute;il to review its implementation on an ongoing basis.  There is a reporting mechanism back to the committee and provision for consideration and consultation with the committee but there is no formal ratification process once this legislation is enacted in terms of the five-year targets and, more importantly, with respect to the sectoral implementation plans.<\/p><p> The Chairman and his colleagues published a report last week on how we could reach a 51% reduction in transport emissions between now and 2030 and he is to be commended on that.  If, however, what the Government is saying and has consistently said in terms of agriculture is accurate, the 51% reduction in emissions within the transport sector falls far short of what will be required.  I do not know what the sectoral targets will be.  We should have that level of clarity before we enact this legislation but at a minimum, that should come back before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for ratification.  That is a specific provision in my later amendments, which we will consider when we reach them.  However, this amendment proposes that the climate plan would have to be formally adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This climate plan must take into account, as set out in the legislation, both the national planning framework and the national spatial strategy, both of which must be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, yet the climate plan does not have to be formally approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> We can talk about all the big bold measures we like but, realistically, we must bring the public and our citizens with us along that road if we are to turn around the challenge we face of global warming.  That is the one aspect of this debate that sadly has been lacking for a long time.  Legislating the National Parliament out of the approval and ratification process will further alienate the public, cause them to disengage and lead to reactions to measures, rather than people acting in solidarity to achieve the overall objective.  I ask the Minister and colleagues to support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060800002#L02000","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>This is a complex structure with many various parts.  We have to set an objective.  The advisory council sets out budgets as to how we will achieve that.  We will keep assessing them and reviewing it.  We set out a strategy to deliver on those budgets and a plan.  It is not only at the plan review stage the Oireachtas will have a critical role.  It will also have a role, as provided in section 6B(7) which states: \"Where a carbon budget is approved by the Government ... the Minister shall cause a copy of the carbon budget to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, which shall consider the carbon budget as soon as may be, and the carbon budget shall have effect from a date on which a motion approving the carbon budget has been passed by the second such House.\"  The section also states where the motion is not approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas under subsection (7), the Minister shall have to have a period of two months to go back on an iterative process of reviewing it.  One could consider any one element and say such and such is not provided for in the Bill but one must consider the entire process.  It is an integrated process in which the Oireachtas has a key role.  If we were to remove the role of the Government to approve the plan, I note there is a later amendment proposing that the Government needs to have more involvement.  This is a complicated structure but that structure is set out.  It involves a role for the advisory council, the Government and, critically, the Oireachtas not only in reviewing the annual report but in approving the carbon budget.  That is the appropriate place to give the Oireachtas the key intervention.  Therefore, I do not support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060800002#M00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister brought up the carbon budget, which I intended to address at a later stage but I will address it now.  I fully accept this is a very complex structure.  I also fully accept and do not dispute there are various elements of consultation involved in it with the Climate Change Advisory Council, the committee, the public and so forth.  However, the only ratification role D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has is in approving the 2025 carbon budget.  It has no role in the 2030 carbon budget and the draft of the 2035 carbon budget.  In a perverse drafting of this legislation, if D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the 2025 budget, the Minister can bring in whatever budget he or she likes after that within 60 days.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the carbon budget, it has no function or role regarding it.  It has no say whatsoever regarding the 2030 carbon budget, which is set in stone once this legislation is enacted, and it has the potential to amend the 2035 carbon budget.  However, at this stage we do not have the evidence to allow for us to amend that particular carbon budget, and that is the only role the D&aacute;il has.  If we reject it, we hand that power back to the Minister of the day regardless of what our objections are.  The Minister by presenting an alternative budget or the same budget again to Cabinet, will result in that budget automatically becoming law.<\/p> <p>  The D&aacute;il has no role whatsoever in ratifying the sectoral plans.  The Minister has given assurances regarding a just transition and I accept the sincerity with which they were given.  I full accept where he is coming from and I know his heart is in the right place in that regard, but the difficulty is that in five or ten years' time he may not be the Minister.  The Minister of the day may have a very different perspective.  We could have a Minister in office at that stage who is a climate change denier.  Such a Minister could effectively implement whatever he or she so wishes.  If the D&aacute;il rejects it, the Minister can bring in whatever he or she likes within 60 days and it automatically becomes law.  That is wrong.  The National Parliament must be involved in the approval of this.  Last week many colleagues engaged in heated debate on legislation on the health provision regarding Covid.  People argued the D&aacute;il should have a role in reviewing it.  We cannot argue that the D&aacute;il should have a role in reviewing those restrictions when in this legislation we are effectively giving a blank cheque to the Minister of the day to do whatever he or she wants - to divide up this carbon budget in whichever way he or she wants.  It is imperative there is a ratification process which must be either accepted or rejected by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann without any caveats that if we reject it, we have no further say in it.

Yet research conducted in countries around the world has consistently documented the negative impact of school bullying, especially on victims.  It can get under the skin and affect neuro-biological functioning.   Victims are at risk for depression, anxiety, and poor self-worth, challenges that often continue into adulthood.   They are more likely to consider suicide.  Far too many have found suicide to be their only option.   They at risk for later aggression, conduct problems and self-harm.  Understandably, victims are more disengaged from school and are more likely to be absent.   Academic performance suffers, and they are more likely to drop out of school early.   Children who bully others are also at risk for many of the same problems, but especially for aggressive and antisocial behaviour and delinquency, substance use, depression and anxiety.  Bullying can also become a generalised pattern of behaviour, with demonstrated links to later dating violence and criminality.   Even children who witness bullying are at risk, with evidence of feelings of helplessness, mental health difficulties, and suicidal ideation.   Given such evidence, it is critical that we address school bullying and I applaud the committee's efforts to do so but how can it be done?<\/p> <p>  Bullying is developmental.   It increases over the primary years, reaching a peak around grades eight to ten, and declines somewhat thereafter but never goes away.   As such, schools are an ideal place to address the problem, where we can reach the majority of our children early on and repeatedly.   Bullying is also context dependent.  The overall climate and social atmosphere of the school can either encourage or discourage bullying.   Indeed, certain subgroups are far more likely to be bullied, including racial and sexual minorities, immigrant youth and those with disabilities.  Bullying emerges within very complex social networks, with social status being a key motivating factor.   Educators need training to understand the group dynamics that underlie bullying and how they can best support vulnerable students.   Until recently, teacher education programmes have not provided such training, focusing primarily on academics.  <\/p> <p>  To date, several school-based programmes have been created that show some success in reducing bullying.  Although they share common elements, the diversity of approaches is important, each addressing particular contributing factors.  Still, there is no single programme that has been shown to stop school bullying.  Overall, research shows that school efforts to reduce bullying only does so by about 20%, with little evidence of effectiveness at the secondary level.  We can do better.  <\/p> <p>  Universal programmes aimed at all children are critical to develop pro-social behaviours and positive school cultures but they are not enough.  Given the documented consequences of bullying, we also need more targeted one-on-one interventions for those students who are most seriously impacted.  Indeed, the most effective programmes have been shown to be whole-school efforts with multiple foci, including both universal and targeted interventions.  My recommendation is that anti-bullying efforts be viewed as part of a larger mandate for schools and that schools promote social and emotional competencies, as well as academic skills.  In North America, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the positive, long-term impact of such programmes.  They teach basic pro-social skills, foster empathy, and promote acceptance and respect for others, thereby creating tolerant and inclusive classrooms.  These programmes not only reduce peer aggression and victimisation but help to create positive school climates that will not exacerbate the difficulties victimised students face.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, there are multiple ways through which educators can do this, allowing for flexibility and repetition with variation across the school years.<\/p><p>To address bullying effectively, we need to provide educators with the training they need.  Expanded training for counsellors is also needed for them to undertake targeted interventions and also to create better links to community-based mental health agencies.  Finally, ongoing assessment and evaluation are imperative to be sure that one's efforts are actually working. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Shelley Hymel","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Dr. Downes has joined us again.

Let us be clear, bullying is an issue that can cause anxiety, depression and self-harm and can impact on physical health.  It is also an adverse childhood experience.  It requires serious, sustained emotional counselling and therapeutic supports in schools, which we do not have in Ireland.  We need those supports at both primary and post-primary levels.  International research also highlights the point that victims of bullying tend to engage in cycles of self-blame, self-hate and a sense of hopelessness and fatalism.  We need to stop these cycles of despair early, with early intervention, through these emotional counselling and therapeutic supports.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of family dimensions, which is neglected in many policy aspects, I draw the members' attention to a systematic review undertaken by Lereya <i>et al.<\/i>of over 70 studies that indicate that negative parenting practices, destructive communication practices and violence in the home have an impact on bullying engagement.  Therefore we need to look at the family support services that I mentioned in respect of bullying.  International research also points to the significant importance of having interventions which are not only whole-school in their approach but also involve parents.  For example, Professor Donna Cross's work in Australia has highlighted the additional benefit of working with parents and not only taking a whole-school approach.  <br\/><br\/>On the issue of peer defenders or challengers, our report for the European Commission highlights a range of legal and psychological concerns with the active bystander approach, which encourages bystanders to actively stand up to the bully.  It is concerning from a legal perspective because it is reasonably foreseeable that the bully may retaliate against that peer defender or challenger, which puts them at risk of being bullied, with all the various long-term impacts associated with that.  Our report therefore highlights that it would be negligent to put schools in a position where they would be actively encouraging students to intervene as peer defenders.  That is not to undermine all of the excellent work on peer supports and student voices regarding bullying.  However, on that aspect, our report criticises the psychological focus.  There are many motivations that can explain why somebody may be a bullying perpetrator.  We cannot just assume that the esteem of the group is the only dimension to that.  There may also be long-term trauma and adverse child experiences for the perpetrator.  As Sourander's longitudinal study emphasised, an entrenched bullying perpetrator is a red flag that something is wrong.  Again that is an argument in favour of early intervention and the provision of emotional counselling and therapeutic support for the perpetrator.<br\/><br\/>Our report to the Commission emphasises the importance of the establishment of a national co-ordinating committee to drive these issues at a national level.  At a school level, a driving committee that is led by a champion is required.  It is notable that our own research of 2017 found that more than half of primary and secondary schools did not have a teacher designated as a champion to lead a whole-school bullying initiative, even though they were requested to do so by the bullying procedures.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I now invite Professor Cefai to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#B00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>There is growing recognition of social and emotional education as an aggression and bullying prevention strategy, contributing to a positive school culture where bullying is neither acceptable nor rewarding in any way.  The term \"social and emotional education\" refers to what we sometimes call life skills or soft skills.  In Ireland, I believe that it is referred to as social, personal and health education, SPHE.  It includes competences such as developing a positive healthy identity, managing emotions and achieving goals, solving problems effectively, feeling and showing empathy for others, establishing and maintaining healthy relationships, working with others as part of a team, resolving conflicts constructively and making responsible and ethical decisions.<\/p> <p>  There is strong international evidence that these competences learned at school, when supported by contextual processes, are key for personal development to challenge a culture of violence and bullying in schools.  We have research evidence, including a report which we produced for the European Commission, which shows that social and emotional education leads to decreased antisocial behaviours such as aggression, bullying, delinquency; decreased emotional distress, such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation; enhanced positive mental health and resilience; increased positive attitudes towards self and others; prosocial behaviour, such as sharing and collaboration; and improved academic achievement.<\/p> <p>  Together with my colleague, Dr. Paul Downes, and two other colleagues, we have developed a European framework on the basis of international literature on how social and emotional education may be effectively integrated in schools to promote positive development and mental health.  The whole-school systemic framework that we proposed underlines various processes which need to be in place for social and emotional education to have an impact on positive student outcomes.<\/p> <p>  In the limited time I have, I will briefly describe and make recommendations on two aspects of this framework.  First, there must be a curricular focus on social and emotional education, which includes direct instruction of social and emotional competences as a core content area on the timetable.  Of course, that resonates with, and relates to, SPHE in Ireland.  It also includes a transversal approach in which the social and emotional competences are embedded into the academic subjects, such as art, PE, science and language.  This focus mobilises the students&rsquo; psychological resources to challenge a culture of violence and bullying in school, with children less likely to be engaged or involved in bullying.  The curriculum needs to be in place from the early years up to high school level, adapted according to the local context, with an explicit focus on bullying intervention.<\/p> <p>  My first recommendation is that we need to bring social and emotional education to the fore of educational systems.  Often it finds itself in the background.  It needs to be brought in across all year groups, with sufficient time allocated to it on the timetable.  It is necessary to review whether, across the whole range of year groups, we need to increase the time dedicated to social and emotional education.<\/p> <p>  My second recommendation concerns the positive school climate, to which I previously referred.  This climate gives students the opportunity to observe social and emotional competences being practised  by adults and peers and to apply these skills themselves in the classroom in their learning and behaviour.  In such a climate, students feel safe and secure, they have a sense of belonging, understand and respect each other, empathise with the thoughts and feelings of others, build knowledge together, support and care for each other, resolve conflict constructively and make decisions responsibly.<\/p><p>It is difficult for bullying to thrive in such a context.<\/p><p> The teachers' own attitudes and behaviour serve as powerful role models in this respect.  For instance, it is important that teachers in their classroom management do not rely heavily on punitive coercive measures and do not bully or humiliate students themselves.  For instance, research shows us that bullying tends to be higher in schools where classroom teachers use authoritarian approaches and inflexible classroom management or where they are perceived by the students as being biased against particular groups of students.  This requires, however, that all teachers need to be adequately trained not only in teaching and implementing socio-emotional education but also in developing their own socio-emotional competences.  This is not just about social, personal and health education, SPHE, specialist teachers but about all teachers across the curriculum.  They need to have the competences to regulate their emotions, to work on their own biases and prejudices, to be empathetic, to embrace diversity, to work as part of a team with others, colleagues, parents and children, to resolve conflicts constructively, and to engage in instructional and restorative classroom management.<\/p><p> My second recommendation, therefore, is about teacher training, which is that we need to start at initial teacher education supported by continuing professional learning.  Teacher training programmes in higher education institutions need to include a competence framework that outlines the key competences teachers need to have to implement socio-emotional education effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Carmel Cefai","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Downes, Professor Hymel and Professor Cefai, and my apologies for any mispronunciations.  What we are talking about is, I believe, straightforward, concerns best practice, which is contained within this European framework, and it is a matter of putting it into play.  Within this State, could we do with a greater amount of gathering and monitoring of incidents of bullying just to see the particular type we are dealing with, whether that is based on gender, sexual orientation, race, family circumstances and probably many other types I have not even considered?  We then build that into what we need in respect of social and emotional education, particularly if that is SPHE.  Beyond that we need to ensure we include children, parents and teachers in that.  It is obviously vital young people are included in this part of the conversation.<\/p> <p>  A big issue for me with bullying is that we all understand the outworkings and how terrible it can be for particular children, and it can have a lifelong impact.  We also get scenarios where people transfer between being a bully and being bullied.  I got an understanding of what cognitive dissonance means, which is the idea that if I bully the other kid, I am not a bad person and I do it because he or she deserves it and it is not very serious in any event.  From the other end it is a case that they bully me and do so because I deserve it.  I imagine it is vital that that idea is built into any training programme and that people understand this, especially for parents, because parents are always afraid in the first instance that their children are being bullied and then that their child is engaged in bullying activity, which can happen to anybody.

Research has been done and teachers and schools seem to be most concerned about physical and cyberbullying.  In fact what children tell us is the commonest types of bullying are much more subtle.  These are the social and relational types of bullying, the teasing etc.  These are difficult because they are in a kind of grey zone.  Teachers do not know if the children are teasing each other for fun or if they are really trying to publicly humiliate people.  It is useful to identify those but to target specific programmes at them does not seem to be critical.  We have to do the larger picture of trying to stop the whole thing.<\/p> <p>  As to the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on how children think, we know that children who bully others do something that is now being dubbed as moral disengagement.  They justify and rationalise that behaviour.

It is important to note that bullying is not a static phenomenon in a school.  It can change over the school year.  I would very much encourage school-based surveys.  I have come across situations of surveys where you could have three fourth class groups, for example, one of which with very significant bullying issues and the other two without any significant issues at all.

Professor Hymel was in fact saying research shows us children&rsquo;s understanding of bullying is not always the same as others' understanding of bullying.  One way of working around that is the importance of including children in any exercise in identification of the conditions that are contributing to bullying and the sense that they make of those situations.  Children should be included in bullying interventions both in terms of the resources and the types of activities.  Research is very much showing that children are more likely to be engaged in resources where fellow children have been involved in co-creating.  Research shows children can provide us with very useful insights and materials on how to deal with and overcome bullying and we need to give them a say on the way forward in the initiatives we have to do.

From our report for the European Commission, we emphasise that a number of good practices have been found to be more effective and others which are less likely to engage parents.  Within a whole-school approach where we include all of the parents, there also needs to be a particular focus on the selected preventative approaches.  Those families and those parents where bullying is taking place or where their children have been engaged in bullying need to have a particular focus in our approaches.<\/p> <p>  Second, research shows very clearly that when we just provide information in a talk-down approach, those parents who we especially need to engage with do not engage with us.  We need to take an approach which is very much a sharing of our thoughts and resources together and to focus both on capacity building of the parents such as through parental education but also, and this is a very important part, to do it in an empowering rather than a talk-down way.

Part of the answer to that is a simple matter of getting them to understand what they did and how it impacted on other people.  I tend to think of children as being in the process of developing morals and we have to help them through that process.  Frankly, we do not have a lot of opportunities to do that because it is usually left to the family or the religion.  Families are busy, often with both parents working, and religion is on the decline.  The problem is being pushed into schools and the schools are just learning how to deal with it.  There needs to be more work done to help us figure out how to deal with this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Shelley Hymel"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>That is interesting.

There may be negative experiences within the home that are obviously being reflected in the child's behaviour.  If much of the education that needs to happen must take place at an early stage, do we need to ask whether it is possible to transform parental attitudes?

There are children whose parents have done everything right, but those children have, in effect, found out they can get what they want if they push other kids around.

Some of the research seems to assume there is but, in fact, there are many different reasons for such behaviour.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the Senator's point about disengagement, I would point to the capacity to connect.  If we have children who have experienced trauma, then their emotions are frozen because they are holding back and repressing those emotions.  That is when specialist intensive supports are needed, to allow them to connect first with themselves, as a dimension of their connecting with, and having empathy for, others.  There is a cohort for whom a cognitive message about being nice to everyone will not register because their emotions are frozen due to trauma-related dimensions.  There may also be issues around separation anxiety and early-years attachment that are quite deep-seated aspects, as recognised by development psychology, that relate to the formation of empathy.<\/p> <p>  Another point I want to make is that when I argue for restorative practice, it is important to differentiate that from restorative justice.  Restorative justice is where the offender and victim - in this case, the bullying perpetrator and the victim of bullying - would come together to confront each other in some way and make peace.  I am not advocating that in respect of bullying.  Restorative practice is a different set of competencies.  It is a way of questioning things whereby the person reflects on his or her behaviour and is helped to work out how he or she may be causing harm to others.  It is a way of getting people to reflect on how they might change their patterns of thoughts, emotions and behaviours in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>My final question is to Professor Hymel, although it may be relevant to all the witnesses because it is a general question in a way.  The more I have learned in recent weeks about the diversity of pretexts, means and contexts for bullying and the diversity of approaches to dealing with it, I am struck by a particular point.  We live in a time when there is very much a focus on identity, whether that identity is sexual, racial, disability-based and so on.  There are programmes that focus on particular pretexts for bullying.  However, the more I learn about all of this, the more I wonder whether it is a mistake to focus on one area.  Does such an approach risk hogging time and resources and playing down, even by implication, other kinds of bullying?  Could it appear to \"other\" certain categories of people whose experience is not being reflected because there is a focus on one kind of bullying?  Might it be better to reach for some kind of higher ground that seeks to be inclusive of everybody and always keeps every kind of bullying in context?  There may be particular interest groups that want to specify particular types of bullying, and they may have good reason to do so, but are there risks inherent in focusing on specific identities when trying to combat and prevent bullying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#E00600","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I think we can do both.

Alongside that, it is important to include examples that relate to particular types of bullying.  We do not keep it at a general level.  The approach should include all children, including those who are at risk and those who are not.  In this way, we are being inclusive.<\/p> <p>  Within this inclusive approach, however, there is a need for what we call proportionate universality.  We address the whole group inclusively but we give examples, within the activities for the whole classroom, that relate to particular students who may be more at risk because of, for instance, gender or disability.  I would start from there.  We need to focus more, to begin with, on a universal preventative approach.  However, research shows this may not be enough because children who are at risk or already victims of bullying may need additional support, including at a preventative level.

Some of them have stated publicly that they see their role as referring on to the specialist services at that level.  We need to distinguish between the two levels - the guidance counsellors who lead whole-school bullying initiatives at the universal level of a school, and those who provide specialist, intensive one-to-one support.  I am not in favour of the provision of this kind of one-to-one support by those who are not qualified therapists.

Guidance counsellors do not have a central role in many of the prevention and intervention programmes.  I would argue that the Deputy is proposing a half-baked Irish solution to an Irish problem.  I am not saying that an individual guidance counsellor could not lead and be the champion for a whole-school co-ordinating committee - there may be some who would be very good in that role, and there may be others who would not - but a lot depends on how we conceive of the composition of a driving committee at whole-school level.

In Canada, at least, the counsellors are completely stretched.  They have way too many clients and not many kids go to them.  Kids go to the person they trust.  My experience is that if they go to anybody, it is a peer or a person in school such as their teacher, if they have the trust with the teacher.  It has to be done at many levels.  One counsellor with 2,000 kids will find it very difficult to satisfy that need.  We have several problems.  Teachers will also be at the front line.

It is about trying to get in earlier with the social and emotional education and softer parenting programme approaches.  It could include a range of health-based issues such as sleep-awareness issues or a range of other dimensions.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that there needs to be different sites of engagement, such as community locations, where families may feel more at ease and where there is a social element, as well as the family centre dimension, where programmes can be run.  There should be community outreach, school outreach into the home and outreach to individual families.  There are home-visiting programmes, both for early years children and at primary school level, whereby there are visits to the homes of families where there are known to be major issues of mental health, domestic violence or conflict.<\/p> <p>  We need to have that multidimensional outreach approach but it should be more than just an information-based model.  It is also about how parents may co-construct some of the solutions.

We need a vision for extracurricular activities, after-school projects, meaningful sports, the arts and nature and to channel people's energies in other directions.  This is linked to the discriminatory bullying I mentioned.  Research in the area of social psychology highlights that it is not enough just to have contact with people to overcome prejudice or discrimination.  Contact and structured co-operation are required.  It is about structured co-operative tasks.  The online environment is so unstructured in many ways that it facilitates that sense of mutual antagonism.  As part of a revitalisation of our society, we need to integrate arts and sport, which are individually strong in many ways, with a social and emotional education.

To revisit some of the issues that have been raised, I get the idea that any interventions need to take place as soon as possible, as is true in most other areas.  I really welcome the commentary suggesting that multiple sites must be picked and this anti-bullying framework built into everything as opposed to asking parents to come in and telling them their kid is the main problem with regard to bullying, to use the example given.  That is obviously a major issue.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of community-based programmes.  The example in County Louth to which I probably halfway alluded is the Genesis programme, with which I have a familial connection, to put that on the record.  This service operates parenting programmes for the parents of children of varying ages, starting from the very young.  It also operates the KiVa anti-bullying programme.  It runs stuff in the community and programmes connected to the schools.  That serves a really good purpose but a certain cohort is missed.  The witnesses spoke earlier about people who suffer multiple adverse childhood experiences.  We are possibly talking about multigenerational issues or abuse connected with poverty along with many other issues.  There is a wider piece of work to be done there.  A holistic set of interventions with particular families is required.  This probably means starting when kids are very young and dealing with a lot more than just the very specific issue of bullying.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, the witnesses have laid out quite well the sort of framework at which we are looking with regard to best practice.  Can resilience be built in?  As much as we want to deal with the problem of bullying and as much as we need to address it and prevent it happening, it will still happen and we need to help kids protect themselves.  We talked about social media and the amount of time people spend on these platforms.  We are in a world in which people are not doing what they did 20 or 30 years ago, which is to go out and interact with their peers.  There were good and bad points.  People fell out with each other and had fights but learned how to get over it.  To a degree, those skill sets are just not as readily available to kids these days.

I served on its committee for a while so I know it pretty well.  The area-based childhood programmes present a great opportunity.  They represent a key underutilised lens for a community vision on bullying, as do the local area partnerships.  I firmly encourage the committee to make some recommendation in this regard.  Many of these have already been developing social and emotional education initiatives.  They tend to focus on the younger years while a lot is also needed for adolescents.  The scope of some of these groups does not stretch to the adolescents in their remit.  It is certainly a structure.  There are the area-based childhood, ABC, initiatives.  That is a community-based structure which has great potential.<\/p> <p>  With particular regard to KiVa, in our formal submission to the committee we raised concern with particular regard to the peer defenders aspect of KiVa.  It is questionable both legally and psychologically.  Those are aspects to be considered.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point on resilience, Professor Cefai may disagree with me but I am concerned about some of the discourse around resilience because it risks blaming children who are suffering for supposedly not being sufficiently resilient.  I do not believe we need to make Teflon children or children who are superheroes in the midst of adversity.  I personally prefer the term \"agency\".  We want to enable children to respond actively to situations.  We need to create inclusive systems around them to facilitate their agency.  One part of resilience, if I was to be committed to use the term, is stopping the cycles of self-hate.  International research shows that victims blame themselves.  They internalise the logic of the perpetrator, feel hopeless and engage in patterns of fatalism, which is associated with risk behaviour.  Stopping those cycles of despair, self-blame and self-hate is a key dimension.  Intensive supports are needed to do that but universal competences may also be involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Downes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>We have a problem in that we are just beginning to understand how this bullying and victimisation gets under the skin.  To give an example, several studies have shown that kids who are victimised by peers or more generally show a blunted cortisol response.  Their body changes.  We exert cortisol for that fight or flight response under conditions of stress but kids who have been victimised do not.  They exert less cortisol.  This is only seen in victims of the Holocaust or repeated rape.  It is a very major factor.  If we want to create resilience, we really have to start thinking about the impact of bullying in making kids less resilient and how we can compensate for that.  We do not have answers to that question yet.  We are just beginning to uncover how difficult that may be for the child who is repeatedly victimised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Shelley Hymel"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I would start with an inclusive approach where children at risk of bullying or already bullied would also benefit from general socio-emotional skills such as self-regulation and developing a positive self-concept.  That is an important point.  We are trying to create a context where bullying cannot thrive.  However, until we reach the ideal situation where bullying does not exist, we need to provide additional targeted supports for those at risk of being bullied in terms of gender, disability, ethnicity - we know who these are - while providing as much classroom and whole-school context as possible where the children are protected.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, there is the concept of multifinality and that is where the concept of resilience is important.  Research shows and we have seen how harmful to mental health bullying is.  However, the relationship between bullying and mental health problems is not linear.  It can be mediated and that is where resilience comes in by a number of processes that promote the resilience of the person. <\/p> <p>  We know what the factors are to deal with the trauma and to prevent further exacerbation of the problem and of the bullying.  Research has shown that, where children are at risk of being or already being bullied and are therefore at risk of mental health difficulties, they benefit from the support of peers.  There could be peer support schemes or mentoring.  An important point can be having a stable, close relationship with a teacher at the school, a sort of mentor.  That will be a scaffold of support.  It is also of importance that they have understanding parental support.  A further important factor can be their work, as Professor Hymel and Dr. Downes were saying, on developing a more positive self-concept, believing more in themselves and self-efficacy.  Socio-emotional learning can work in that way.  There are also social skills such as learning to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in certain situations, how not to exacerbate a problem such that it becomes more violent, for example, and how to make the best decision in a difficult situation.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the concept of resilience, I agree we should not put the onus on the victim or expect them to be resilient in tough situations.  The idea is to remove the unjust structures and tough situations.  While we work to provide a context at school, at home and in the community where bullying does not thrive, we have to give at the same time a resilience vaccine to children at risk so they are strengthened when they face a bullying situation, first, in how they deal with it and, second, so it does not have so much psychological impact on their well-being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Carmel Cefai"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>The one thing resilient kids have in common is they have one adult somewhere that they trust and that supports them.

We talked abut words we like and words we are not such big fans of.  For me, the word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; does not really describe the extent of what we face sometimes.  It does not seem to capture the seriousness.  Two earlier contributions mentioned how bullying leads to suicidal ideation.  That is the shocking horror faced by the children and families going through this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to many of the presentations we have had during recent meetings, I was trying to get to what a good place looks like.  What does a good school environment look like?  What does a proactive engagement with parents and other leaders in the community look like?  Would some of our speakers like to give an example?  I think Professor Hymel spoke about a play.  In my mind, I have the idea that role plays in schools might be a way to let children know what to do if they encounter a bullying incident, whether they are bystanders, upstanders, the people perpetrating the bullying or the victims.  As the witnesses mentioned, each of these groups suffer the long-term impacts of not taking action.<\/p> <p>  What does the perfect environment look like?  Is there a place for role plays or plays in our school system to help identify the people to go to or people students might trust or, in general, because it happens all the time and to show students how to deal with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#J00400","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I do not know if I can tell the Senator what the ideal school is but I can give some examples.  Role play is important but it has to be done well.  There has been some great success incorporating socio-emotional learning in drama.  We have had people go in and work with students so students have a voice in creating plays and activities they do with younger children which allow for that more intense working out of what to do in a certain situation.  There is a way to do that.<\/p> <p>  I see schools adopting socio-emotional learning and teachers taking it to heart.  In our province, each school has counsellors and that is separate from what they call a social-emotional champion.  We meet every month with representatives from several school districts who talk, exchange ideas or whatever.  We need time to talk, exchange strategies and activities and work together.  Those things operate to begin to create really wild things.<\/p> <p>  The other thing we have done that has been effective is bibliographies.  Many great books can be used.  I love the diversity of approaches.  Different teachers will feel comfortable or uncomfortable with different approaches.  The more we give them the capacity and the capital to take all sorts of different approaches, the more likely we will reach some of those kids and create those environments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Shelley Hymel"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>This is a big question but I will focus on what an ideal SEL school would be like and some examples of good practice.  We need to start by foregrounding SEL.  Socio-emotional education is not yet recognised in many countries, schools or regions as being of enough value to spend resources and invest in its development.  Many schools, and maybe the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, do not help in this way, and are driven by a reductionist view of education based on cognitive or academic learning.  There needs to be more awareness of the importance of socio-emotional education as a crucial part of human development.  One way of doing this is when the whole-school community mobilises its human and physical resources to put this vision of socio-emotional education into practice across all systems.<\/p> <p>  We need to identify the needs of our students and community.  We would start with training the adults in the school before working with the children on socio-emotional education.  In particular, we start with the teachers and school administration so they become converted.  Some teachers and parents are not convinced of the benefits of socio-emotional education.  By doing it and developing these competencies, they can be good role models for the school population.  We would also work with the parents and empower them to educate themselves.<\/p><p>We have to be a bit careful not to be patronising or to blame the parents in one way or another.  As I said, schools can organise training with parents themselves leading.  Once we do that and we have the whole school mobilise its resources with a clear vision, we have trained the staff and we have worked with the parents, we can then start implementing social and emotional education in the curriculum, in extracurricular activities, in academic learning, in the classroom climate and in school bullying policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Carmel Cefai","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>That is so true.

We have restorative practice schools here where there are whole-school approaches.  We are not that far away from it in many of our schools and there are a number of schools where we can see models of real openness.  Conflict is not avoidable in schools, conflict is part of life, and it is a question of how those conflicts are mediated.<\/p> <p>  Professor Cefai made a point that I want to amplify, which is that social and emotional education is not opposed to academic learning.  The academic research points out that social and emotional education improves academic learning because it involves a deeper engagement with the material, deeper connection to life experience and deeper processes of questioning.  For example, in English they are trying to understand characters&rsquo; motivations in a novel or they are trying to understand empathy in history.  Drama and role-play is something which is part of the primary curriculum and can be used as a method across subjects, such as in history, religion or ethics.  There are ways in which role-play helps the key social and emotional education goals, which are empathy and perspective taking.<\/p> <p>  On the point on the ideal features of a school, we can almost sense this when we go into schools.  One of my roles is to go around to different schools on school placement, and I can see the tangible climate in the school where all the school staff are engaged with the school process, they are happy to chat with the children and they talk at the level of the children, so there is democracy in action in the school environment.  It is about all of those whole-school aspects.<\/p> <p>  If I am being asked what other layers there are on that, I have already argued for a whole-school committee to drive through change at a whole-school level, not just one champion but a committee, and to have emotional counsellors and therapists onsite.  What I would add to that is a vision of a school community lifelong learning centre, where the school is available after school hours, where there can be after-school activities that children want to stay for and where parents are engaged.  The role of the arts in regard to bullying prevention and social and emotional education is usually underdeveloped.  There are many different multidimensional lenses to build on.<\/p> <p>  I would add that around secondary school level, many of the wider programmes have been shown to be less effective for older teenagers.  There is a risk that overly didactic approaches will get the teenagers to react against it, and they will do the opposite.  There is quite a lot of research, even going back to the 1970s, that if we try to programme youth into things, they will go the opposite way.  We have to be careful around that aspect also.  With older children, it is about co-constructing meaning-making material.<\/p> <p>  In our report for the commission, we also emphasised how youth would have an input into curricular materials.  In the international research, one of the key features of successful bullying programmes was video.  Videos were actively developed by minority groups who were victims of bullying to show what it is like in their life experience.  To have different minority voices come through in videos is another dimension that international research says has a key impact for bullying prevention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021060800002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I know Dr. Downes presented to us previously and I thank him for taking the time today.

It is great to be here.  It is an honour to have the opportunity to share ideas on these important topics with some former Oireachtas colleagues in the Seanad.  It is great to see MEPs engaging more regularly with the Oireachtas and it will be an ongoing challenge to establish much closer links, not just with the European Parliament, but with other EU institutions in the months and years ahead.<\/p> <p>  The trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, enjoyed a huge majority in the European Parliament following a reasonably short period of scrutiny, but a much longer period of scrutiny than had applied at Westminster.  We are now making progress on the establishment of committees.  Incredibly, there are 19 committees under the Joint Partnership Council and ten of those are specialised trade committees.  There is a vast institutional architecture but all of that is officials, not elected individuals.<\/p> <p>  I want to comment on the parliamentary scrutiny envisaged for the TCA in the first instance.  At the moment, three strands are emerging from the European Parliament in this respect.  The first that is expected is what is called the delegation, so we have delegations to the US, China and South Africa - the delegation of which I am a member - and a delegation to the UK will be set up fairly shortly.  Under the TCA, there will also be a joint parliamentary assembly and it is possible that the delegation will comprise the MEPs who will take part in the joint parliamentary assembly.  However, the powers of that joint parliamentary assembly are fairly limited to being informed of what is going on and to being informed about major changes that might take place, such as the suspension of some parts of the agreement.<\/p> <p>  The third strand is what is going to replace the current UK coordination group and what had been the Brexit steering group.  What is on the table at the moment is that there will be a new scrutiny group in the European Parliament, and it will comprise the chair of the trade committee, the chair of the foreign affairs committee and the chair of the UK delegation, together with 15 rapporteurs from different committees, and maybe one member of each of the political groups.  It is very important that one of the 13 Irish MEPs, at the very least, is present on that scrutiny group.  It will only be a temporary group lasting perhaps one or two years but, at the moment, there is no Irish MEP on the UK coordination group.  Given the critical nature of everything that is emerging from the implementation of the TCA and the withdrawal agreement, that is a significant deficit and one we urgently have to correct.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the protocol, which is the second item on the agenda, there is a very important meeting tomorrow between Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi and David Frost.  We are all very familiar with the tensions that currently exist between the two parties.  Two articles have appeared in the newspapers in the past couple of days, one by David Frost and the other this morning from Vice President &Scaron;efovi.  It does not augur well for the meeting tomorrow.  Nevertheless, some progress is being made on some of the key issues relating to the protocol.  To be honest, and I do not say this lightly, I do not believe David Frost is a trustworthy interlocutor.  He and his cohort have consistently underplayed the significance of Brexit to the island of Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  They have consistently ignored warnings about the effects of Brexit on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p>Mr. Frost and his team rammed through the Northern Ireland protocol in order to get Brexit done and now they are blaming the EU and saying they did not understand it, despite the protocol being negotiated in English between people speaking English as their second language and Mr. Frost and the UK Government.  None of this is very credible and it does not augur well.  Unfortunately for Ireland, we run the risk of becoming collateral damage in the increasing tensions between the EU and the UK.  All of us want to see this relationship being based on partnership rather than rivalry but there are many examples of the UK indicating that it does not want to go down that path and that is very worrying.  As far as I am concerned, there is no alternative to the protocol.  The EU has demonstrated a willingness to exercise all flexibilities possible within the protocol.  The UK Government has to come to the table in good faith and it has not done so thus far.<\/p><p> The final issue on which we have been asked to comment is the issue of EU supports to assist Ireland in dealing with the challenges of Brexit.  From a European Parliament point of view, the key issue here is the Brexit adjustment reserve.  The proposal for the allocation of funding across member states was recently voted through in committee.  This emerged from the meeting of the European Council in July 2020.  Happily, Ireland is going to receive the greatest amount of funds from the Brexit adjustment reserve, an allocation of just over &euro;1 billion.  How that will be applied in Ireland is a matter for the Government.  We will have to see how it operates.  This reserve will be passed in the European Parliament.  Trilogues, the discussions between the EU member states and the Parliament, will happen from 17 July on.  I hope the reserve will be in place by the end of this month.<\/p><p> The Oireachtas, and the Seanad in particular, has a crucial role to play in EU scrutiny.  After Brexit, there needs to be much greater visibility of EU legislation, proposed directives and regulations at Oireachtas level at the earliest possible opportunity.  This will allow for upstream analysis of what is to come.  There have been really good examples of this in recent times.  For example, I had engagement with Member of the Oireachtas on the digital services act and engagement on the digital markets act with Senator Malcolm Byrne and others.  We need to see an awful lot more of this.

I am speaking from Strasbourg.  It is a plenary week so it is a busy time and a lot of debates and voting are going on.  One of the issues that has become abundantly clear to me over the last two years, for which I have had the honour of being an MEP, is that the big issues of our time do not recognise national boundaries.  Issues such as globalisation, immigration, Covid and the climate crisis transcend national boundaries and demand regional co-operation and co-ordination.  We have certainly seen that with Covid over the past 18 months.  The voice of history will show that we need to co-ordinate in much greater detail than we have heretofore.  Brexit goes against the tide of the major movements of our time.<\/p> <p>  The Chair has seen my written statement but I will summarise a couple of issues I raised within it.  Mr. Andrews has already spoken about the Brexit adjustment reserve.  Within the committees of the European Parliament, we have been putting on the green jersey to ensure that Ireland receives the funding it deserves.  I am pleased that approximately &euro;1 billion of the &euro;5 billion fund will come to Ireland.  There were certainly many voices from the other 26 member states arguing that they should benefit from the Brexit adjustment reserve.  My eyebrow certainly raised over some of the demands other countries made in that regard.  A great deal of the money will go to fisheries.  My colleague, Grace O'Sullivan, has argued for stronger support for the small-scale, sustainable fishers of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In some of the committees on which I sit, including the Parliament's energy committee, significant impacts from Brexit are already being seen.  For instance, we have an electricity interconnector with the UK.  This is not operating as well as it was before Brexit.  That results in higher prices for electricity both for people in the UK and for people in Ireland.  That is a very practical consequence of Brexit.  <\/p> <p>  Back in April, I voted for the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  I am pleased that went through the Parliament but it is worrying to hear the constant statements from London to the effect that the Northern Ireland protocol is not sustainable and not fit for purpose.  I think about some of the announcements we have seen made without consultation.  The surprise extension until October of arrangements with regard to pets travelling between Northern Ireland and the UK seems like a small thing, but there was no consultation on this as far as we know.  We have seen quite a bit of grandstanding, which only exacerbates the existing sensitivities that have arisen from efforts to balance the Good Friday Agreement with Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol.  Perhaps a little less ideology and a little more co-ordination from the UK Government would be helpful. <\/p> <p>  I note that Edwin Poots, the new leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, visited Dublin last week.  That was encouraging but I would remind him that, regardless of Brexit, we live on a shared island and that the future lies in regional co-operation and not in the continuation of extreme grandstanding.  Brexit and the future relationship between the UK and Ireland will disproportionately affect the people, and particularly the young people, of Northern Ireland.  Their voices must be heard in all of this.  We have seen the generous support the Irish Government is giving to allow the Erasmus programme to continue without interruption to allow young people who are studying and training to continue to travel and to extend these links between Ireland and other regions around Europe.  Travel broadens the mind.  The more we open up our borders and extend the hand of friendship and of trade to all European countries, the better placed we will be.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and all of the members of the committee for inviting us to this engagement his afternoon.  It is very important.  Since joining the European Parliament, through my membership of various committees, including those on agriculture, transport and tourism and fisheries, I have found myself engaged at the coalface of the key issues involved in the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  I will focus on a couple of examples of the issues I have encountered.<\/p> <p>  There are many issues of concern in the area of agriculture and food.  One in particular relates to products of mixed origin, such as milk which is collected on both sides of the Border before being pooled and processed together to make cheese, milk powder or Bailey's, for instance.  Likewise, there are products such as whiskey, which traditionally moved seamlessly over and back across the Border at the various stages of processing and bottling.  Where products are sourced, processed and packaged exclusively in either the South or the North, their status is clear.  However, where products are sourced or processed on both sides of the Border, their status is not clear.  They may not qualify for trade agreements and, therefore, may be subject to higher tariffs that undermine the idea of an all-Ireland economy.  The UK has taken a flexible approach in this area.  I have questioned the EU's approach and urge the Government to ensure the EU takes an equally flexible approach.<\/p><p> As regards fishing, the most significant problem is the disproportionate loss of fish quotas, which has created great difficulties for an already struggling industry.  The Government must continue to work at Council level for a rebalancing of the burden sharing and to explore practical opportunities such as total allowable catches, TACs, under the Common Fisheries Policy to adjust share of fishing rights to help countries worst affected.  I look forward to the report from the Government seafood task force and the recommendations it makes.  Ultimately, fishermen want to fish and talk of compensation or decommissioning of boats holds no appeal.<\/p><p> In the area of transport and trade, there have been successes and challenges.  The enhanced ferry capacity to mainland Europe which has been delivered by public and private investment has been extremely effective.  However, since the start of the year, there has been a significant reduction in trade between Britain and the Republic.  A corresponding increase in trade with Northern Ireland might suggest it is being used as a back door.  The Government and its agencies need to offer support to importers and exporters, particularly in navigating the complexities of customs clearance.  The removal of derogations in the coming months will further increase the regulatory burden on these businesses.  <\/p><p> Previous speakers referred to the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve.  I have questioned the motivation of some countries who sought, if you like, to reopen the allocation key for the reserve.  I pointed out in a committee that it was something of a cash grab.  It seemed in some way to change the direction of travel of this.  While the European Parliament has agreed its position and that is to be voted through this week, I remain concerned that when it goes to trialogue the Council of Ministers will seek to change the allocations.  It is vital the Government continues to defend the Irish position and does not let the allocation be eroded in any way.<\/p><p> These issues serve as examples of the practical difficulties we have encountered.  As the Member of the European Parliament who lives closest to the Border, I believe the biggest concern of people I know, North and South, is the re-emergence of any semblance of a border, economically or socially.  Recent comments and events have served to reignite these fears.  Suggestions of alternative approaches serve to undermine the structures that have already been painstakingly agreed and are underpinned by international agreements.  This approach is being championed by people who are uncomfortable with how effective the protocol and withdrawal agreement can be and have placed ideology ahead of practical solutions.  Those interested in dividing rather than uniting, looking to undermine rather than build out current structures and concerned with personal attacks rather than finding workable solutions need to stop playing politics with the Northern Ireland protocol and get down to the critical work of forging real solutions for the unique status that Northern Ireland has and which such people have not focused on making enough of.  I look forward to the committee&rsquo;s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Markey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Markey.

I commend the committee on the work it is doing, particularly the examination of issues concerning our citizens and communities as the committee develops its interim report over the coming weeks.  I look forward to the ongoing conversation we will have.  The joy of speaking last among the European Parliament representatives is that my colleagues have covered a great deal of the monumental work going on in Brussels, where I and my Ireland Inc. colleagues are sitting, Strasbourg and our respective constituencies.<\/p> <p>  By ratifying this agreement, we provided certainty to our businesses and citizens and protected Ireland as a whole from the damaging consequences of a no-deal outcome.  The final outcome, as echoed by all colleagues, was a great example of Ireland Inc. working together and coming together.  All 13 Irish MEPs put on the green jersey and voted in favour of its adoption.  It was a welcome stance given Brexit is far from over and our communities still need us to stand together to protect the interests of all communities and businesses throughout the island.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, in the early weeks of this year, we saw some difficulties in the management of Brexit and Article 16.  I commend the swift backdown by the Commission, which was necessary and welcomed.  It should never have happened and needs to be acknowledged but to focus on this and distract from the significant support we have received from the Commission and fellow EU member states would dismay me.  The support we have received since the Brexit vote in 2016 shows the power, co-operation and strong relationships between our representatives, Government Ministers, Senators, including the committee members, local representatives who are the focal point of connecting to our constituencies and businesses, and our EU colleagues.  Not only did Europe put Ireland&rsquo;s concerns at the heart of Brexit negotiations, it has also pledged to deliver significant financial support to offset the impact of Brexit.  It is imperative that we, across all political houses, continue to work together to achieve what the agreement sets out in terms of protecting our citizens and businesses.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, we will see continued engagement this week, as my colleagues alluded to.  We will hopefully see both sides take stock of the progress made and look at the holdbacks our communities are experiencing on the ground.  My colleague, Mr. Markey, alluded to some of those.  The continued intensive engagement between the EU and the UK on the implementation of the protocol is welcome.  The shared goal must be achieved, even if it is tiresome to watch given that not everybody seems to be on the same page at all times.  It is in the best interests of our communities and businesses that we, as representatives in the European Parliament, continue to engage and look forward to progress.<\/p> <p>  Barry Andrews highlighted the Brexit adjustment reserve.  There is &euro;5 billion in the pot and it is necessary that we draw down as much as has been allocated.  I will walk through some other areas that I feel we can rely on and lean into.  Not only will the Brexit adjustment reserve support economic sectors, business and local communities and, as Mr. Markey highlighted, our fishing communities by funding employment schemes, training and retraining, it will also support the infrastructure, particularly for custom and security checks, that Brexit could, and likely will, impose on us.  It will support fisheries control, certification and authorisation regimes for products, which essentially means, as far as practical, it will help to minimise the distribution movement of Irish goods.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is the biggest benefactor of the reserve and stands to lose the most, particularly in our fisheries sector.  We are projected to get an initial fund of approximately &euro;1 billion, as colleagues have said.  A total of &euro;109 million of that fund has been allocated to support our fishing industry.  I am working on this with Colm Markey and Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan on this, with other organisations.  We are not just representing large fishing industries but also our small fishing communities to ensure that in regions such as our constituency, specifically places such as Arranmore Island and Killybegs in County Donegal and Rossaveal in County Galway, this money is released quickly, invested wisely and not held back by bureaucratic conversations.<\/p><p>It needs to get down to the communities that it is serving.  There are a couple of other funding initiatives that the EU offers us and a good example of an opportunity to fundamentally change the way we work and move towards more sustainable industry is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which was set up to offset the impact of changes in the world trade patterns and the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  It specifically offers funding to member states to support displaced workers and those who are self-employed to move towards sustainable industries and to support measures to provide flexible working arrangements, childcare allowances and mobility allowances.  This is key in the next stages of the post-Brexit and post-pandemic period in developing the skills needed in the digital age, particularly across the region of the European Parliament's Midlands&ndash;North-West constituency.  It is a great opportunity and we cannot pass these by.  We have benefited positively from the EU funding in the past.  For example, in recent years we have seen funding for research and development through the Horizon funding programme for our third level sector and through the EU INTERREG programmes, such as the PEACE programme, which focuses on building community relations in particular among young people, which is key to this.  I know that Mr. Cuffe also alluded to this.  Youth is our focal point in this and it is great to hear Ireland Inc in the European Parliament also echoing that same sentiment.  With that, I will work with representatives and agencies to ensure that our citizens feel that support.<br\/><br\/>Finally Chair, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament, it is really worth highlighting and commending the Government and in particular my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, on his work in guaranteeing young people in Northern Ireland continuing access to the Erasmus+ programme.  This programme involves, as many members will already know, learning mobility and cross-border co-operation projects for millions of Europeans of all ages and backgrounds.  It is a fantastic programme with many benefits to young people in particular, giving them the opportunity to study, train and gain experience abroad and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We have seen that footfall here in Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, the British Government refused the opportunity to continue to support such a programme despite continued participation being offered by the EU.  Our neighbours decided to leave and we must deal with the footfall.  The decision by the Irish Government supports all students in Northern Ireland being able to participate regardless of their citizenship and students will have access to the Erasmus+ programme by temporarily registering with the Irish higher education institutions.  If anybody is watching this meeting online as this meeting is being streamed, is studying in Northern Ireland and have not quite heard of the Erasmus+ programme, please check it out.<br\/><br\/>I will park it there, Chair and colleagues, and I very much look forward to a fruitful discussion and hope that this will be continued into the future.  I also want to have acknowledged in the committee&rsquo;s report and in these conversations that we should also continue to engage with our local representatives and bring them into this conversation by having the engagement and the experience of those who are working with our community members and citizens on a daily basis, through seeing the footfall and issues at hand.  It is very important that we hear their voices at all of the stages of Brexit that are ahead of us.  I thank the committee and I appreciate the opportunity to speak with its members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Walsh and I also thank Mr. Markey, Mr. Cuffe and Mr. Andrews for their opening remarks and statements.

I welcome our MEPs and I thank them for their contributions.<\/p> <p>It is very reassuring, without being patronising in any way, that we have such a level of competence on the Irish team.  As some of the guests have said and indeed all believe, it is important that we keep that active link between our Parliament and Europe not only in personal interactions on a regular basis but structurally as well, in looking at directives, regulations etc.<\/p> <p>  First, I detect in a number of speakers a great pessimism around the protocol and perhaps a small degree of optimism towards the end.  I just hope that we can have an agreement on the protocol that will not prejudice our all-Ireland free trade arrangements or, in other words, will not return any sort of a Border.  Can I ask our guests to comment again on whether they believe we can reach an outcome there and as to how this is progressing?  One would like to think that despite the bellicose language etc., that it would.  <\/p> <p>  On the Brexit adjustment fund, I got the initial impression that it was without labels but it seems that it is broken down to the sectors in which it must be spent.  It would seem that a section of this must be spent on fisheries which nobody will object to, as such.  I was thinking that the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which will be coming into place might suggest then that the Brexit adjustment reserve could be spent in different areas and that there would be a need for level of national discretion on that.<\/p> <p>  Nobody referred to it directly but do the witnesses believe there is a hope that we can arrive at the veterinary agreement with Britain?  The consensus seems to be that we will.  This would have enormous implications for free trading and the for the non-intrusive movement of goods which would be important.<\/p> <p>  I was very disturbed to hear what my neighbour, Mr. Markey, had to say about products sourced on both sides of the Border and I ask that he might elaborate on that, please?  That would have enormous implications for the village in which I live, in that there is a Lakelands Dairies facility there, which is the only substantial employer with the best quality jobs in the area, of which there are a few hundred up and downstream.   We would be worried if there were difficulties with any of those jobs because Lakelands Dairies has plants on the Northern side and the milk flows in both directions.  It would be very disturbing if anything was to go wrong there and Mr. Markey might elaborate on that point.<\/p> <p>  Is there a risk that were the protocol talks to break down fully and go badly, that might endanger the entire trade and co-operation agreement?  Implicitly it would but could it take the whole deck of cards down and set us back a very long way?  Where would the witnesses see us then at that point?  Let us hope and pray that that does not happen.  <\/p> <p>  Those are just some of the questions that occurred to me.  I find this a very worthwhile engagement and we are going to continue this in the Seanad, as some of our guests and  members will be aware already.  Ms Walsh and Mr. Markey are already aware that we hope to have a full plenary Seanad session on 19 July with MEPs from the Midlands&ndash;North-West constituency and moving then to each of the other national constituencies, month by month or every few months.  This should also be an exciting exchange and has great potential.  I thank our guests for this opportunity.  It is good to be here and I look forward to their responses later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#E00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.  I will try to be succinct but many issues have been covered.  I echo Senator O'Reilly's point that the engagement between the Seanad and MEPs is important.  I will start by referring to Mr Markey's point about enhanced ferry capacity.  Unsurprisingly, of course, I will mention that it remains increasingly important to continue to invest in Rosslare where most of that ferry capacity is being provided.<\/p> <p>  Coming to the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, which follows Senator O'Reilly's question around allowing a certain level of national discretion, I equally take the view that we should also encourage as much national discretion as possible when it comes to CAP.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Cuffe made reference to the issue of pets and to fisheries.  Two of the issues that have come up before this committee in a big way and are of concern relate to some of the rules of origin issues in respect of flour and steel.<\/p><p>The question I have for the MEPs in this regard relates to the Brexit adjustment reserve fund and how it may be allocated, as well as other measures we can introduce.  There are obviously very serious cost implications for flour and steel as a result of Brexit.  Can the fund be used to offset some of that cost?<br\/><br\/>Ms Walsh made important points about the Erasmus programme and Horizon Europe funding.  I welcome that the Commission has now dropped its plans to try to exclude the UK from certain aspects of Horizon Europe funding.  What should we be doing or recommending to Irish higher education institutions and businesses in terms of getting a larger chunk of the Horizon Europe cake, particularly in a post-Brexit scenario where the UK may not be engaged to the same extent it was before with that programme?<br\/><br\/>An issue I have raised many times and that is of concern to the committee relates to the data adequacy decision.  Even though there is a preliminary adequacy decision concerning exchange of data between the EU and the UK, the European Parliament has expressed concerns in that regard and some of those concerns seem to be legitimate.  One or more of the witnesses might comment on that.<br\/><br\/>Finally, Mr. Andrews mentioned the article in <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i>today by Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, in which the Commissioner said the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly if the UK acts unilaterally.

What action should we be recommending to the Government in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#E00400","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank Senators O'Reilly and Byrne for their questions.  I will not touch on everything they raised but will work through as many of the points as best I can.  The scrutiny aspect is very important.  When I was in the Oireachtas, there was a dedicated subcommittee dealing with the scrutiny of EU proposals.  I understand that function has been farmed out to the various committees.  In other member state parliaments that scrutiny is done by an upper house.  In Finland, for example, the Upper House is entirely dedicated to looking at EU regulations and directives and acts as a sort of proxy European Parliament within the Finnish Parliament.  There really is an argument for Ireland to scale up that scrutiny because we scaled it back from where it had been when there was a dedicated subcommittee of the European affairs committee.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly asked what the outcome of the discussions around the protocol might be.  A really sensitive point is coming in the next few weeks, when the grace period in regard to sausage meat and other meat products is due to expire at the end of June.  We have seen before that the UK is willing to make unilateral extensions to grace periods.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi indicated in his article today that the European Commission would act swiftly if that happened.  Tomorrow's meeting of the EU-UK Partnership Council is really critical.  The question of whether the UK will again ignore the agreement it signed up to and extend grace periods unilaterally will become clear very quickly thereafter.  Members may recall that the extension of the previous grace period from the end of March was triggered in the first week of March.  The UK Government explained on that occasion that additional time was needed.  Today is 8 June and something similar has not happened yet.  This would tend to suggest that the UK is prepared to agree something in regard to the grace period in this instance instead of acting unilaterally, which would be positive.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether the whole EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement is at risk, the disputes arising from the protocol and the withdrawal agreement could end up in the European Court of Justice.  As members know, there are infringement proceedings arising from the earlier unilateral extension and that matter could go all the way to the European Court of Justice.  That is a potential remedy but I am doubtful as to whether it will resolve anything.  Many member states are very anxious about the integrity of the Single Market and the implications of the UK ignoring its obligations under the withdrawal agreement.  In effect, a sort of slow puncture in the Single Market is being created if the UK does not implement what it has signed up to do.<\/p> <p>  On sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, measures and veterinary issues, there is an agrifood forum in which DG SANTE and the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are engaged on those issues.  The EU has provided a very good solution whereby there would be a temporary alignment until such time as the UK feels it needs to diverge from the EU's SPS standards relating to food safety and animal health.  We will see what happens in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Before letting the next speaker in, I will refer briefly to the point raised by Senator Byrne relating to the data issue.  I have been interested in that for some time and it is a real worry.  From a practical point of view, Ireland really wants the data adequacy decision to be made.  The example we have all heard about is the Fermanagh accountant doing payroll for a school in Cavan, which involves a data transfer when the payroll is done every month.  Without a data adequacy decision, all sorts of safeguards will have to be brought in by individual companies and public authorities, which will add a substantial cost to doing business between Ireland and the UK.  The European Parliament has passed a resolution saying the UK's treatment of EU citizens' privacy in respect of data is not adequate.  In addition, the European Court of Human Rights has said there are technical shortcomings in the way the UK does all of this.<\/p> <p>  Where does that leave us?  We need to balance the practicality of the implications of there not being a data adequacy decision, and all the costs associated with that, with the reality that the UK is genuinely backsliding.  This is a really strange situation.  Normally with third countries, they are coming up to, and converging with, an EU standard.  In this instance, we are beginning from a point where the UK is technically aligned with EU standards and is now beginning to diverge.  A critical point is that there is a sunset clause of four years in the draft adequacy decision, which means it will be revisited.  The right balance is there and we just need to add certain dimensions, such as making sure there is not mass surveillance for security purposes of EU citizens' data by the UK.  We need to get that locked in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>A number of issues were raised by the Senators.  Before addressing them, I will pull back a little and say that the mood among member states shows they are starting to get a bit annoyed.  The EU cannot really let trading partners get away with not implementing previously agreed conditions.  If the UK were allowed not to implement what it has agreed to implement, other third countries would start demanding to do the same.  There is a meeting tomorrow of the EU-UK joint committee, chaired by Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, and I hope some of the loose ends will be tied up there.  Senator Byrne mentioned the steel issue and the different VAT rates, which are still a real concern.  There are other issues as well.  In addition, we are approaching the start of the marching season in Northern Ireland and we do not know to whom Mr. Poots will be appealing over the next few weeks.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on some hard facts regarding the Brexit adjustment reserve.  The eligibility period is very specific, being from 1 July last year to 31 December next year.  This means member states have two and half years in which to prove they suffered losses as a result of Brexit.  The first funding tranche of &euro;4 billion will be allocated in 2021, with the remaining &euro;1 billion to be allocated in 2024.  A particular issue for the Government is that a lot of money was spent on getting Dublin Port ready for Brexit but, because it was spent before 1 July last year, it does not qualify under the Brexit funding.  It is important to go into the detail of that.  There is quite a large amount of detailed guidance from the European Commission.  I have just tweeted the link to it, if members want to have a read of it.  It is easy enough to drill down through it and it may be of interest and use in respect of the fisheries allocation, for instance, which will make up a large part of the money that is allocated.<\/p><p>Senator O'Reilly had some more detailed questions about the veterinary side of things.  I do not sit on the agriculture committee so I do not have the detail on that.  <\/p><p> Looking at it from the Brussels side, the EU wants to help Ireland in dealing with the very real challenges we have had with Brexit.  The money is there.  It will be allocated in a very above board way depending on the losses that have been incurred.  They will have to be crystal clear in their fiscal transparency.  The EU is there to help us.  Michel Barnier may have moved to a different stage but the Commission's view is that it will continue to help Ireland where we need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>On the link with MEPs, it is vital that we engage in that meaningful way.  Conversations like this are very important.<\/p> <p>  The protocol undermining the trade and co-operation agreement is something we need to be very conscious of from our end.  If we allow that kind of a narrative or conversation to begin, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  It is an international legally binding agreement.  Unless we allow its credibility to be undermined there is no reason it should not hold.  It is very important that our engagement and discussions are about progressing it rather than questioning its strength.   It is very important that we do not create a narrative that others would feed into on that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Walsh mentioned the &euro;100 million towards the fisheries end.  While there is a focus on ensuring a proper spend of the money and appropriation of funds, there is significant discretion at national level in how that money can be spent.  Therefore, it is important that it is used flexibly.  From the fisheries side, the big challenge is how one compensates fishers for loss of quota or fishing rights.  Anything you do in the area of decommissioning or compensation does not wash with fishers who ultimately just want to fish.  I welcome the report that is coming out from the Government task force in that regard this week.  It is a real challenge to determine how one can spend that effectively.  It is not straightforward.  There is significant discretion for the rest of it at national level, however, although much of the spending was before the timeframe.  It is not just about national governments - it is equally about private sector investment.  The funding can be directed in that route too, and that is very important.  <\/p> <p>  The status of products of mixed origin is a major issue, and not just for creameries in the Border area.  The whiskey industry has a very integrated supply chain across the island.  If that supply chain starts to break up because it is not practical to move produce North or South to get it bottled, for instance, it will cause a major issue at a political level and at an economic level.  It is a major problem in the dairy sector and, equally, in other sectors like the whiskey sector, which is ultimately all about exports.  If the export of whiskey is going to be challenged in relation to its eligibility for free trade agreements, that would be very significant.  It is something that needs to be looked at more.<\/p> <p>  On sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS checks, my sense, based on Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic's comments today and the meetings this week, is that the tolerance at European level for the UK position is waning significantly.  If there is another move similar to the previous move when unilateral action was taken, I do not think it will be received at all well at European level.  There is real concern in this respect.  It is something we have to look at.  I understand that there has been a significant lack of engagement at the North-South Ministerial Council with Edwin Poots and the last number of months.  That could have helped with SPS and particularly with products of mixed origin.  More work needs to be done on that.  Generally, if people are willing to engage, there is no doubt that solutions can be found on SPS and on products of mixed origin.  The problem is the lack of willingness to engage.  The mood in Brussels and Strasbourg this week shows a significant lack of tolerance for any more posturing from the UK.  Europe is seriously considering going down the legal route.  There is no doubt that any sort of legal moves will leave Ireland as collateral damage.  We need to try to get a situation where we can make meaningful progress.  The North-South Ministerial Council is a classic example of a structure through which progress could be made, but there is no engagement.  We have to be careful that we express full confidence in the structures that are available.  There are legally binding agreements.  We need to put it to others to stand up to them.  If we question them in any way, it makes it easy for those who want to undermine them.  There is a legal basis to this international agreement.  Under no circumstances should we tolerate any language of dilution that anyone might try to use in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Markey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>One of the joys of going last is that all the more difficult questions go to the earlier speakers and then I can row in from behind.  Senator O'Reilly suggested that he was picking up a sense of pessimism from us.  I think it is a question of reality.  We have reached a point of frustration and are probably beyond it.  When we speak as Irish representatives at various committees and engage with people in Germany and France, the efforts to figure out why it is so difficult for our neighbours to move on with things are becoming more heightened.  Actions elsewhere are impacting how other things are flowing and moving.  As a centrist politician who is probably a little bit more progressive in some things than others, I think it is incredibly important that we continue to work together, that we are constantly communicating and consistently opening up the lines of communication and that we finish in optimism.  Like many things, politics can change in a day and we do not know whether the UK may return to the EU fold some day.  It is giving other EU states food for thought.  I hope the conference on the future of Europe will highlight the impact the EU has had on Ireland and also, from a solidarity perspective, what the EU as a whole has done for other member states.  As Mr. Markey said, we must continue to engage and drive forward.<\/p> <p>  I am looking at a note my team just passed.  A question was asked about the future growth loan scheme coming out of the Brexit adjustment fund and the agricultural sector.  That scheme provides a long-term lending option to SMEs in the agriculture sector, with terms of seven to ten years to support strategic investment for sustainability and growth.<\/p><p>No doubt many Senators are already aware of that but I highlight it for anybody watching from home or online.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has been phenomenal and continues to do great work in providing a range of financial supports in respect of Brexit, including upskilling, reskilling and continuing engagement on Brexit.  Everything can be found its the website.  Equally, our local enterprise offices have access to a number of financial supports for those looking into continuing to live, exist and operate through Brexit, such as training in online vouchers and microfinancing loans.  They also support other supports available through InterTradeIreland and so on and so forth.<\/p><p> On Senator O'Reilly's point about whether the protocol could set us back, I do not want to cross over my other colleagues' input but I will add to it by saying that, as a country, now is a crunch time.  We need to see the UK step up to the plate in wanting to see balance and fairness for all citizens throughout the island of Ireland in particular.<\/p><p> I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for highlighting Horizon and ERASMUS+ funding because they are incredible instruments for us as an island, considering we are now the leaders in being a predominantly English-speaking country.  We need to use that in our favour.  From speaking with people in some third level universities, particularly those on education and training programmes, we see many cross-EU funding applications.  I am happy to provide more information on those.  We link in quite closely with, and I send many organisations to, Teresa Lennon, who is head of the Irish Regions European Office.<\/p><p> The Committee of the Regions plays an instrumental role for us in keeping an eye on what we could be buying into or adding to.  The fact is that we have not just investments coming in from overseas, especially the US, but also both a trained labour force and a youth sector that is really engaged in third level education.  In particular, I see huge success in vocational and educational training in how we are further lifting our idea regarding studying.  Going to a certain university and having that third level or on-site experience can certainly be of benefit.  I see a cross-EU application area for that linked into Horizon funding and ERASMUS+.  I ask the committee to come back to me if members want specifics.  Billy Kelleher was at the meeting the day I attended with Teresa so no doubt the committee will talk to him.<\/p><p> Mr. Andrews picked up on the data adequacy decision so I will park that.<\/p><p> On flour and steel and other commodities, again, I sit on the employment and culture committees as well as the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, so forgive me if I miss some important information.  I spoke with businesspeople, particularly in the west of the country, around the time Brexit was really gaining a foothold in the Parliament.  I asked them about trade, what opportunities they were seeing and whether they were seeing any impact.  One supplier, who worked for a large supermarket food chain, said he struggled to find the likes of yoghurts and dairy goods coming from the Republic of Ireland.  He just could not get them in time.  That person is connected to a business in Northern Ireland and now has a growing trade.  That is probably a very easy and simplistic example to give, but there is a huge opportunity for us if we can get Northern Ireland on board in creating really good language and trade co-operation within the island of Ireland.  Again, further opportunities for us to grow our businesses are certainly welcome.  I will park it there and pass it back to the Chair.  I see a number of hands up so I look forward to more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>It is great to see everyone on board.  I can feel Ms. Walsh's pain in that for Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and I, and whoever else is on this call, all the questions have been asked at this stage.  I was beginning to think that Senators Joe O'Reilly and Malcolm Byrne were the spokespersons for the entire committee.  I am only messing of course.<\/p> <p>  On a more serious note, this is a very welcome opportunity to speak with MEPs.  Other speakers have mentioned the fact that perhaps some ongoing engagement like this would be very welcome.  I, for one, am very much in favour that.  It is refreshing and encouraging to see from all the contributions this afternoon that all the MEPs are collectively wearing the green jersey for the betterment of all our citizens.  That is great to see.  As Senator Joe O'Reilly outlined, we are very fortunate to have such a competent team representing us in Europe.  Mr. Andrews mentioned EU scrutiny of legislation, which, again, is vitally important.  I believe the Seanad has a great role to play in that.  It is something I would like to see develop if we ever get to a point where Brexit does not get the main headline of the day.  I look forward to that happening.<\/p> <p>  The European Parliament and the role of MEPs are so important.  I would not underestimate that because many laws and regulations emanate from Europe.  I still feel that citizens of this State do not fully get that.  We all have a job of work to do in educating not just ourselves, but the entire population, of the importance of Europe and the importance of us all tuning into what is going on there.  I know this is an old chestnut, but how do we make people sit up and take notice of what goes on and of the role of MEPs?  There is a job of work to be done there, not that MEPs should sell themselves by any means, as they are all well fit to do that, to make Europe and its goings-on centre stage for Irish citizens.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the point on the protocol, is the rest of the EU pulling the hair out of its head at this stage?  Brexit has dominated and been the main headline in Europe for the last number of years.  Even though the vote has now taken place, we are still talking about it and it just seems to be ongoing.  Is there a sense of frustration among other EU countries that this particular topic still dominates the landscape, perhaps at the expense of other issues be they climate change or whatever?  Do the witnesses get a sense of frustration among their colleagues when they are in Europe?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cuffe mentioned an issue I was thinking about as well, which is the protocol and the temptation for the EU to just go and get this done once and for all, and the effect it could have on us here, particularly on the situation in Northern Ireland.  Edwin Poots is the new Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, leader and we are all watching that space at the moment to see how things pan out.  It is a worrying time for us all as we watch the goings-on in Northern Ireland.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is speaking after me and is closer to it than I am, but I have concerns and worries about it.  I can certainly understand the temptation and desire in Europe to finally get Brexit done, get all the parts of the protocol wrapped up and get on with life again, so to speak.  We have to keep an eye on the calendar as well because we are coming towards the marching season in Northern Ireland.  Edwin Poots is trying to find his space and trying to appeal, perhaps, to both sides of the DUP coin.  That is fraught with danger because there are elections just around the corner as well.<\/p><p>That is all in the mix and I am fearful about it.  Frustrating as it might be, I am conscious that we should take a deep breath again and try to tread carefully in the context of any decisions we make in this regard.<\/p><p> My main concern is the frustration that might exist in other EU countries.  They are sick and tired of talking about Brexit, Ireland and all the rest of it.  Do the witnesses envisage this having a negative impact on relationships among themselves and their colleagues as we move forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#H00200","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Feisir&iacute;.  I welcome the opportunity to hear from and engage with our MEP colleagues this afternoon.  As others have said, the more of these kinds of discussions, the better.  It is not the fault of our MEP colleagues but the stark issue for me is the lack of representation for a citizen like me and the many hundreds of thousands of citizens like me in the North who, while retaining Irish and EU citizenship, no longer have representation in the EU institutions despite our clear democratic opposition to Brexit being forced upon us in the first place.<\/p> <p>  Ms Walsh rightly lamented the British Government's decision not to continue to allow access to Erasmus for us but the Irish Government decided not to allocate the additional seats to citizens in the North.  That was a real failure on its part.  I do not want to bring the discussion down another track but that is an important point to make at a meeting like this, at which I have the opportunity to engage with MEPs.<\/p> <p>  As with my colleagues, I welcome the ongoing solidarity and certainty regarding the protocol.  We need to remain steadfast in respect of it regardless of what occurs.  Colleagues have talked about various political uncertainties in the North but adherence to, the implementation of and the effectiveness of the protocol as we navigate the choppy waters have to be key.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cuffe spoke about generosity.  I do not know whether he misspoke.  It was a poor choice of words on his part.  He spoke about the generosity of the Government in continuing access to Erasmus.  I do not think any of us is looking for generosity or benevolence.  We are just looking for our rights and entitlements, particularly given that we lost so many as a result of Brexit.  This brings to mind two issues that have come to the fore for me, particularly over the past couple of days.  Some of the MEPs will not necessarily be able to answer my question but I hope they will be able to assist us in seeking clarity and gaining support for a resolution to these issues.<\/p> <p>  My first question is on the European health insurance card.  There were provisions made in the omnibus legislation such that if there were to be no agreement on that, the Irish Government would put a scheme in place.  It has transpired that the British Government has introduced the global health insurance card, albeit emblazoned with a huge Union Jack, for people in the North.  Nevertheless, it has been revealed in the media in the North in the past couple of days that there are several countries in which we will not have insurance, such as Switzerland and Lichtenstein.  We need clarity on that.  If colleagues in the European Parliament could be of assistance in that regard, it would be helpful.  I am going to try to achieve clarity at our end in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  My other question is on the digital green certificate and on how EU citizens, including Irish citizens and anyone beyond that in the North, will be able to access it.  Will it be based on residency?  Is there work we can do to ensure there will not be another right denied to us in the North?  When I raised this with the Minister for Health in the Seanad last Monday, the one-sentence response I got was that it is being looked at.  Given the roll-out of the vaccine scheme and what I hope will be more positive and safe liftings of restrictions, we are coming to the point where it will become a live issue for people, whether they want a holiday or to travel for work and business purposes.  If that is not on the radar of MEP colleagues yet, it may be a matter they can take note of.  Collectively, right across the board in the spirit of wearing the green jersey that people have referred to, we should not just obtain clarity on the issue but also work to ensure citizens of the EU and Ireland who are trapped in this Brexit situation against their will can continue to avail of rights and entitlements as opposed to losing even more of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#J00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I will be very brief because I realise the meeting has been going on for a long time.  I am probably the final speaker and most of the questions have been asked.  I would like to return to the issue of agriculture and the produce that frequently crosses the Border.  Produce coming from the North to the South basically comprises raw milk and other materials.  There is also produce going in the opposite direction.  I refer to the export of in-calf Friesian heifers.  This is a significant trade for the dairy industry in the South.  This is being grossly affected by Brexit.  Issues pertaining to that need to be considered.  I refer in particular to the certification of live animals and how this will work.  This will be a major issue for us, particularly at the back end of the year.  Regarding Irish whiskey and Lakelands Dairies, coming up with a solution presents a significant issue.  I am open to correction but 40% of the milk from Lakelands Dairies comes from the North.  It is a significant volume.  We are aware the milk price is quite buoyant at the moment.  Any disruption to that market could see major change very quickly.  We need to start considering the key issues.<\/p> <p>  Some speakers have mentioned how the fishing industry has been grossly affected by Brexit.  In southern parts, the fishing industry is probably the one most affected.  The proposed cuts, if made, will see places such as Castletownbere, Baltimore and Union Hall devastated.  These are really rural parts that very much depend on the industry.  It is not just a matter of the activity of fishing because it is about the knock-on effect.  If the proposed cuts are made, it will be devastating in the parts of the world in question.  Putting a fund in place to protect the affected communities is one thing but the point is that any loss to the quota will significantly affect their survival.  With the deepest of respect, putting broadband and everything else into these remote areas just will not do.  This is too big an issue for them.  Fishing is the primary industry.  The fabric of society will collapse if something is done to protect them.<\/p> <p>  I have been asking and talking about Brexit having thrown politics and economics up in the air for the past three or four years.  Covid has added to this.  The tourism industry in Ireland has been devastated.  While we had good news in the past few days with the opening up of outside dining, what is the potential for an all-Ireland tourism strategy considering the chaos we are currently seeing?  Tourism is going to be one of our really significant drivers.  Unfortunately, the market we are talking about is that of 2023.  Unfortunately, the prospects for 2022 are nearly gone because it is going to be very hard for international travel to open up.  We are not going to have the trade shows.  We are not going to have the liners and aeroplanes to bring to Ireland the millions who have traditionally come here.  Where will the all-Ireland tourism strategy come from?  Where will we find the political drive to deliver it on the ground?  While I believe there is genuinely a will to achieve this, will anything happen given the chaos we are seeing?  The knock-on effect will be huge for Border counties and the Republic as a whole.  It will be devastating for the North unless a coherent plan can be put in place.<\/p> <p>  I referred to 2023 because that is the space we are in at the moment.<\/p><p>That is the what we are planning for in west Cork.  We may have ten liners visiting Cobh next year but we will have on average 100 liners visiting in future.  That is the logic of it.  It will take another 18 months for the business to build.  Where is the political drive, including in Europe, to put this policy together?  How can we ensure this happens by 2023?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#J00300","speaker":"1666","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Lombard.  All members who indicated have contributed.  I will ask a question and then go to our guests in reverse order, with Ms Walsh responding first this time, followed by Mr. Markey and Mr. Andrews.  As with Ms Walsh, all of my questions have been.  There is one area of particular interest to me that I will focus on because it does not get attention, as Mr. Andrews noted.  It is the issue of parliamentary scrutiny and oversight of the implementation of the agreement.  I was not aware that we did not have an Irish MEP on the European Parliament's United Kingdom coordination group.  When will that membership come up for renewal again?  Will there be an opportunity to get an Irish MEP on to the group?  When will the new scrutiny group replacing the Brexit steering group be in place and when will be know if we have Irish MEPs on it?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Andrews referred to the limited powers of the EU-UK parliamentary partnership assembly, which is to oversee the agreement.  That is a cause for concern.  It is such a high-level body and perhaps we do not pay enough attention to it.  We need to ensure that citizens have oversight through their representatives.  Mr. Andrews stated the Parliament will be informed of decisions on or changes in the operation of the agreement.  Is it possible for parliamentary partnership assembly to make recommendations to follow through on that and to direct that something might happen?  If it does not have such powers, is there an argument for having these powers introduced?  There needs to be a mechanism by which citizens, through their MEPs, can have a say on how this is operated rather than, effectively, civil servants running it without any parliamentary oversight.  That is my first point.<\/p> <p>  My final comment is on the Northern Ireland protocol.  As I have stated previously, I have serious concerns regarding the vote that will take place in Stormont in four years' time to allow for the continuation of the protocol.  We should not take the outcome of that vote for granted.  We are told the veterinary agreement will deal with 80% of the problems that have been identified.  We hear time and again from the Unionist community, particularly the DUP, that it does not matter how much one tinkers around the edges, adjusts or amends the protocol, the very fact that it exists is abhorrent to it and it will not support its continuation in any shape or form.  I do not know what we should do about that, to be honest.  Continued engagement North and South and east and west is very important but I have concerns that this will be a live issue in Northern Ireland politics from now onwards.  I would appreciate comments from our guests on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#K00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thought we were in a good flow when we started with the lads and then transitioned to mise anseo.

I will revert directly to the Chair on what I am hearing as she is only down the road from me.<br\/><br\/>On the vote on the protocol in four years&rsquo; time, as with the Chair, I do not see a solution yet other than through continuous engagement, working with citizens North and South and highlighting that solidarity is needed now more than ever.  I also anticipate and hope that, as part of the Conference on the Future of Europe which was officially launched on 9 May and will run until next year, space will be given to look at what Brexit means to our citizens and political representatives, including at local level, within the space of citizen engagement and in anticipation of what things will look like in four years because Brexit is not going away any time soon.  It will continue to be a talking point, which is the reason conversations are needed, whether on one or two issues or, as with this engagement, covering a series of issues in order that we all learn from each other and Ireland Inc. is not resting on the shoulders of certain MEPs in the European Parliament but on all of us.<br\/><br\/>On Senator Lombard&rsquo;s point, because I do not sit on the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, AGRI, I will let our colleague, Mr. Markey, respond on the issue of produce.  <br\/><br\/>On tourism and the all-Ireland strategy, there is funding available for North-South tourism promotion.  I love Senator Lombard&rsquo;s vision on this.  I see Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile nodding his head in agreement.

I will speak to some of my colleagues on that issue. <br\/><br\/>On the digital certificate, about which I was also asked by a constituent living on the Border yesterday, the latest news I have from the permanent representative in Brussels is that it is currently based on residency but the EU is in negotiation with third countries, including the UK and the US, on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates.

Senator Gallagher and the Chair spoke about speak about EU scrutiny and I welcome the points made.  We can certainly work together on that, as it is a fitting space.  We have a very important role to play in homing in on solidarity.<\/p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked how we can get people to engage with the European Parliament and the EU institutions as a whole.  I have been scratching my head about that since I ran for office in 2019.  As a person new to politics, when I meet citizens I am consistently asked what happens in the European Parliament, what does an MEP do and how can people engage with the EU, other than seeing the symbol on buildings and roadsides.  There has to be some education on this.  <\/p> <p>  Without attaching too much weight to the Conference on the Future of Europe, it can really help us, as Irish citizens, to take an all-island approach to talking about what the EU has given us, what we want to see being learned from it, what each institution does and develops for us and to connect those who feel most disconnected from the EU overall.  <\/p> <p>  A great deal of what happens in the institutions has an impact.  The impacts may not be immediate because it can take from three to five years for proposals to be enacted.  Many great things happen here but the media is not picking up on them or we are not communicating effectively across all channels, both traditional and social.  Perhaps we should invest more in the blue star programme, which is a brilliant initiative for our primary schools, and the European Parliament ambassador school programme for transition year students.  Are there ways for us to do that?  I have not found a solution.  At the Committee on Culture and Education I am looking at how we can entice third level students to see the vision of what Europe has brought for us, other than through Erasmus+ because not everybody opts in to that programme.  We need to ensure we bring all citizens together on that.  I will connect separately with Senator Gallagher on that to see if we can figure out ways to together on that in the constituency.<\/p> <p>  On the sense of frustration with Brexit, I am interested in hearing the views of Mr. Markey and Mr. Andrews on this.  In the committees on which I sit there is a sense of frustration.<\/p><p>That is not necessarily being placed on us and it is more of a frustration that a former member, our neighbour, is not adhering to diplomacy and democracy in the way that we have built the institutions to be.  There is also the fact that this polarised vacuum conversation happens, so we see that one says one thing in the press and the other posts out a tweet to say another thing, and it is building up to a space where nothing ever happens and we continue on this track of &ldquo;he said, she said&rdquo;.  What creates fear, and it has been mentioned a number of times, is that we are coming into the marching season and we have seen unrest.  We will continue to see unrest, I believe, if we do not have players around the table to have these honest conversations.  The frustration for my vision is this idea of the United Kingdom versus us, as a country or as representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I will try to take the issues from top to bottom.  The importance of Europe was raised by Senator Robbie Gallagher and his point was quite reflective.  On the ground, the image of Europe has not been helped in the last six or 12 months.  The Brexit issue probably has not helped but, equally, there is the whole vaccine situation and, although it has probably improved in the last month or two, the perception of Europe is not as good as it should be on the ground.  Ireland was always a very pro-European country but there is a disconnect and it is very important that we bridge that disconnect.  The forum on the future of Europe is a part of that but we have to be careful it does not become a PR exercise for Europe.  It has to be about people engaging with the substance of the issues, and the talk of scrutiny of legislation being brought into an Irish context is very important because it makes all that European activity relevant.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Senator&rsquo;s comments about worrying times in the North, that commentary was very fair.  There are obviously those who are trying to stoke up a bit of fervour coming into the marching season and there is a need, particularly at European level, to let that pass to some degree, and then let us have the conversations in more measured times than in the middle of the marching season.  Perhaps we can buy a little time and move it to the autumn, where it might be more straightforward to have a conversation and the grandstanding might be gone at that stage.  To be honest, every time I have seen a new leader on the unionist side in the North, grandstanding in the early days has always been a big part of it.  That might change a little over time, so the Senator's suggestion about the season we are in and taking a little time is very important.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the rest of the EU and Brexit, there is a distinct frustration or lack of tolerance at a couple of levels, in particular in regard to it taking centre stage and being a distraction from the rest of the work being done.  That is the first point.  The second is the fact it was felt that the measures were put in place and that this should, in many ways, allow things to progress, and a lot of work was put into that.  As much as anything, there is the broader question of whether this is impacting on the EU and what the collateral damage for Europe in the long term could be if a country cannot hold to its commitments, and whether this means other countries would look at this.  The unity and the definition of what it is to be part of the EU has been challenged by some of this, and that is a frustration at European level.<\/p> <p>   I will move on to the points from Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.  With regard to the digital green certificate, from the get-go, at European level the sense was that this is something that Europe was open to rolling out on a broader basis if others were willing to co-operate with it.  That is the starting position from Europe.  The question then is whether others are willing to engage on the other side.  There is certainly interest in engaging in regard to the vaccines but, in the broader sense, it will take the other parties to come on board in order to get co-operation.  Certainly, from the European perspective, while the digital green certificate came in for an enormous amount of flak at the start from pressure groups, the general consensus is that it is a good idea.  It is definitely something I would see like to see rolled out to the UK and the USA but it remains to be seen.<\/p> <p>  In regard to a health insurance card, I would not comment as I am not an expert.  I appreciate the point the Senator is making about the number of countries that are outside and I can certainly come back to the Senator on that scenario.  It is important that, in all these measures, and it is no different from the Erasmus programme, we bridge the gap and keep everyone unified in whatever way we can because it might be good in the longer term.<\/p> <p>  Senator Tim Lombard raised several points.  On the situation on products of mixed origin, there is a point that has not been covered.  That is the fact that, particularly on the dairy side, in the same way that this product is not eligible for third country trade agreements, it also may not be eligible for intervention-type supports if they were needed in the future because it may not actually be European produce, and there is a question of how we deal with it in that context.  There is a question and there is certainly a need for clarity.  I specifically asked the Commission about this several times recently and it has not come back with an answer.  However, it is vital that the North South Ministerial Council feeds into this because it has the option to come up with workarounds that could be a solution to put forward to the EU, and that has not happened.<\/p> <p>  It is a massive issue when we consider the level of exports involved on the dairy side, but particularly on the whiskey side.  We see Irish whiskey moving up the charts in terms of the competition with Scottish whisky, which was always the dominant player in previous decades.  If that is going to be challenged by us being at a competitive disadvantage because of trade agreements, it is very significant to the future of that industry.  It is something the Seanad should look at further.<\/p> <p>  On the fisheries issues, I agree totally with the Senator in terms of the multipliers, which are different from the agri sector.  In rural economies which do not have many other things, the multiplier from the fisheries side is vital.  When we talk about the cuts in fish quota, the question is where we recover that from.  Compensation only lasts so long and it is only backstopped for 18 months.  We have to look at the Common Fisheries Policy in the longer term - it is a long-term play - and we have to look at total available catch, TAC, so there are those two options whereby we could work our way back from the current position.  With regard to total available catch, that is really looking at other countries giving ground towards Ireland and, given the amount of work that has gone into Brexit in the last couple of years, that is going to be hard.  However, total available catch and the Common Fisheries Policy are two issues we should focus on in terms of the future of the fisheries industry.  If we go back to the Hague preferences from the 1980s, there was a clear identification that Ireland was at a disadvantage and, through the Hague preferences, additional recognition was given.  If we can use that as precedent to suggest something similar can happen again, it would be very important.<\/p> <p>  On the tourism point, I sit on the transport and tourism committee.  At European level, the budget for tourism is extremely small.  When I asked about that, the reason given is that it is due to the fact the competition is between European countries and one is pitching against the other for the same market, that is, the European tourist.  We need to look at this in the context of attracting US tourists or those from outside of the EU so we are looking at bringing additional tourism business into the EU.  That is a way to look at it that may be relevant as a justification for a greater tourism budget going forward.  It is definitely not considered a priority for EU funding currently because it is seen as an internal market rather than an international market, although that is possibly something we should change.<\/p> <p>  To come to the Chairman's points in regard to the protocol and the situation in four years time, as it stands, a significant cohort of people in Northern Ireland are ideologically opposed to the protocol and we are going to have a massive challenge, so I could not agree more with the Chairman.  However, one thing that has not been allowed to be part of the conversation to date, although it may be when the marching season is ended and calm comes again, is the unique status that Northern Ireland has been given in the trade and co-operation agreement through the protocol in terms of having a foot in each camp.  That has not even begun to be a conversation in any of this yet.<\/p><p>Perhaps we have an opportunity to win over people who are currently sceptical about it if, at the end of the day, it is money in someone's pocket.  I always believed that when we were flying during Celtic tiger times, the negative sentiment towards the South from the unionist community was less.  If we can create an economic opportunity for unionism, and everybody in the North, around the TCA and the protocol that gives them a unique status they can build on, then maybe they will start to believe in it.  It is very important that we do that.<\/p><p> On the UK coordination group, while to date there have been no Irish people on it, it has to be recognised by everybody that this group has been very good to Ireland during the workings-out of the past number of years.  In a way, maybe it was more objective without Irish people on it because outsiders on that group were batting for the Irish interest.  That has not necessarily been a negative.  However, at this stage, where it is becoming more about implementation and the latter stages of all this, it is practical, on-the-ground experience that will count.  There now needs to be a change towards, let us say, a more Irish influence, where it is experience of the practical concerns and how they are playing out on the ground that will be very important.  <\/p><p> There is a need for a system approach change from an objective European position up until now to a more considered, practical experience on-the-ground position in that UK co-ordination group.  That could be telling in undermining some of the negatives or misrepresentation that has come from other sides on this as well.  If there are people with practical experience on the ground in Ireland, for instance, who are able to challenge the misrepresentation of the situation, that could be key going forward.  A greater Irish interest in that would be welcome.  There may be a willingness at European level to look at that too because, frankly, in many places across Europe people feel they have given enough to Brexit.  If somebody from this end could step in and offer a few solutions that would move things forward, Europe would be receptive to that.  Certainly, we need to look at getting greater representation from an Irish perspective.  <\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  I appreciate all the questions from everyone.  As we said at the start, engagements like this are very important, especially if we can do it on an ongoing basis.  For one thing, it makes Europe far more relevant at home but it also brings the interaction between the two parliaments closer together.  That is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Markey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623106800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>It is sometimes said that at this stage of a meeting everything has been said, but not yet by everybody.  I feel Ms Walsh's pain coming in, finally.  I will recap the points.  On Senator Gallagher's point regarding reports, we are now in the space where we have to think about recommendations so let me just be concrete about this.  The committee has to take note of the fact that the proximity between Irish and British officials and ministers is gone.  That proximity, which is crucial to developing peace on the island of Ireland, is all gone as a result of Brexit.  Whitehall used to X-ray everything that came from the EU from a common law perspective.  That is gone.  In addition, the political alignment perspective between Ireland and the UK, whether we like it or not, is gone.  The academic review in the UK of what is happening in the EU, whether it is textbooks, university departments, journals, symposiums and seminars, is gone.  There is a new element, not isolation but a new relationship, we need to develop with both the EU and the UK now, separately.  It should be part of the committee's analysis.<\/p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile made a point about lack of representation.  I wrote to the Commission about this.  Under the proposed joint parliamentary assembly there needs to be a specific group where the Northern Ireland Assembly and MEPs have regular engagement.  Failing that, it could be a carve-out of the UK delegation from the European Parliament where there would be connective tissue, as it has been described to me, between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the European Parliament.  In addition, the joint consultative working group is under the specialised committee under the withdrawal agreement.  There is no reason there should not be Northern Ireland academics, and civil society and other representatives, on that join consultative working group, which is supposed to meet once a month.  One way or the other there has to be a dramatic upscaling in Northern Ireland of visibility of proposed legislation coming from Europe, particularly with that vote the Chair mentioned in a few years.<\/p> <p>  On the European health insurance card, as I understand it the UK is proposing to extend its global health insurance card to the three countries mentioned.  We can double-check that.  As Ms Walsh said, the digital Covid certificate, DCC, is intended to be interoperable between both the UK and the US but is caught up in the data adequacy issue.  There is a little recognition around data adequacy and protection of EU citizens' data that is connected to that.<\/p> <p>  On Senator Lombard's point about strong recommendations, there has to be a strong recommendation from the committee on rules of origin and the flexibility being demonstrated by the European Commission, particularly on the issue of warehousing in Great Britain of supplies into the Republic of Ireland.  The recommendation must also include the issue of Northern Ireland inputs into Republic of Ireland products and recognition of that in future free trade agreements.  That is a really critical point we should not be shy to make if we are truly interested in protecting the all-island economy.  <\/p> <p>  Finally, the Chair asked when the scrutiny committee issue will be settled.  I agree with Mr. Markey that it has done much good work for us but I sincerely believe we need representation on this.  It has been on the agenda of the conference of presidents, that is the group leaders, for the past three or four weeks, without agreement.  There is something holding it up but I do not know what it is.  That is where the real power will be.<\/p> <p>  There is a proposed interinstitutional agreement between the Parliament and the Commission.  Normally, the European Parliament merely has the right to be informed about trade agreements under the treaties but this interinstitutional agreement will sit alongside that.  It uses language such as it will give the utmost account of the European Parliament's opinion and it will scale up the European Parliament's input.  This scrutiny committee will have a key role there.  It really is crucial we have at least one Irish representative on it.  I certainly put my hand up for it and I am sure others have done the same.  The problem is I am a very new MEP and new MEPs really are at the bottom of the food chain.  It has been a very interesting experience so I have no idea if I will make it onto that.  I hope that answers the questions and I thank the Chair for the opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021060800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Andrews.  He brings to an end all our questions back and forth.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the MEPs who attended this afternoon.  It has been great to have the engagement.  The sentiment echoed right around the virtual room is that, on both sides, we welcome the engagement and would like to see more of it.  It helps us better understand what the European Parliament is doing and<i>vice versa<\/i>in terms of what we are doing in the Seanad in looking at and scrutinising matters of importance to the EU.  It has been very good.  We will look to produce our interim report in July so the engagement we have had today will form a significant part of that process.  We thank the MEPs for taking the time to engage with the committee this afternoon on a variety of issues.  The questions were very broad and each of the MEPs displayed a really excellent knowledge of all aspects of Brexit, the protocol and everything surrounding that.  I thank them for having that information with them.<\/p><p>For committee members, we have a number of issues to discuss to finalise our report, such as dates and other bits and pieces, to make sure we can report on time.  I propose to organise a private meeting, possibly next week, to finalise those last few details because there is not enough time this afternoon to go into private session.  That brings our meeting to a close.  There is no other business.
