I would like to clarify a number of points.  Deputy Whitmore's amendments were ruled out of order last week as they were outside the scope of the Bill.  I have never sought to hide the fact I worked for Arup and it is clearly stated on my LinkedIn profile.  Arup has somewhere in the region of 1,000 employees in Ireland and I never had anything to do with Arup's work on the proposed LNG plant.  I did not even become aware that Arup was working on this project until after I left the company.  Any suggestion of a conflict of interest on my part is, frankly, ridiculous.  The Green Party, including me, has campaigned vigorously against the import of fracked gas and LNG.  The Government recently published a clear and unambiguous statement on fracked gas and LNG, and it has also committed to working on an outright ban at EU level.<\/p><p>On the ruling of certain amendments out of order, in making these rulings I was acting on the advice of the Oireachtas officials and this advice is strictly in compliance with Standing Orders.

It is not pie in the sky stuff but pragmatic.  It is reasonable and has been included in Bills in other jurisdictions.  It is a practical way to start implementing the just transition, rather than just paying lip service to it.  If there is a legal requirement to include the impact a decision will have on communities, an impact assessment will have to be undertaken in advance, and this can inform mitigation measures that can be included.  At the previous meeting, the issue of just transition was the one we brought to a vote and that was for a reason.

I think that is the appropriate place to put that requirement.  As an indication of that commitment, work is starting in the midlands and three reports have to date been prepared by Kieran Mulvey.  It is the start of a much wider application of our delivery on that legislative commitment, as I said in our previous discussions, to look at how we can broaden that.  I refer also to the work being done by the National Economic and Social Council's secretariat and the extended period of social dialogue we will need in order to meet this objective.<\/p> <p>  The legislative requirement is clear.

The Minister stated that the principles of a just transition are contained in the Bill but they are absolutely not.  A just transition is referred to once in the entire Bill, and there is no definition of it or guidance as to what it means.  This is a golden opportunity to incorporate it fully into the Bill and ensure we will meet our targets in a fair manner.  I do not agree with the Minister that it has been incorporated.  One reference is not sufficient.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, the thing about a just transition is that we have to be proactive with it.  It cannot come after the actions and targets are in place.  A proactive, targeted and focused approach needs to be taken, and it cannot happen after the fact because it will not happen properly.  A reactive transition is not a good transition and it will not happen organically.  In order to ensure the transition is done in a fair and just manner, we need to plan for it, and this amendment sets out how that can happen.  If something cannot be measured, it cannot be addressed.  The first step that needs to be taken is there needs to be an active analysis of which sectors and communities will be impacted and how they will be impacted, with plans set out to ensure that their needs will be met and that the direction of every Government policy will not undermine the right of those communities and those workers to access a just transition.<\/p> <p>  This is a really important initiative.  The Minister has been referring frequently during this debate to the just transition commissioner in the midlands.  The work he is doing is valuable but it has to be broader than that.  Not just one specific area will be impacted but everyone will be.  I have just read in my local newspaper in Wicklow that one of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues is quoted as stating that the Bill should not impact on and undermine farmers in Wicklow.  The way to ensure that is to ensure a just transition because a just transition does not relate just to Bord na M&oacute;na workers but to the majority of our communities, and to farming communities as well.  For the farming community, analysis needs to be carried out on how the obligations that will arise out of us meeting our targets could impact on them and how we can ensure they are not negatively impacted.<\/p> <p>  The amendment is really important.   Despite the continuing references to them, two words in the Bill is not sufficient.

The amendment gives the impression that much of this change is avoidable and that we can start to assess in an academic way the impacts on different sectors.  It suggests that if we think they are too great, there is some way in which we can prevent them or insulate against them.  We have to have a dialogue of the sort the Minister has set out in the section.  We are talking about creating a vision of a different, albeit prosperous, future for many of these sectors, and we are in a position where there is an imperative to change.<\/p> <p>  The concept of a just transition goes through the Government's entire approach.  Under the heading, Mission: A Green New Deal, in the programme for Government, a just transition is set out in several sections, including a commitment to publishing a just transition plan and establishing a permanent commission for a just transition.  There is a recognition that a just transition will go to the core of the work here.  The section before us sets out that one of the conditions to which the Government and the Minister must have regard is the requirement for a just transition to a climate-neutral economy to maximise employment opportunities and to support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition.<\/p> <p>  It goes to the heart of the Bill to create an environment where we deliver change that, unfortunately, we do not have the choice of considering whether we will or will not deliver.  We have to make change but, more important, we have to create the vision of an alternative future that is prosperous for farmers.  If we wait and allow an environment to develop whereby people feel we can put off change until another day, we will do a disservice to those very sectors and communities we are trying to support.  The key is the dialogue the Minister underpins in the section, with the creation of a better and more prosperous sector if it is climate resilient and sustainable in its use of resources and has anticipated the negative impacts, and that that is supported by the just transition strategy set out in section 4(8)(k).  While I can sympathise with people feeling they are threatened, the process we are in has to be about divining that new future, not analysing where we are now and hoping we can in some way prevent change happening, or wholly compensate people for everything that might change in that environment.<\/p> <p>  This transition is unavoidable.  The tone of the alternative being offered, compared with what the Minister has set out, is too static.<\/p><p>It pretends we can stay where we are, take the time to reflect on many sectoral impacts and then decide whether to make change.  We are past that period.  The challenge is to work with communities to find this alternative future, which I am convinced is there.

County Offaly will bear the brunt of the greatest job losses, with 53% of all job losses in the midlands occurring in that county.  Not one job has been created.

In theory, we are working with communities; in practice, it is not happening on the ground.<\/p><p>Let us reflect on the record in respect of seasonal workers in Bord na M&oacute;na.  It was evident from the December before last that we would have a serious situation regarding those workers.  They still do not know what is going on, 18 months later.  How can there be a just transition when a key part of the workforce in Bord na M&oacute;na still does not know what is going on or what role it will play in this?  That is the litmus test.  <\/p><p>I accept the legislation sets out in section 4(8)(k):<\/p> <blockquote> \tthe requirement for a just transition to a climate neutral economy which endeavours, in so far as is practicable, to&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) maximise employment opportunities, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition; <\/blockquote> <p>I accept that principle is set out in the legislation.  However, section 4(8) states: &quot;For the purposes of performing their respective functions under this section, the Minister and the Government shall have regard to...&quot;.  Once the Minister and Government of the day has regard to a just transition and ticks that particular box, then they comply with this legislation.  We have a perverse situation in this legislation where there is no recourse to the D&aacute;il one it is enacted.  The Government of the day, once it ticks the box regarding just transition, can do whatever it likes.  That is not right.<\/p><p>The difficulty is as we have seen relates to rural-proofing.  Every memorandum that goes to Cabinet must be rural-proofed but that is a box-ticking exercise that takes place after the memo has been drafted.  When it goes to the Department of the Taoiseach, then and only then is it rural-proofed.  It is rural-proofed in name only, rather than in practice.  A litany of policy programmes have come forward since rural-proofing of all Cabinet memorandums came into place, which have had a devastating impact on rural communities.  Yet, such policies were rural-proofed.  The same applies to what is presented here.  Once the box-ticking exercise relating to just transition is complied with, the D&aacute;il has no role or function in this whatsoever.  It is wrong.  We will come to the D&aacute;il's function later and it should have a function and role in monitoring the enactment and implementation of this legislation.  As currently drafted, that is not there and I hope the Minister will make that small concession.  Biogenic methane should be treated as something very distinct and the broader issue tabled by this amendment should be accepted by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060800002#D00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>It is not just in the section to which I referred where there is a requirement to have regard to the just transition.

Similarly, right across the legislation in setting a climate strategy, we also have to have regard to European regulations which require us to show the socioeconomic strategy behind that climate strategy.  At every stage in the process, we must check to see if it meets our social as well as our environmental and economic objectives.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Nolan, I absolutely accept that we must be effective on the ground in delivering.

It has taken time to get the European state aid approval in some of those but that is done now and I expect a huge number of community projects to be up and running very quickly to help make the transition happen.  It will continue to evolve.  Further European funding will become available to support a just transition.  Offaly County Council, particularly, will work on disbursing those funds.  Critically, the next phase of the just transition process will engage with the likes of the National Economic and Social Council as to how we spread this approach, not only in the midlands but in other parts of the country.

I can understand Deputy Naughten saying that phrases such as \"have regard to\" would appear to offer Ministers the potential to disregard those were they not of a mood but that is clearly not the case when one puts into permanent statutory form a just transition commissioner, when one has a plan that sets it out and when one complements that with this Bill.  There is undoubtedly an obligation on any Minister that occupies the current Minister's position, to take a view of the same kind that we must endeavour, insofar as is practicable.  That is the highest bar that one ever sees in legislation, one never sees deliver because obviously there are restraints which Ministers must apply to so that they do everything that they could within their power.  That is what \"insofar as practicable\" means in legislative terms.  The combination of this Bill and the other Bill that is coming up the tracks provides the belt and braces that Deputies are looking for here.  One cannot put everything into this Bill.

While I fully accept the overall thrust behind the legislation and the need for it, in some ways I am envious of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, being able to get a Bill such as this through.  It is imperative, for all of the arguments that have been made by committee members during the previous two sessions and this morning, that there is recourse to the national Parliament on all of these targets and their implementation.<\/p><p>Deputies Whitmore, O'Rourke and Nolan spoke earlier about the need for a just transition.  That needs to be reflected in the implementation of this legislation.  However, there is no mechanism for the D&aacute;il to review its implementation on an ongoing basis.  There is a reporting mechanism back to the committee and provision for consideration and consultation with the committee but there is no formal ratification process once this legislation is enacted in terms of the five-year targets and, more importantly, with respect to the sectoral implementation plans.<\/p><p> The Chairman and his colleagues published a report last week on how we could reach a 51% reduction in transport emissions between now and 2030 and he is to be commended on that.  If, however, what the Government is saying and has consistently said in terms of agriculture is accurate, the 51% reduction in emissions within the transport sector falls far short of what will be required.  I do not know what the sectoral targets will be.  We should have that level of clarity before we enact this legislation but at a minimum, that should come back before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for ratification.  That is a specific provision in my later amendments, which we will consider when we reach them.  However, this amendment proposes that the climate plan would have to be formally adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This climate plan must take into account, as set out in the legislation, both the national planning framework and the national spatial strategy, both of which must be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, yet the climate plan does not have to be formally approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> We can talk about all the big bold measures we like but, realistically, we must bring the public and our citizens with us along that road if we are to turn around the challenge we face of global warming.  That is the one aspect of this debate that sadly has been lacking for a long time.  Legislating the National Parliament out of the approval and ratification process will further alienate the public, cause them to disengage and lead to reactions to measures, rather than people acting in solidarity to achieve the overall objective.  I ask the Minister and colleagues to support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060800002#L02000","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>This is a complex structure with many various parts.  We have to set an objective.  The advisory council sets out budgets as to how we will achieve that.  We will keep assessing them and reviewing it.  We set out a strategy to deliver on those budgets and a plan.  It is not only at the plan review stage the Oireachtas will have a critical role.  It will also have a role, as provided in section 6B(7) which states: \"Where a carbon budget is approved by the Government ... the Minister shall cause a copy of the carbon budget to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, which shall consider the carbon budget as soon as may be, and the carbon budget shall have effect from a date on which a motion approving the carbon budget has been passed by the second such House.\"  The section also states where the motion is not approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas under subsection (7), the Minister shall have to have a period of two months to go back on an iterative process of reviewing it.  One could consider any one element and say such and such is not provided for in the Bill but one must consider the entire process.  It is an integrated process in which the Oireachtas has a key role.  If we were to remove the role of the Government to approve the plan, I note there is a later amendment proposing that the Government needs to have more involvement.  This is a complicated structure but that structure is set out.  It involves a role for the advisory council, the Government and, critically, the Oireachtas not only in reviewing the annual report but in approving the carbon budget.  That is the appropriate place to give the Oireachtas the key intervention.  Therefore, I do not support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060800002#M00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1623106800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister brought up the carbon budget, which I intended to address at a later stage but I will address it now.  I fully accept this is a very complex structure.  I also fully accept and do not dispute there are various elements of consultation involved in it with the Climate Change Advisory Council, the committee, the public and so forth.  However, the only ratification role D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has is in approving the 2025 carbon budget.  It has no role in the 2030 carbon budget and the draft of the 2035 carbon budget.  In a perverse drafting of this legislation, if D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the 2025 budget, the Minister can bring in whatever budget he or she likes after that within 60 days.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the carbon budget, it has no function or role regarding it.  It has no say whatsoever regarding the 2030 carbon budget, which is set in stone once this legislation is enacted, and it has the potential to amend the 2035 carbon budget.  However, at this stage we do not have the evidence to allow for us to amend that particular carbon budget, and that is the only role the D&aacute;il has.  If we reject it, we hand that power back to the Minister of the day regardless of what our objections are.  The Minister by presenting an alternative budget or the same budget again to Cabinet, will result in that budget automatically becoming law.<\/p> <p>  The D&aacute;il has no role whatsoever in ratifying the sectoral plans.  The Minister has given assurances regarding a just transition and I accept the sincerity with which they were given.  I full accept where he is coming from and I know his heart is in the right place in that regard, but the difficulty is that in five or ten years' time he may not be the Minister.  The Minister of the day may have a very different perspective.  We could have a Minister in office at that stage who is a climate change denier.  Such a Minister could effectively implement whatever he or she so wishes.  If the D&aacute;il rejects it, the Minister can bring in whatever he or she likes within 60 days and it automatically becomes law.  That is wrong.  The National Parliament must be involved in the approval of this.  Last week many colleagues engaged in heated debate on legislation on the health provision regarding Covid.  People argued the D&aacute;il should have a role in reviewing it.  We cannot argue that the D&aacute;il should have a role in reviewing those restrictions when in this legislation we are effectively giving a blank cheque to the Minister of the day to do whatever he or she wants - to divide up this carbon budget in whichever way he or she wants.  It is imperative there is a ratification process which must be either accepted or rejected by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann without any caveats that if we reject it, we have no further say in it.
